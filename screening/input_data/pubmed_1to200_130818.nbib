AB  - Nosocomial infections pose a significant and escalating threat to both patients
      and healthcare workers (HCWs). By their nature, hospitals induce antibiotic
      resistance in virulent and commensal strains, leading to increasingly severe
      hospital-acquired infections. This study measured environmental exposure
      experienced by domestic staff cleaning vacated patient rooms of a community
      hospital to bacteria in ambient bioaerosols. While they cleaned the room,
      participants wore an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR), from which coupons
      were cut and bacteria were extracted, cultured and enumerated. Extrapolation to
      the full area of the respirator yielded measured exposures of 0.2-1.4 x 10(4)
      colony-forming units/hour, of which approximately 97% collected on the front
      layer of the N95, suggesting a possible role for minimal respiratory protection
      in nonpatient environments. Random resistance testing of 1.6% of the isolates
      showed that approximately 70% of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms
      exhibited resistance to oxacillin and approximately 9% of the Gram-positives
      displayed resistance to vancomycin. These data provide an estimate for mask
      bioaerosol loading that can be used in risk modeling and to refine strategies for
      reuse of FFRs during critical shortages.

TI  - An insect defensin-derived beta-hairpin peptide with enhanced antibacterial
      activity.
PG  - 405-13
LID - 10.1021/cb400591d [doi]
AB  - Insect defensins are a class of small, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides
      primarily active on Gram-positive bacteria. Their roles in maggot therapy for
      treating chronic wound infection have been reported recently. However, a
      relatively narrow antibacterial spectrum together with the lack of a
      cost-effective means of commercial-scale production has limited their
      application. To further exploit the therapeutic potential of these molecules, we 
      engineered the carboxyl-terminal beta-sheet of navidefensin2-2, an insect
      defensin from Nasonia vitripennis, based on its structural similarity to
      naturally occurring microbicidal beta-hairpin peptides. The designed peptide of
      14 residues, referred to as NvBH, spans the beta-sheet region of the defensin
      with two amino acids substituted for assembly of a disulfide-bonded amphipathic
      beta-hairpin structure. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
      combined with circular dichroism (CD) analysis shows that the oxidized NvBH
      (oNvBH), produced from the synthetic peptide by air oxidization in an alkaline
      environment, folds into a typical beta-hairpin structure linked by two disulfide 
      bridges (Cys1-Cys4; Cys2-Cys3). However, such a structure appears not to be
      functionally necessary as synthetic NvBH with a spontaneously oxidized disulfide 
      bridge (Cys2-Cys3) (termed poNvBH) displayed similar antibacterial potency to
      oNvBH. In comparison with oNvBH, poNvBH exhibited higher serum stability and more
      resistance on tryptic digestion. These two forms of peptides are capable of
      killing an array of Gram-positive (including antibiotic-resistant strains of
      Staphylococcus) and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens at low micromolar
      concentrations through a membrane disruptive mode of action. Our work indicates
      that the beta-sheet region of insect defensins is a promising subdomain of
      proteins in anti-infective drug discovery.

TI  - Detection of viable antibiotic-resistant/sensitive Acinetobacter baumannii in
      indoor air by propidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 475-87
LID - 10.1111/ina.12165 [doi]
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii represents a significant cause of nosocomial infections. 
      Therefore, we combined real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      with the propidium monoazide (PMA-qPCR) to assess the feasibility of detecting
      viable, airborne A. baumannii. The biological collection efficiencies of three
      samplers for collecting airborne A. baumannii were evaluated by PMA-qPCR in a
      chamber study. After sampling, the effects of storage in collection fluid on A.
      baumannii were evaluated. The results showed that the culturable ratio of A.
      baumannii measured using the culture method was significantly correlated with the
      viable ratio measured using PMA-qPCR, but was not significantly correlated with
      the qPCR results. It was indicated that the AGI-30 impinger and the BioSampler
      were much more effective than the Nuclepore filter sampler for collecting
      airborne A. baumannii. The storage temperature was critical for aerosol samples, 
      as the loss of viable A. baumannii was minimized when the PMA-bound DNA was
      stored at -20 degrees C or if the collected cells were stored at 4 degrees C and 
      subsequently processed by PMA-qPCR within 1 month. The PMA-qPCR method was also
      to distinguish between colistin-sensitive and colistin-resistant A. baumannii,
      and no colistin-sensitive A. baumannii was detected by PMA-qPCR upon treatment of
      the BioSampler collection medium with 2 mug/ml colistin for 5 min.

TI  - The potential for community exposures to pathogens from an urban dairy.
PG  - 22-8
AB  - The objectives of the study described in this article were to evaluate the
      variation and transport of fungal and bacterial concentrations in the air of a
      northern Mexico dairy cattle confined animal feeding operation (CAFO) and to
      determine the concentration and incidence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus isolates. Two-stage viable cascade impactors were used to measure the
      culturable airborne fungal organisms and bacteria. S. aureus resistant to
      penicillin, ampicillin, or cefaclor was identified. Samples were collected at
      three locations that were designated as on site, upwind of the cattle, and
      downwind of the cattle. The highest concentrations of culturable bacterial
      bioaerosols were consistently recovered from the on-site location. More than half
      of the organisms were antibiotic resistant at the on-site location. Elevated
      levels of culturable bacterial bioaerosols were recovered from the upwind site
      that may have been associated with the surrounding community. Bioaerosol
      concentrations were found in higher amounts than in a facility in the
      southwestern U.S. examined in the authors' previous study. The urban setting of
      the CAFO resulted in a higher potential for immediate community exposures.

AB  - Accidental release of biological agents from a bioweapon facility may contaminate
      large areas, possibly causing disastrous environmental consequences. To address
      this issue, novel halogen-containing reactive materials are being designed with
      the added capability to inactivate viable airborne microorganisms. This study
      determined the efficiency of combustion products of such materials to inactivate 
      aerosolized bacteria and viruses. Spores of Bacillus atrophaeus and MS2 viruses
      dispersed in dry air were exposed for subsecond time intervals to hydrocarbon
      flames seeded with different reactive powders so that bioaerosol particles
      interacted with the combustion products in a controlled high-temperature
      environment. The experiments were designed to quantify differences in the
      biocidal effects of different reactive material powders including Al and Mg, a
      B*Ti nanocomposite, an 8Al*MoO(3) nanothermite, and a novel Al*I(2)
      nanocomposite. Compared to pure hydrocarbon flame, powder-seeded flame (with no
      iodine) produced about an order of magnitude greater inactivation of bacterial
      spores. The iodine-containing material increased the spore inactivation by
      additional 2 orders of magnitude. The aerosolized MS2 viruses (generally not as
      stress-resistant as spores) were fully inactivated when exposed to combustion of 
      either the iodinated or noniodinated powders. Overall, the study suggests a great
      biocidal potential of combustion products generated by novel iodine-containing
      nanocomposite materials.

TI  - Cold air plasma to decontaminate inanimate surfaces of the hospital environment.
PG  - 2004-10
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03480-13 [doi]
AB  - The hospital environment harbors bacteria that may cause health care-associated
      infections. Microorganisms, such as multiresistant bacteria, can spread around
      the patient's inanimate environment. Some recently introduced biodecontamination 
      approaches in hospitals have significant limitations due to the toxic nature of
      the gases and the length of time required for aeration. This study evaluated the 
      in vitro use of cold air plasma as an efficient alternative to traditional
      methods of biodecontamination of hospital surfaces. Cultures of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant
      enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia 
      coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were applied to different materials similar to 
      those found in the hospital environment. Artificially contaminated sections of
      marmoleum, mattress, polypropylene, powder-coated mild steel, and stainless steel
      were then exposed to a cold air pressure plasma single jet for 30 s, 60 s, and 90
      s, operating at approximately 25 W and 12 liters/min flow rate. Direct plasma
      exposure successfully reduced the bacterial load by log 3 for MRSA, log 2.7 for
      VRE, log 2 for ESBL-producing E. coli, and log 1.7 for A. baumannii. The present 
      report confirms the efficient antibacterial activity of a cold air plasma
      single-jet plume on nosocomial bacterially contaminated surfaces over a short
      period of time and highlights its potential for routine biodecontamination in the
      clinical environment.

PG  - 802
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00802 [doi]
AB  - Recent metagenomic studies have revealed that microbial diversity in the
      atmosphere rivals that of surface environments. This indicates that the
      atmosphere may be worth bioprospecting in for novel microorganisms, especially
      those selected for by harsh atmospheric conditions. This is interesting in light 
      of the antibiotic resistance crisis and renewed interests in bioprospecting for
      members of the Actinomycetales, which harbor novel secondary metabolite-producing
      pathways and produce spores that make them well suited for atmospheric travel.
      The latter leads to the hypothesis that the atmosphere may be a promising
      environment in which to search for novel Actinomycetales. Although ubiquitous in 
      soils, where bioprospecting efforts for Actinomycetales have been and are largely
      still focused, we present novel data indicating that culturable members of this
      taxonomic order are 3-5.6 times more abundant in air samples collected at 1.5,
      4.5, 7.5, and 18 m above the ground, than in the underlying soil. These results
      support the hypothesis that mining the vast and readily accessible lower
      atmosphere for novel Actinomycetales in the search for undescribed secondary
      metabolites could prove fruitful.

      bioaerosol.
PG  - 3003-12
LID - 10.3382/ps.2012-02302 [doi]
AB  - In this study we isolated and characterized Staphylococcus xylosus, a
      coagulase-negative staphylococcal species considered as commensal and one of the 
      prevalent staphylococcal species found in poultry bioaerosol. Isolates were
      obtained using air samplers and selective phenylethyl alcohol agar for
      gram-positive bacteria during 35-d periods at different times of the day. A total
      of 200 colonies were recovered and after basic biochemical tests were performed, 
      presumptive staphylococci were subsequently identified by API Staph strips. A
      total of 153 (76.5%) staphylococci were found, among which 84 were S. xylosus (46
      and 38 isolated inside and outside, respectively). Biofilm formation was observed
      in 86.9% of S. xylosus isolates, whereas 79.8% of them showed hemolytic activity.
      There was a strong correlation (92.5%) between biofilm formation and hemolytic
      activity. All 84 S. xylosus isolates were susceptible to amikacin,
      ampicillin/sulbactam, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin,
      linezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Resistance to nalidixic
      acid (86.9%), novobiocin (85.7%), penicillin (70.2%), lincomycin (46.4%),
      oxacillin (42.9%), ampicillin (27.4%), tetracycline (21.4%), erythromycin
      (11.9%), bacitracin (10.7%), and streptomycin (2.4%) was observed among the
      isolates. Resistance to tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromycin, and beta-lactam
      antibiotics was occasionally linked to the tetK, linA, ermB, and blaZ genes,
      respectively. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA results showed similarity
      of 15 to 99% between isolates collected outside and inside the barn, indicating
      genetic diversity of these isolates. Our study indicates that characterization of
      poultry bioaerosol coagulase-negative staphylococcal species such as S. xylosus
      is necessary for assessing their safety status for both poultry and humans.

TI  - Genesis of Azole Antifungal Resistance from Agriculture to Clinical Settings.
PG  - 7463-8
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02728 [doi]
AB  - Azole fungal resistance is becoming a major public health problem in medicine in 
      recent years. However, it was known in agriculture since several decades; the
      extensive use of these compounds results in contamination of air, plants, and
      soil. The increasing frequency of life-threatening fungal infections and the
      increase of prophylactical use of azoles in high-risk patients, taken together
      with the evolutionary biology evidence that drug selection pressure is an
      important factor for the emergence and spread of drug resistance, can result in a
      dramatic scenario. This study reviews the azole use in agricultural and medical
      contexts and discusses the hypothetical link between its extensive use and the
      emergence of azole resistance among human fungal pathogens.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of plant extracts on Candida albicans: an in vitro study.
PG  - 401-5
LID - 10.4103/0970-9290.118358 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plants as sources of medicinal compounds have
      continued to play a predominant role in the maintenance of human health since
      ancient times. Even though several effective antifungal agents are available for 
      oral candida infections, the failure is not uncommon because isolates of Candida 
      albicans may exhibits resistance to the drug during therapy. The present study
      was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of few plant extracts on
      Candida albicans. An additional objective was to identify an alternative,
      inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling Candida
      albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fine texture powder or paste form of leaves was 
      soaked in sterile distilled water and 100% ethyl alcohol, which were kept in
      refrigerator at 4 degrees C for 24 h. Then filtrates were prepared and kept in a 
      hot air oven to get a black shining crystal powder/paste form. Stock solutions of
      plant extracts were inoculated on petri plates containing species of Candida
      albicans and incubated at 25 +/- 2 degrees C for 72 h. RESULTS: Alcoholic curry
      leaves showed the maximum zone of inhibition on Candida albicans followed by
      aqueous tea leaves. The other plant extracts like alcoholic onion leaves,
      alcoholic tea leaves, alcoholic onion bulb, alcoholic aloe vera, and alcoholic
      mint leaves also inhibited the growth of Candida albicans but lesser extent.
      CONCLUSION: The present study renders few medicinal plants as an alternative
      medicines to the field of dentistry which can be used adjunct to conventional
      therapy of oral candidasis.

AB  - Influenza virus spreads via small particle aerosols, droplets and fomites, and
      since it can survive for a short time on surfaces, can be introduced into the
      nasal mucosa before it loses infectivity. The hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-),
      product of the lactoperoxidase/H2O2/SCN- system of central airways, is emerging
      as an important molecule for innate defense mechanism against bacteria, fungi and
      viruses. Here we demonstrated that OSCN(-) displays virucidal activity in vitro
      against the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus. The concentration required to
      inhibit viral replication by 50% was 2 muM when virus were challenged directly
      with OSCN- before cell inoculation. These values were even lower when inoculated 
      cells were maintained in contact with enzyme free-OSCN- in the culture medium.
      The last experimental conditions better reflect those of tracheobronchial mucosa,
      where HOSCN/OSCN- is retained in the air-liquid interface and inactivates both
      the viruses approaching the epithelium from outside and those released from the
      inoculated cells after the replication cycle. Importantly no OSCN- cytotoxicity
      was observed in the cellular system employed. The lack of toxicity in humans and 
      the absence of damage on surfaces of fomites suggest a potential use of OSCN- to 
      avoid mucosal and environmental transmission of influenza virus. Since
      hypothiocyanite is normally present in human airways a low risk of viral
      resistance is envisaged. In vivo confirmatory studies are needed to evaluate the 
      appropriate dose, regimen and formulation.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the antibiotic resistant E. coli strains 
      isolated from bioaerosols and surface swabs in a slaughterhouse as a possible
      source of poultry meat contamination. The highest air coliforms contamination was
      during shackling, killing and evisceration of poultry. The strains showed
      resistance to ampicillin (89%), ceftiofur (62%) and cefquinome (22%), while
      resistance to ampicillin with sulbactam was only 6%. Resistance to streptomycin
      and gentamicin was detected in 43% vs. 14% isolates; to tetracycline 33%; to
      chloramphenicol and florfenicol in 10% vs. 18% isolates; to cotrimoxazol in 35%
      isolates; to enrofloxacin in 43% isolates. The higher MIC of ceftazidime (3.6 mg 
      x l(-1)) and ceftriaxon (5.2 mg x l(-1)) revealed the presence of ESBLs in 43% of
      isolates. From 19 selected phenotypically ESBL positive strains, 16 consisted of 
      CMY-2 genes, while CTX-M genes were not detected by PCR. Maldi tof analysis of
      selected E. coli showed a clear clonal relatedness of environmental strains from 
      various withdrawals.

AB  - An experiment was performed to compare the microbiological efficacy of four
      treatments (oxytetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphonamide, amoxicillin (AMX) or
      enrofloxacin (ENR)) to control experimental colibacillosis induced by an avian
      pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) with reduced susceptibility to
      fluoroquinolones. The protocol was also developed in order to study resistance
      gene transfer. Broilers were first orally inoculated with multiresistant E. coli 
      bearing plasmid genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones (qnr),
      cephalosporins (blaCTX-M or blaFOX), tetracycline or trimethoprim-sulphonamide.
      They were then inoculated in their air sacs with the APEC and treated as soon as 
      symptoms appeared. Internal organs from dead or sacrificed birds were cultivated 
      on non-supplemented or supplemented media. The inoculated O78 APEC was recovered 
      significantly less frequently in ENR treated group (26%) compared to untreated
      group (47%). This was not true for other treated groups. Isolates obtained on
      non-supplemented media had the same susceptibility profile as the inoculated
      APEC. However, one isolate from the AMX-treated group obtained on
      AMX-supplemented media was resistant to AMX only, and one isolate from the same
      group obtained on ENR-supplemented media, showed a resistance profile suggesting 
      acquisition of one of the multiresistance plasmids present in the intestinal
      microbiota. Molecular analysis performed on this multiresistant isolate confirmed
      the presence of a conjugative plasmid with qnr and blaCTX-M resistance genes.
      Thus, the experiment illustrated the emergence of resistant isolates in internal 
      organs, probably via acquisition of a plasmid from the intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Despite the provision of oxygen, antibiotics and treatment guidelines, the case
      fatality rate for hypoxaemic pneumonia is still high in many hospitals in
      developing countries. Methods of delivering continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) are now available which are simple to use, safe and relatively
      inexpensive. This paper describes two methods which may be appropriate where
      resources are limited: (i) bubble-CPAP using oxygen concentrators with an
      air-oxygen mix function and low resistance nasal oxygen prongs, and (ii)
      high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. More research is needed on the
      implementation, cost and effectiveness of CPAP in the management of pneumonia and
      in neonatal care in developing countries.

      infections are not present in the laminar airflow during prosthetic joint
      surgery.
PG  - 589-95

AB  - Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from prosthetic
      joint infections (PJIs) has demonstrated a predominance of healthcare-associated 
      multi-drug resistant sequence types (ST2 and ST215). How, and when, patients
      acquire these nosocomial STs is not known. The aim was to investigate if sequence
      types of S. epidermidis associated with PJIs are found in the air during
      prosthetic joint surgery. Air sampling was undertaken during 17 hip/knee
      arthroplasties performed in operating theaters equipped with mobile laminar
      airflow units in a 500-bed hospital in central Sweden. Species identification was
      performed using MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene analysis. Isolates identified as
      S. epidermidis were further characterized by MLST and antibiotic susceptibility
      testing. Seven hundred and thirty-five isolates were available for species
      identification. Micrococcus spp. (n = 303) and coagulase-negative staphylococci
      (n = 217) constituted the majority of the isolates. Thirty-two isolates of S.
      epidermidis were found. S. epidermidis isolates demonstrated a high level of
      allelic diversity with 18 different sequence types, but neither ST2 nor ST215 was
      found. Commensals with low pathogenic potential dominated among the airborne
      microorganisms in the operating field during prosthetic joint surgery. Nosocomial
      sequence types of S. epidermidis associated with PJIs were not found, and other
      routes of inoculation are therefore of interest in future studies.

TI  - Contact-free inactivation of Candida albicans biofilms by cold atmospheric air
      plasma.
PG  - 4242-7
LID - 10.1128/AEM.07235-11 [doi]
AB  - Candida albicans is one of the main species able to form a biofilm on almost any 
      surface, causing both skin and superficial mucosal infections. The worldwide
      increase in antifungal resistance has led to a decrease in the efficacy of
      standard therapies, prolonging treatment time and increasing health care costs.
      Therefore, the aim of this work was to demonstrate the applicability of
      atmospheric plasma at room temperature for inactivating C. albicans growing in
      biofilms without thermally damaging heat-sensitive materials. This so-called cold
      atmospheric plasma is produced by applying high voltage to accelerate electrons, 
      which ionize the surrounding air, leading to the production of charged particles,
      reactive species, and photons. A newly developed plasma device was used, which
      exhibits a large plasma-generating surface area of 9 by 13 cm (117 cm(2)).
      Different time points were selected to achieve an optimum inactivation efficacy
      range of >/=3 log(10) to 5 log(10) reduction in CFU per milliliter, and the
      results were compared with those of 70% ethanol. The results obtained show that
      contact-free antifungal inactivation of Candida biofilms by cold atmospheric
      plasma is a promising tool for disinfection of surfaces (and items) in both
      health care settings and the food industry, where ethanol disinfection should be 
      avoided.

TI  - Bacterial constituents of indoor air in a high throughput building in the
      tropics.
PG  - 540-56
AB  - Airborne bacteria are significant biotic constituents of bioaerosol. Bacteria at 
      high concentrations in the air can compromise indoor air quality (IAQ) and result
      in many diseases. In tropical environments like Malaysia that extensively utilize
      air-conditioning systems, this is particularly significant due to continuous
      recirculation of indoor air and the potential implications for human health.
      Currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of airborne bacteria
      on IAQ in Malaysia. This study was prompted by a need for reliable baseline data 
      on airborne bacteria in the indoor environment of tropical equatorial Malaysia,
      that may be used as a reference for further investigations on the potential role 
      played by airborne bacteria as an agent of disease in this region. It was further
      necessitated due to the threat of bioterrorism with the potentiality of release
      of exotic pathogenic microorganisms into indoor or outdoor air. Before scientists
      can detect the latter, a gauge of the common microorganisms in indoor (as well as
      outdoor) air needs to be ascertained, hence the expediency of this study.
      Bacterial counts from the broad-based and targeted study were generally in the
      order of 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per m(3) of air. The most prevalent
      airborne bacteria found in the broad-based study that encompassed all five levels
      of the building were Gram-positive cocci (67.73%), followed by Gram-positive rods
      (24.26%) and Gram-negative rods (7.10%). Gram-negative cocci were rarely detected
      (0.71%). Amongst the genera identified, Kytococcus sp., Micrococcus sp.,
      Staphylococcus sp., Leifsonia sp., Bacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp.
      predominated in indoor air. The most dominant bacterial species were Kytococcus
      sedentarius, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus. The opportunistic
      and nosocomial pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also discovered at a
      high percentage in the cafeteria. The bacteria isolated in this study have been
      increasingly documented to cause opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised
      patients, sometimes with fatal outcomes. Furthermore, some of them are becoming
      increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Hence, we propose that indoor reservoirs
      of these bacteria and their associated clinical and more subtle health effects,
      if any, be investigated further.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the exposure of children to
      airborne Haemophilus influenzae in day care centers. METHODS: Air samples were
      taken using an Andersen impactor in 32 rooms designed for children stay. The
      concentrations of airborne bacteria were calculated as colony forming units (CFU)
      (growing on trypticase soy agar) per cubic meter of air (CFU/m(3)). The
      compositions of bioaerosol were determined on blood trypticase soy agar and
      Haemophilus selective agar. Isolated strains were identified using API NH strips 
      and apiweb software. The antibiotic resistance of H influenzae strains was
      determined by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Compared with the proposed
      criteria for microbiologic quality of indoor air, the rooms were characterized by
      the very high bacterial contamination of the air. The prevailing component of
      bacterial aerosol was gram-positive cocci. Airborne H influenzae strains were
      found in 25% of the investigated rooms and were mostly classified as biotype II
      (33%). CONCLUSION: It may be accepted that the exposure to airborne H influenzae 
      is typical of child day care centers in contrast to indoor environments with
      older population. Child day care center contribute to the expansion of H
      influenzae in human population via air. Generally, airborne H influenzae isolates
      from the investigated child day care centers were susceptible to older
      antibiotics such as ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

AB  - Nanosilver-modified TiO2 and ZnO photocatalysts were studied against
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on the surface and against naturally 
      occurring airborne microorganisms. The photocatalysts/polymer nanohybrid films
      were prepared by spray coating technique on the surface of glass plates and on
      the inner surface of the reactive light source. The photoreactive surfaces were
      activated with visible light emitting LED light at lambda = 405 nm. The optical
      properties of the prepared photocatalyst/polymer nanohybrid films were
      characterized by diffuse reflectance measurements. The photocatalytic properties 
      were verified with the degradation of ethanol by gas chromatography measurements.
      The destruction of the bacterial cell wall component was examined with
      transmission electron microscope. The antibacterial effect of the
      photocatalyst/polymer nanohybrid films was tested with different methods and with
      the associated standard ISO 27447:2009. With the photoreactive coatings, an
      extensive disinfectant film was developed and successfully prepared. The cell
      wall component of S. aureus was degraded after 1 h of illumination. The
      antibacterial effect of the nanohybrid films has been proven by measuring the
      decrease of the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus on the surface and in
      the air as the function of illumination time. The photocatalyst/polymer
      nanohybrid films could inactivate 99.9 % of the investigated bacteria on
      different thin films after 2 h of illumination with visible light source. The
      reactive light source with the inner-coated photocatalyst could kill 96 % of
      naturally occurring airborne microorganisms after 48 h of visible light
      illumination in indoor air sample. The TEM results and the microbiological
      measurements were completed with toxicity tests carried out with Vibrio fischeri 
      bioluminescence bacterium.

AB  - Sinusitis is a very common disease and improved diagnostic tools are desirable
      also in view of reducing over-prescription of antibiotics. A non-intrusive
      optical technique called GASMAS (GAs in Scattering Media Absorption
      Spectroscopy), which has a true potential of being developed into an important
      complement to other means of detection, was utilized in this work. Water vapor in
      the frontal sinuses, related to the free gas volume, was studied at around 937 nm
      in healthy volunteers. The results show a good stability of the GASMAS signals
      over extended times for the frontal sinuses for all volunteers, showing promising
      applicability to detect anomalies due to sinusitis. Measurements were also
      performed following the application of a decongestion spray. No noticeable signal
      change was observed, which is consistent with the fact that the water vapor
      concentration is given by the temperature only, and is not influenced by changes 
      in cavity ventilation. Evaluated GASMAS data recorded on 6 consecutive days show 
      signal stability for the left and right frontal sinus in one of the test
      volunteers.

AB  - Microbial contamination of hospital surfaces may be a source of infection for
      hospitalized patients. We evaluated the efficacy of Glosair 400 against two
      American Type Culture Collection strains and 18 clinical isolates, placed on
      glass germ-carriers. Carriers were left to air-dry for 60 min and then exposed to
      a cycle before detection of any surviving micro-organisms. Antibiotic-susceptible
      Gram-negative bacilli were less susceptible (although not significantly) to this 
      technique than resistant Gram-negative bacilli or Gram-positive cocci and yeasts 
      (3, 3.4 and 4.6 log10 reduction, respectively). In conclusion, in areas that had 
      not been cleaned, aerosolized hydrogen peroxide obtained >3 log10 mean
      destruction of patients' micro-organisms.

TI  - Triazole Susceptibilities in Thermotolerant Fungal Isolates from Outdoor Air in
      the Seoul Capital Area in South Korea.
PG  - e0138725
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0138725 [doi]
AB  - Emerging fungi resistant to triazoles are a concern because of the increased use 
      of medical triazoles and exposure to agricultural triazoles. However, little is
      known about the levels of triazole susceptibility in outdoor airborne fungi
      making it difficult to assess the risks of inhalation exposure to airborne,
      antifungal-resistant fungi. This study examined triazole susceptibilities of the 
      airborne thermotolerant fungi isolated from the ambient air of the Seoul Capital 
      Area of South Korea. We used impactor air sampling with triazole-containing
      nutrient agar plates as the collection substrates to screen for airborne fungal
      isolates based on their triazole susceptibilities. This study estimated that
      0.17% of all the culturable fungi belong to the pathogenic thermotolerant taxa,
      among which each isolate of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis showed 
      a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mug/mL or greater for itraconazole.
      Their concentration in air was 0.4 CFU/m3. Seven human pathogenic Paecilomyces
      variotii isolates had MICs of 32 mug/mL or greater and lower than 2 mug/mL for
      the agricultural fungicide tebuconazole and the medical triazole itraconazole,
      respectively. Though the concentration was low, our results confirm the presence 
      of airborne fungi with high MICs for itraconazole in ambient air. Inhalation is
      an important exposure route because people inhale more than 10 m3 of air each
      day. Vigilance is preferred over monitoring for the emergence of
      triazole-resistant fungal pathogens in ambient outdoor air.

TI  - The carbon concentrating mechanism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: finding the
      missing pieces.
PG  - 159-73
LID - 10.1007/s11120-014-0004-x [doi]
AB  - The photosynthetic, unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, lives in
      environments that often contain low concentrations of CO2 and HCO3 (-), the
      utilizable forms of inorganic carbon (Ci). C. reinhardtii possesses a carbon
      concentrating mechanism (CCM) which can provide suitable amounts of Ci for growth
      and development. This CCM is induced when the CO2 concentration is at air levels 
      or lower and is comprised of a set of proteins that allow the efficient uptake of
      Ci into the cell as well as its directed transport to the site where Rubisco
      fixes CO2 into biomolecules. While several components of the CCM have been
      identified in recent years, the picture is still far from complete. To further
      improve our knowledge of the CCM, we undertook a mutagenesis project where an
      antibiotic resistance cassette was randomly inserted into the C. reinhardtii
      genome resulting in the generation of 22,000 mutants. The mutant collection was
      screened using both a published PCR-based approach (Gonzalez-Ballester et al.
      2011) and a phenotypic growth screen. The PCR-based screen did not rely on a
      colony having an altered growth phenotype and was used to identify colonies with 
      disruptions in genes previously identified as being associated with the
      CCM-related gene. Eleven independent insertional mutations were identified in
      eight different genes showing the usefulness of this approach in generating
      mutations in CCM-related genes of interest as well as identifying new CCM
      components. Further improvements of this method are also discussed.

AB  - We present natural polymeric composite films made of essential oils (EOs)
      dispersed in sodium alginate (NaAlg) matrix, with remarkable anti-microbial and
      anti-fungal properties. Namely, elicriso italic, chamomile blue, cinnamon,
      lavender, tea tree, peppermint, eucalyptus, lemongrass and lemon oils were
      encapsulated in the films as potential active substances. Glycerol was used to
      induce plasticity and surfactants were added to improve the dispersion of EOs in 
      the NaAlg matrix. The topography, chemical composition, mechanical properties,
      and humidity resistance of the films are presented analytically. Antimicrobial
      tests were conducted on films containing different percentages of EOs against
      Escherichia coli bacteria and Candida albicans fungi, and the films were
      characterized as effective or not. Such diverse types of essential oil-fortified 
      alginate films can find many applications mainly as disposable wound dressings
      but also in food packaging, medical device protection and disinfection, and
      indoor air quality improvement materials, to name a few.

AB  - Bacterial strains were isolated from the oral cavity of healthy volunteers and
      grown in the presence of Hg-ions (1-10 ppm) or arsenate ions at concentrations of
      0.1-1.0%. To elucidate how bacteria take up and transform toxic metals inside the
      cells, we performed ion imaging and depth profiling with time-of-flight secondary
      ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). This analysis relies on the use of a pulsed ion
      beam to ionize surface molecules that can be extracted into a time-of-flight mass
      spectrometer. By combining the pulsed ion beam with another ion beam in direct
      current (DC) mode, depth profiles are obtained as a result of consecutive removal
      of surface layers. The spatial resolution of the depth profile along the y-axis
      is in the range of a few nanometres, and the spatial resolution along the x- and 
      z-axes is in the mum range. The ToF-SIMS analysis was performed on crude biofilms
      of bacteria air-dried at aluminium foil surfaces, allowing subcellular resolution
      along the y-axis. The mercury ions were found transformed to methylmercury
      preferably in the periplasmic space, and the arsenate ions were found reduced to 
      arsenite inside the cells, close to the cell membrane. The data are discussed in 
      relation to current concepts in bacterial resistance to metals and antibiotics.

TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of periodontal Enterococcus faecalis.
PG  - 1026-33
LID - 10.1902/jop.2012.120050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecalis may contribute to periodontal breakdown in
      heavily infected subgingival sites, particularly in patients responding poorly to
      mechanical forms of periodontal therapy. Because only limited data are available 
      on the antimicrobial sensitivity of enterococci of subgingival origin, this study
      evaluates the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of E. faecalis isolated from
      periodontitis patients in the United States. METHODS: Pure cultures of 47
      subgingival E. faecalis clinical isolates were each inoculated onto specially
      prepared broth microdilution susceptibility panels containing vancomycin,
      teicoplanin, and six oral antibiotics of potential use in periodontal therapy.
      After incubation in ambient air for 18 to 20 hours, minimal inhibitory drug
      concentrations were determined using applicable Clinical and Laboratory Standards
      Institute criteria and interpretative guidelines. The organisms were additionally
      evaluated for in vitro resistance to metronidazole at 4 mug/mL. RESULTS:
      Periodontal E. faecalis exhibited substantial in vitro resistance to tetracycline
      (53.2% resistant), erythromycin (80.8% resistant or intermediate resistant),
      clindamycin (100% resistant to 2 mug/mL), and metronidazole (100% resistant to 4 
      mug/mL). In comparison, the clinical isolates were generally sensitive to
      ciprofloxacin (89.4% susceptible; 10.6% intermediate resistant) and 100%
      susceptible in vitro to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, vancomycin, and
      teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS: Tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and
      metronidazole revealed poor in vitro activity against human subgingival E.
      faecalis clinical isolates, and would likely be ineffective therapeutic agents
      against these species in periodontal pockets. Among orally administered
      antibiotics, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin exhibited
      marked in vitro inhibitory activity against periodontal E. faecalis, and may be
      clinically useful in treatment of periodontal infections involving enterococci.

TI  - Pulmonary and cardiovascular responses of rats to inhalation of a commercial
      antimicrobial spray containing titanium dioxide nanoparticles.
PG  - 447-57
LID - 10.3109/08958378.2012.685111 [doi]
AB  - Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that application of an antimicrobial
      spray product containing titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) generates an aerosol of
      titanium dioxide in the breathing zone of the applicator. The present report
      describes the design of an automated spray system and the characterization of the
      aerosol delivered to a whole body inhalation chamber. This system produced stable
      airborne levels of TiO(2) particles with a median count size diameter of 110 nm. 
      Rats were exposed to 314 mg/m(3) min (low dose), 826 mg/m(3) min (medium dose),
      and 3638 mg/m(3) min (high dose) of TiO(2) under the following conditions: 2.62
      mg/m(3) for 2 h, 1.72 mg/m(3) 4 h/day for 2 days, and 3.79 mg/m(3) 4 h/day for 4 
      days, respectively. Pulmonary (breathing rate, specific airway resistance,
      inflammation, and lung damage) and cardiovascular (the responsiveness of the tail
      artery to constrictor or dilatory agents) endpoints were monitored 24 h
      post-exposure. No significant pulmonary or cardiovascular changes were noted at
      low and middle dose levels. However, the high dose caused significant increases
      in breathing rate, pulmonary inflammation, and lung cell injury. Results suggest 
      that occasional consumer use of this antimicrobial spray product should not be a 
      hazard. However, extended exposure of workers routinely applying this product to 
      surfaces should be avoided. During application, care should be taken to minimize 
      exposure by working under well ventilated conditions and by employing respiratory
      protection as needed. It would be prudent to avoid exposure to children or those 
      with pre-existing respiratory disease.

TI  - Utilization of paediatric isolation facilities in a TB-endemic setting.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/s13756-015-0078-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In hospital settings, patient isolation is used to limit
      transmission of certain pathogens (e.g. M. tuberculosis [TB],
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses causing respiratory and enteric
      infection). Data is lacking on utilization of paediatric isolation facilities in 
      low-resource, TB-endemic settings. METHODS: Prospective weekday observation of 18
      paediatric isolation rooms at Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South
      Africa, was conducted between 1 May 2014 and 31 October 2014 documenting:
      occupancy rate; indication for isolation; duration of isolation; application of
      transmission-based precautions and infection prevention (IPC) behaviour of
      personnel. Potential under-utilization of isolation rooms was determined by
      cross-referencing isolation room occupancy with laboratory isolates of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria, M. tuberculosis and selected viral pathogens.
      RESULTS: Six percent (335/5906) of hospitalized children were isolated: 78 %
      (260/335) for IPC purposes. Most IPC-isolated patients had community-acquired
      infections (213/260; 82 %), including tuberculosis (130/260; 50 %) and suspected 
      viral infections (75/260; 29 %). Children (median age 17 months [IQR 6-50]) spent
      4 days (IQR 2-8) in isolation. Isolation occupancy was 66 % (2172/3294 occupied
      bed days), but varied significantly by month. Laboratory data identified an
      additional 135 patients warranting isolation with 2054 extra bed-days required.
      Forty patients with 171 patient days of inappropriate isolation were identified. 
      During 1223 weekday visits to IPC-isolated patient rooms: alcohol-based handrub
      was available (89 %); transmission-based precautions were appropriately
      implemented (71 %); and personal protective equipment was provided (74 %). Of 358
      observed interactions between paediatric staff and isolated patients, hand
      hygiene compliance was 65 % and adherence to transmission-based precautions was
      58 %. CONCLUSION: Patients isolated for TB (under airborne precautions) accounted
      for more than half of all isolation episodes. Missed opportunities for patient
      isolation were common but could be reduced by implementation of syndromic
      isolation. Demand for isolation facilities was seasonal, with projected demand
      exceeding available isolation beds over winter months.

AB  - Cold atmospheric plasma inactivates bacteria through reactive species produced
      from the applied gas. The use of cold plasma clinically has gained recent
      interest, as the need for alternative or supplementary strategies are necessary
      for preventing multi-drug resistant infections. The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of a novel shielded sliding discharge based
      cold plasma reactor operated by nanosecond voltage pulses in atmospheric air on
      both biotic and inanimate surfaces. Bacterial inactivation was determined by
      direct quantification of colony forming units. The plasma activated air
      (afterglow) was bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
      epidermidis seeded on culture media, laminate, and linoleum vinyl. In general, E.
      coli was more susceptible to plasma exposure. A bacterial reduction was observed 
      with the application of air alone on a laminate surface. Whole-cell real-time PCR
      revealed a decrease in the presence of E. coli genomic DNA on exposed samples.
      These findings suggest that plasma-induced bacterial inactivation is
      surface-dependent.

TI  - Intravitreal Ampicillin Sodium for Antibiotic-Resistant Endophthalmitis:
      Streptococcus uberis First Human Intraocular Infection Report.
LID - 10.1155/2010/169739 [doi]
LID - 169739 [pii]
AB  - Purpose. To describe the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment with 
      intravitreal ampicillin sodium of a postoperative endophthalmitis case due to
      Streptococcus uberis; an environmental pathogen commonly seen in mastitis cases
      of lactating cows. Methods. Case Report. A 52-year-old, Hispanic diabetic patient
      who suddenly developed severe pain and severe loss of vision, following
      vitrectomy. Results. The patient was diagnosed with postoperative endophthalmitis
      secondary to a highly resistant strain of Streptococcus uberis that did not
      respond to intravitreal antibiotics. He was treated with an air-fluid
      interchange, anterior chamber washout, intravitreal ampicillin sodium (5 mg/0.1
      mL), and silicon oil tamponade (5000 ck). The eye was anatomically stabilized,
      though there was no functional recovery. Conclusion. Streptococcus uberis is an
      uncommon pathogen to the human eye, which has unique features that help the
      strain in developing resistance to antibiotics. While treatment with intravitreal
      ampicillin is feasible, there are still concerns about its possible toxicity.

TI  - Differential growth of wrinkled biofilms.
PG  - 022710
AB  - Biofilms are antibiotic-resistant bacterial aggregates that grow on moist
      surfaces and can trigger hospital-acquired infections. They provide a classical
      example in biology where the dynamics of cellular communities may be observed and
      studied. Gene expression regulates cell division and differentiation, which
      affect the biofilm architecture. Mechanical and chemical processes shape the
      resulting structure. We gain insight into the interplay between cellular and
      mechanical processes during biofilm development on air-agar interfaces by means
      of a hybrid model. Cellular behavior is governed by stochastic rules informed by 
      a cascade of concentration fields for nutrients, waste, and autoinducers.
      Cellular differentiation and death alter the structure and the mechanical
      properties of the biofilm, which is deformed according to Foppl-Von Karman
      equations informed by cellular processes and the interaction with the substratum.
      Stiffness gradients due to growth and swelling produce wrinkle branching. We are 
      able to reproduce wrinkled structures often formed by biofilms on air-agar
      interfaces, as well as spatial distributions of differentiated cells commonly
      observed with B. subtilis.

TI  - The global spread of healthcare-associated multidrug-resistant bacteria: a
      perspective from Asia.
PG  - 1310-8
LID - 10.1093/cid/cit020 [doi]
AB  - Since antibiotics were first used, each new introduced class has been followed by
      a global wave of emergent resistance, largely originating in Europe and North
      America where they were first used. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      spread from the United Kingdom and North America across Europe and then Asia over
      more than a decade. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae followed a similar path some 20 years
      later. Recently however, metallo-beta-lactamases have originated in Asia. New
      Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 was found in almost every continent within a year 
      of its emergence in India. Metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes are encoded on highly
      transmissible plasmids that spread rapidly between bacteria, rather than relying 
      on clonal proliferation. Global air travel may have helped facilitate rapid
      dissemination. As the antibiotic pipeline offers little in the short term, our
      most important tools against the spread of antibiotic resistant organisms are
      intensified infection control, surveillance, and antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  - Novel intercellular communication system in Escherichia coli that confers
      antibiotic resistance between physically separated populations.
PG  - 1116-22
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether intercellular signalling can occur between physically 
      separated populations of Escherichia coli. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intercellular
      signalling between physically discrete populations of E. coli BL21 was analysed
      in bi-partite Petri dishes. Transfer of a growth-promoting signal resulted in
      induction of resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. Optimal expression of the
      signal occurred when the signalling population was established as a bacterial
      lawn for 24 h. This represented an entry into the stationary phase of growth, as 
      indicated by the expression profile of the RNA polymerase subunit sigma38
      (sigmaS; sigma S). The growth-promoting effect was also observed when E. coli
      DH5alpha (luxS-) was used as the signalling population. Preventing passage of air
      between the two populations resulted in a complete cessation of the
      growth-promoting effect. CONCLUSIONS: A growth-promoting signal occurs between
      physically separated cultures of E. coli. The exact nature of the signal remains 
      to be determined but does not involve the production of autoinducer-2 from the
      luxS gene. Signal transmission is likely to involve airborne transfer of a signal
      species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Intercellular signalling systems
      exist in bacteria that enable antibiotic resistance to be conferred between
      physically separated populations.

TI  - [Infection control to prevent tuberculosis in relation to resistance to
      antibiotics].
PG  - 880-3
AB  - Infection control differs among nations. Notably in USA strict measures are
      enforced to prevent air-borne tuberculosis (TB) transmission. In several European
      countries focus is on droplet transmission, close to patients. In the absence of 
      strict evidence to resolve this divergence, an empiric, Danish guideline for
      infection control in hospitals is presented. If multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is 
      documented or suspected, according to risk-factors, patients should remain under 
      air-borne precautions. The vast majority of Danish TB-patients (non-MDR) require 
      less demanding, hygienic precautions.

TI  - Airborne multidrug-resistant bacteria isolated from a concentrated swine feeding 
      operation.
PG  - 137-42
AB  - The use of nontherapeutic levels of antibiotics in swine production can select
      for antibiotic resistance in commensal and pathogenic bacteria in swine. As a
      result, retail pork products, as well as surface and groundwaters contaminated
      with swine waste, have been shown to be sources of human exposure to
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, it is unclear whether the air within
      swine operations also serves as a source of exposure to antibiotic-resistant
      bacterial pathogens. To investigate this issue, we sampled the air within a
      concentrated swine feeding operation with an all-glass impinger. Samples were
      analyzed using a method for the isolation of Enterococcus. A total of 137
      presumptive Enterococcus isolates were identified to species level using standard
      biochemical tests and analyzed for resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin,
      virginiamycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin using the agar dilution method.
      Thirty-four percent of the isolates were confirmed as Enterococcus, 32% were
      identified as coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 33% were identified as
      viridans group streptococci. Regardless of bacterial species, 98% of the isolates
      expressed high-level resistance to at least two antibiotics commonly used in
      swine production. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, an
      antibiotic that has never been approved for use in livestock in the United
      States. In conclusion, high-level multidrug-resistant Enterococcus,
      coagulase-negative staphylococci, and viridans group streptococci were detected
      in the air of a concentrated swine feeding operation. These findings suggest that
      the inhalation of air from these facilities may serve as an exposure pathway for 
      the transfer of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens from swine to humans.

AB  - The dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) from food-producing animals to the surrounding
      environment has attracted much attention. To determine the emissions of
      ESBL-producing E. coli from pig farms to the surrounding environment, fecal and
      environmental samples from six pig farms were collected. In total, 119
      ESBL-producing E. coli were isolated from feces, air samples, water, sludge and
      soil samples. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that the ESBL-producing
      isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics and isolates of different origin 
      within the same farm showed similar resistance phenotypes. Both CTX-M and TEM
      ESBL-encoding genes were detected in these isolates. CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 were
      the predominant ESBL genes identified. ESBL producers from feces and
      environmental samples within the same farm carried similar CTX-M types. The
      results indicated that the ESBL-producing E. coli carrying multidrug resistance
      could readily disseminate to the surrounding environment.

TI  - Operating theatre quality and prevention of surgical site infections.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - Surgical site infections (SSI) account for 14% to 17% of all hospital-acquired
      infections and 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSI remain a
      substantial cause of morbidity and death, possibly because of the larger numbers 
      of elderly surgical patients or those with a variety of chronic and
      immunocompromising conditions, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant
      microorganisms. Factors causing surgical site infection are multifarious. Several
      studies have identified the main patient-related (endogenous risk factors) and
      procedure-related (external risk factors) factors that influence the risk of SSI.
      The rate of surgical wound infections is strongly influenced by operating theatre
      quality, too. A safe and salubrious operating theatre is an environment in which 
      all sources of pollution and any micro-environmental alterations are kept
      strictly under control. This can be achieved only through careful planning,
      maintenance and periodic checks, as well as proper ongoing training for staff
      Many international scientific societies have produced guidelines regarding the
      environmental features of operating theatres (positive pressure, exchanges of
      filtered air per hour, air-conditioning systems with HEPA filters, etc.) and
      issued recommendations on healthcare-associated infection, including SSI,
      concerning surveillance methods, intervention to actively prevent SSI and
      approaches to monitoring the implementation of such strategies. Therefore, the
      prevention of SSI requires a multidisciplinary approach and the commitment of all
      concerned, including that of those who are responsible for the design, layout and
      functioning of operating theatres.

TI  - Penetration of erythromycin through Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm.
PG  - 2647-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: The catheter related infection caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis
      biofilm is increasing and difficult to treat by antimicrobial chemotherapy. The
      properties of biofilms that give rise to antibiotic resistance are only partially
      understood. This study aimed to elucidate the penetration of erythromycin through
      Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm. METHODS: The penetration ratio of
      erythromycin through Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms of 1457, 1457-msrA, and 
      wild isolate S68 was detected by biofilm penetration model at different time
      points according to the standard regression curve. The RNA/DNA ratio and the cell
      density within the biofilms were observed by confocal laser microscope and
      transmission electromicroscope, respectively. RESULTS: The penetration ratios of 
      erythromycin through the biofilms of 1457, 1457-msrA, and S68 after cultivation
      for 36 hours were 0.93, 0.55 and 0.4, respectively. The erythromycin penetration 
      ratio through 1457 biofilm (0.58 after 8 hours) was higher than that through the 
      other two (0.499 and 0.31 after 24 hours). Lower growth rate of the cells in
      biofilm was shown, with reduction of RNA/DNA proportion observed by confocal
      laser microscope through acridine orange stain. Compared with the control group
      observed by transmission electrmicroscope, the cell density of biofilm air face
      was lower than that of agar face, with more cell debris. CONCLUSIONS:
      Erythromycin could penetrate to the Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm, but could
      not kill the cells thoroughly. The lower growth rate of the cells within biofilm 
      could help decreasing the erythromycin susceptibility.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae isolated from pigs
      in Southern Japan with a modified agar dilution method.
PG  - 643-5
AB  - The determination of antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in
      Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae by using the agar dilution method has not been
      covered by the Clinical and Laboratory Institute (CLSI). Only the broth
      microdilution method has been outlined. This report describes a modification of
      the agar dilution procedure for E. rhusiopathiae using Trypto-soy agar
      supplemented with 0.1% Tween 80 and incubation in ambient air at 37 degrees C for
      24 hr. The MICs of the assay were in agreement with those of the broth
      microdilution method recommended by the CLSI. Antimicrobial susceptibility test
      was performed using this method for 149 E. rhusiopathiae isolates from 2 meat
      processing plants in Kagoshima Prefecture during the period of April 2004 to
      March 2005. The number of strains resistant to oxytetracycline, erythromycin,
      lincomycin, ofloxacin and enrofloxacin were 56 (37.6%), 4 (2.7%), 18 (12.1%), 21 
      (14.1%) and 19 (12.8%), respectively. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin.

TI  - Monitoring airborne biotic contaminants in the indoor environment of pig and

PG  - 1420-31

AB  - Given the growing concerns over human and animal health issues related to
      confined animal feeding operations, an in-depth examination is required to
      monitor for airborne bacteria and associated antibiotic resistance genes. Our 16S
      rRNA-based pyrosequencing revealed that the airborne microbial community skewed
      towards a higher abundance of Firmicutes (> 59.2%) and Bacteroidetes (4.2-31.4%) 
      within the confinement buildings, while the office environment was predominated
      by Proteobacteria (55.2%). Furthermore, bioaerosols in the confinement buildings 
      were sporadically associated with genera of potential pathogens, and these genera
      were more frequently observed in the bioaerosols of pig and layer hen confinement
      than the turkey confinement buildings and office environment. High abundances of 
      tetracycline resistance genes (9.55 x 10(2) to 1.69 x 10(6) copies ng(-1) DNA)
      were also detected in the bioaerosols sampled from confinement buildings.
      Bacterial lineages present in the poultry bioaerosols clustered apart from those 
      present in the pig bioaerosols and among the different phases of pig production, 
      suggesting that different livestock as well as production phase were associated
      with a distinct airborne microbial community. By understanding the diversity of
      biotic contaminants associated with the different confinement buildings, this
      study facilitates the implementation of better management strategies to minimize 
      potential health impacts on both livestock and humans working in this
      environment.

AB  - To establish a possible role for the natural environment in the transmission of
      clinically relevant AMR bacteria to humans, a literature review was conducted to 
      systematically collect and categorize evidence for human exposure to
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant
      Enterococcus spp. in the environment. In total, 239 datasets adhered to inclusion
      criteria. AMR bacteria were detected at exposure-relevant sites (35/38),
      including recreational areas, drinking water, ambient air, and shellfish, and in 
      fresh produce (8/16). More datasets were available for environmental compartments
      (139/157), including wildlife, water, soil, and air/dust. Quantitative data from 
      exposure-relevant sites (6/35) and environmental compartments (11/139) were
      scarce. AMR bacteria were detected in the contamination sources (66/66)
      wastewater and manure, and molecular data supporting their transmission from
      wastewater to the environment (1/66) were found. The abundance of AMR bacteria at
      exposure-relevant sites suggests risk for human exposure. Of publications
      pertaining to both environmental and human isolates, however, only one compared
      isolates from samples that had a clear spatial and temporal relationship, and no 
      direct evidence was found for transmission to humans through the environment. To 
      what extent the environment, compared to the clinical and veterinary domains,
      contributes to human exposure needs to be quantified. AMR bacteria in the
      environment, including sites relevant for human exposure, originate from
      contamination sources. Intervention strategies targeted at these sources could
      therefore limit emission of AMR bacteria to the environment.

AB  - Biofilms are surface-associated bacterial aggregates, in which bacteria are
      enveloped by polymeric substances known as the biofilm matrix. Bacillus subtilis 
      biofilms display persistent resistance to liquid wetting and gas penetration,
      which probably explains the broad-spectrum resistance of the bacteria in these
      biofilms to antimicrobial agents. In this study, BslA (formerly YuaB) was
      identified as a major contributor to the surface repellency of B. subtilis
      biofilms. Disruption of bslA resulted in the loss of surface repellency and
      altered the biofilm surface microstructure. BslA localized to the biofilm matrix 
      in an exopolysaccharide-dependent manner. Purified BslA exhibited amphiphilic
      properties and formed polymers in response to increases in the area of the
      air-water interface in vitro. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that the
      self-polymerization activity of BslA was essential for its ability to localize to
      the biofilm matrix. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that BslA formed a 
      layer on the biofilm surface. Taken together, we propose that BslA, standing for 
      biofilm-surface layer protein, is responsible for the hydrophobic layer on the
      surface of biofilms.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) causes both acute and chronic infections in
      humans characterized by tolerance to antibiotics and reactivation to cause
      secondary tuberculosis. These characteristics have led to renewed interest in the
      in vitro pellicle, or biofilm mode of growth, where bacteria grow to produce a
      thick aggregate at the air-liquid interface and exhibit increased phenotypic
      resistance to antibiotics. We infected guinea pigs with the virulent H37Rv strain
      of MTB for 60 days at which point we collected blood. To identify antigenic
      proteins, membrane protein extracts of MTB H37Ra pellicles and shaken cultures
      grown for 3, 5, or 7 weeks were probed with the infected animals' sera after the 
      proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). Antigenic 
      proteins were then identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry peptide mass 
      fingerprinting. Antigenic pellicle proteins were compared across the three
      timepoints to identify those that were produced consistently during pellicle
      growth. They were also compared to those membrane proteins identified from
      harvested shaken cultures to determine pellicle-specific vs. universally
      expressed proteins. Using this technique, we identified 44 distinct antigenic
      proteins, nine of which were pellicle-specific. The sequence of antigenic
      pellicle-specific proteins was checked for sequence conservation across 15
      sequenced MTB clinical isolates, three other members of the MTB complex, as well 
      as M. avium and M. smegmatis. The antigenic pellicle-specific protein Rv0097 was 
      found to have very high sequence conservation within the MTB complex but not with
      related mycobacteria, while FabG4 was highly conserved in all mycobacteria
      analyzed. These conserved pellicle-specific proteins represent targets for the
      development of future diagnostic tests and vaccines.

PG  - 395-405
AB  - Glycopeptides produced by Streptomyces species are the drugs used against
      beta-lactam drug-resistant staphylococcal infections, and vancomycin is important
      among them. Increased prevalence of resistant strains increased the usage of
      vancomycin worldwide and also promoted attempts for indigenous production. The
      optimum process conditions pH, temperature, inoculum size, agitation, and
      aeration for vancomycin production by Amycolatopsis orientalis were evaluated,
      statistically analyzed, and the response surface curves were constructed. The
      optimum process conditions were a pH of 7.6, a temperature of 29 degrees C, an
      inoculum size of 4.5%, an agitation of 255 rpm, and an aeration of less than 1:10
      medium-to-air ratio.

      Staphylococcus aureus infection in rats via reducing pulmonary natural killer
      cells.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between exposure to fine
      particular matter (PM2.5) and increased respiratory infection, but the mechanisms
      have remained poorly defined. By using an experimental system we evaluated the
      effect of PM2.5 exposure on susceptibility to subsequent pulmonary Staphylococcus
      aureus (S. aureus) infection and its potential mechanisms. Rats were
      intratracheally instilled with a single dose of PM2.5 sample or PBS followed by
      an intratracheal inoculation with bacteria S. aureus at 24h after PM2.5 exposure.
      The rats were examined at 24h post infection. We found that exposure of rats to
      PM2.5 significantly increased inflammatory cells and levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha
      in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). Prior PM2.5 exposure markedly increased 
      the susceptibility of rats to subsequent S. aureus infection. The mechanistic
      studies showed that alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PM2.5-experienced lungs had
      depressed phagocytosis of S. aureus, and prior PM2.5 exposure significantly
      decreased the natural killer (NK) cells recruited into the airways following
      subsequent S. aureus infection. Further, adoptive transfer of naive NK cells to
      the lung of prior PM2.5-exposed rats restored PM2.5-impaired antibacterial host
      defense. The presence of NK cells markedly enhanced the ability of AMs to
      phagocytose S. aureus ex vivo. Thus, our study identifies PM2.5-impaired NK cell 
      response in the lung to be a novel critical mechanism for PM2.5-mediated
      susceptibility to S. aureus bacterial infection, which provides a potential
      mechanism to explain the epidemiological findings that associate ambient air
      pollution and increased lung bacterial infections. Our findings also suggest that
      enhancing pulmonary NK cells may be considered for future therapeutic approaches 
      to clinically antibiotic-resistant S. aureus infection in the lung.

AB  - A mouse model of localized candidosis in air-filled subcutaneous cysts imitating 
      thrush has been developed. We have now tested various antifungal combinations in 
      this animal model. Flucytosine (5-FC) + amphotericin B (Amph B) showed the
      highest efficacy, a clear additive or even synergistic effect was seen. The
      combination of 5-FC + imidazole or triazole derivative was less efficacious, an
      additive effect was rare. The combination of 5-FC + Amph B was also tested
      against Candida albicans strains showing various degrees of 5-FC-resistance. A
      significant reduction in 5-FC-resistant mutants was seen after the treatment with
      the combination.

TI  - Prevention of periprosthetic joint infection: what are the effective strategies?
PG  - 251-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1376332 [doi]
AB  - Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty is a major
      burden for patients and health systems. Prevention of this challenging
      complication through implementation of effective strategies should be a priority.
      These strategies should encompass various levels of patient care. Multiple
      modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled hyperglycemia, obesity, smoking,
      substance abuse, and nasal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus have been
      described for PJI. Preoperative recognition and mitigation of these risk factors 
      along with optimization of nonmodifiable risk factors such as kidney, liver, or
      immune system insufficiency can considerably decrease the risk of PJI. A
      comprehensive perioperative protocol should involve optimization of the operative
      environment to reduce the number of bacteria and particulates in the air. Several
      surgical and nonsurgical details of intraoperative care such as maintenance of
      normothermia, skin preparation, surgical field irrigation, wound closure, and
      duration of surgical and anesthetic procedure can influence the occurrence of
      PJI. Prophylactic perioperative antibiotic administration is probably one of the 
      most important strategies in preventing PJI. Implementation of surgical safety
      checklist can diminish the risk of perioperative complications, particularly
      surgical site infection. Controversy regarding efficacy, efficiency, and
      optimization of some preventive measures continues to exist due to inconsistency 
      or inadequacy of available evidence. Novel research has focused on designing
      PJI-resistant implants and developing vaccines that target molecule components
      with major role in the process of bacterial adhesion to the implant or
      periprosthetic tissues.

AB  - AIMS: To assess antibiotic resistance in airborne bacteria associated with coarse
      particulate matter (PM10) in an urban area, with specific considerations about
      the Staphylococcus genus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Disc diffusion test was performed 
      on 243 microbial strains, isolated from PM10 in winter and summer and belonging
      to families Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and genera Acinetobacter,
      Enterococcus and Staphylococcus. Staphylococci resistances were the most
      heterogeneous, being distributed among almost all tested antibiotics.
      Staphylococcus isolates resistant to some selected antibiotics were further
      investigated for the presence of the corresponding genetic determinants. Only
      tetK, which mediates the tetracycline resistance through the action of an efflux 
      protein, was found in almost all resistant isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of
      specific genetic determinants makes their transmission among staphylococci less
      likely. This may reduce the theoretical risk associated with the inhalation of
      airborne micro-organisms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Although the
      spreading of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms is of particular concern in
      clinical settings, the origin of antibiotic resistance genes can be traced in
      natural environments. As behaviour, viability and transport of bacteria in the
      atmospheric compartment suffer from a lack of information, the evaluation of the 
      actual risk posed by airborne micro-organisms to human health is still
      challenging.

PG  - 16-20
AB  - This paper deals with so-called "indicator germs" in the air of stables, such as 
      Micrococci, E. coli and Pasteurella species. It is pointed out, that mostly the
      sources of these germs are the animals themselves. Studying the sources of
      airborne bacteria our working group found a close correlation between applicated 
      antibiotics (Chloramphenicol) and the resistance of airborne bacteria against
      this antibiotic. Spreading models lead to the conclusion that about 250-500 m
      around a stable there is a region of higher contamination by dust and infectious 
      risk is increased.

      biofilm reduction, which is highly resistant to antibiotics. This study was thus 
      an initial assessment of the antibacterial activity of two new quinoline
      derivatives of a structure of 3-thioacyl 1-methyl 4-arylaminoquinolinium salts
      against coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from a hospital
      environment, in a form of both biofilms and in planktonic form. Thirty-three
      stains of CoNS isolated from the hospital environment (air, surfaces) and seven
      reference strains from the ATCC collection were selected for the study. The mean 
      MIC value for 1-methyl-3-benzoylthio-4-(4-chlorophenylamino)quinolinum chloride
      (4-chlorophenylamino derivative) was 42.60 +/- 19.91 mug/mL, and in the case of
      strains subjected to 1-methyl-3-benzoylthio-4-(4-fluorophenylamino)quinolinum
      chloride (4-fluorophenylamino derivative) activity, the mean MIC value was 43.20 
      +/- 14.30 mug/mL. The mean concentration of 4-chlorophenylamino derivative that
      inhibited biofilm formation was 86.18 +/- 30.64 mug/mL. The mean concentration of
      4-fluorophenylamino derivatives that inhibited biofilm formation was higher and
      amounted to 237.09 +/- 160.57 mug/mL. Based on the results, both derivatives of
      the examined compounds exhibit high antimicrobial activity towards strains
      growing both in planktonic and biofilm form.

TI  - Arctic actinomycetes as potential inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae biofilm.
PG  - 338-42
LID - 10.1007/s00284-011-0073-4 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify novel biofilm inhibitors from actinomycetes
      isolated from the Arctic against Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera.
      The biofilm inhibitory activity of actinomycetes was assessed using biofilm assay
      and was confirmed using air-liquid interphase coverslip assay. The potential
      isolates were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of all, three isolates
      showed significant biofilm inhibition against V. cholerae. The results showed
      that 20% of the actinomycetes culture supernatant could inhibit up to 80% of the 
      biofilm formation. When different extracted fractions were assessed, significant 
      biofilm inhibition activity was only seen in the diethyl ether fraction of A745. 
      At 200 mug ml(-1) of diethyl ether fraction, 60% inhibition of V. cholerae
      biofilm was observed. The two potential isolates were found to be Streptomyces
      sp. and one isolate belonged to Nocardiopsis sp. This is the first report showing
      a Streptomyces sp. and Nocardiopsis sp. isolated from the Arctic having a biofilm
      inhibitory activity against V. cholerae. The spread of drug resistant V. cholerae
      strains is a major clinical problem and the ineffectiveness in antibiotic
      treatment necessitates finding new modes of prevention and containment of the
      disease, cholera. The formation of biofilms during the proliferation of V.
      cholerae is linked to its pathogenesis. Hence, the bioactive compound from the
      culture supernatant of the isolates identified in this study may be a promising
      source for the development of a potential quorum sensing inhibitors against V.
      cholerae.

AB  - AIMS: Multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens are clinically significant and 
      require the development of new antimicrobial methods. In this study,
      Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus cells
      were exposed to atmospheric plasma on agar plates and in vitro on porcine skin
      for the purpose of testing bacterial inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbial
      inactivation at varying exposure durations was tested using a nonthermal plasma
      jet generated with a DC voltage from ambient air. The observed reduction in
      colony forming units was quantified as log(10) reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Direct
      plasma exposure significantly inactivated seeded bacterial cells by approx. 6
      log(10) on agar plates and 2-3 log(10) on porcine skin. On agar plates, an
      indirect 'bystander' inactivation outside the plasma delivery area was also
      observed. The reduced inactivation observed on the skin surface was most likely
      due to cell protection by the variable surface architecture. SIGNIFICANCE AND
      IMPACT OF STUDY: Atmospheric plasma has potential for clinical application as a
      disinfectant of patient skin and medically relevant surfaces.

AB  - Two different binder materials of varying water affinity, viz. poly vinyl alcohol
      (PVA) and poly-tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and biocide vanillin were tested for
      cathode fouling in a single chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC)
      constructed with a low-cost baked clayware cylinder and operated under fed-batch 
      mode. PVA and PTFE loadings of 0.5 mg/cm(2) were used for MFC-1 and MFC-2,
      respectively as a binder; and a 1:1 mixture of PVA + PTFE was used as binder in
      MFC-3 with same binder loading. Vanillin was mixed with PVA and also applied at a
      loading of 0.5 mg/cm(2) for MFC-4. Results showed organic matter removal
      efficiencies around 90% for all MFCs both before and after fouling. Coulombic
      efficiency was, however, found to decrease 50% after fouling in the MFC-3 coated 
      with both PVA and PTFE. After 5 weeks of operation, due to fouling 56, 40 and 69%
      reduction in power densities were observed in MFC-1, MFC-2 and MFC-3,
      respectively. In the MFC-4 having PVA and vanillin, the least fouling was
      observed. A consistent volumetric power of 233 mW/m(3) was observed for MFC-4,
      thus potentially offering a suitable solution to alleviate the problem of fouling
      in the making of single-chamber air-cathode MFCs.

TI  - Reduction of Legionella spp. in water and in soil by a citrus plant extract
      vapor.
PG  - 6031-6
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01275-14 [doi]
AB  - Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella spp.,
      organisms often isolated from environmental sources, including soil and water.
      Legionella spp. are capable of replicating intracellularly within free-living
      protozoa, and once this has occurred, Legionella is particularly resistant to
      disinfectants. Citrus essential oil (EO) vapors are effective antimicrobials
      against a range of microorganisms, with reductions of 5 log cells ml(-1) on a
      variety of surfaces. The aim of this investigation was to assess the efficacy of 
      a citrus EO vapor against Legionella spp. in water and in soil systems.
      Reductions of viable cells of Legionella pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae,
      Legionella bozemanii, and an intra-amoebal culture of Legionella pneumophila
      (water system only) were assessed in soil and in water after exposure to a citrus
      EO vapor at concentrations ranging from 3.75 mg/liter air to 15g/liter air.
      Antimicrobial efficacy via different delivery systems (passive and active
      sintering of the vapor) was determined in water, and gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the antimicrobial components (linalool, citral, 
      and beta-pinene) was conducted. There was up to a 5-log cells ml(-1) reduction in
      Legionella spp. in soil after exposure to the citrus EO vapors (15 mg/liter air).
      The most susceptible strain in water was L. pneumophila, with a 4-log cells
      ml(-1) reduction after 24 h via sintering (15 g/liter air). Sintering the vapor
      through water increased the presence of the antimicrobial components, with a 61% 
      increase of linalool. Therefore, the appropriate method of delivery of an
      antimicrobial citrus EO vapor may go some way in controlling Legionella spp. from
      environmental sources.

LID - 10.1159/000346709 [doi]
AB  - To resist infections, robust defense mechanisms of the airways are essential.
      Retinoic acid promotes differentiation and maintains the phenotypic
      characteristics of bronchial epithelium. In addition, it induces the expression
      of the antibacterial growth factor midkine (MK). In the present study, we
      explored the expression and antibacterial activity of MK in an airway context. MK
      was detected in bronchial epithelial cells of large airways and type 2
      pneumocytes of normal lungs by immunohistochemistry. Immunoelectron microscopy
      revealed a surface-associated distribution, both on the ciliated apical and
      basolateral sides, and MK was detected in sputum obtained from healthy
      individuals by ELISA. In vitro, MK killed the common respiratory pathogen
      Streptococcus pneumoniae at below micromolar concentrations, an activity retained
      in the presence of sodium chloride at physiological concentrations. The MK
      molecule consists of two domains with three anti-parallel beta-sheets and a
      COOH-terminal tail. Although both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains alone showed
      antibacterial activity, the COOH-terminal domain including the tail region
      possessed higher bactericidal activity, i.e. in the order of the holoprotein.
      Retinoic acid-induced differentiation of primary bronchial epithelial cells,
      using an air-liquid interface system, revealed bactericidal activity in the
      apical airway surface liquid, an activity that was reduced after
      immunoprecipitation of MK. This study shows that airway epithelial cells of large
      airways and alveoli have a constitutive production of MK that is part of the
      bactericidal activity present in the air surface liquid, at least in vitro, and
      may thus be an important part of this arm of airway host defense.

AB  - Acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare disease because the thyroid gland is
      remarkably resistant to infection. We present a 2-year-old girl with refractory
      acute suppurative thyroiditis due to a pyriform sinus fistula (PSF). She
      complained of fever and painful anterior neck swelling. Her condition did not
      completely improved by multiple parenteral antibiotics along with incision and
      drainage. Barium esophagogram to detect PSF demonstrated no specific finding.
      Computed tomography scan showed air bubble superior to the left thyroid gland
      which indicated a possible fistula connected to the pyriform sinus. An
      intraoperative laryngoscopy revealed a 2-mm-sized fistula opening. The fistula
      was successfully treated by chemocauterization with trichloroacetic acid.

TI  - New methods to clean ICU rooms.
PG  - 365-75
AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) represent the most common adverse event in the
      intensive care unit (ICU). Their prevalence is high and they are associated with 
      increased morbidity and mortality. The environment plays a central role in the
      transmission of hospital-acquired pathogens (HAP) and in the pathogenesis of HAI.
      Many bacteria, especially multidrug resistant ones, can survive for several
      months in the hospital environment in particular in areas close to the patients. 
      It has been proven that pathogens are transmitted from the environment to the
      patients. Many studies have concluded that current cleaning methods are
      microbiologically ineffective. This failure concerns daily cleaning as well as
      terminal cleaning after patient discharge. It has been demonstrated that
      improvements in environmental cleaning are associated with a decrease in the rate
      of HAP and of HAI. New cleaning methods could enhance hospital cleaning
      efficiency. Three new technologies seem promising because they are
      microbiologically effective, easy and safe to use: (1) hydrogen peroxide vapor
      and (2) UV light decontamination are used for terminal cleaning. These techniques
      are effective even in difficultly accessible areas. (3) ultramicrofibers which
      can be associated with a copper-based biocide can be used for daily cleaning.
      Other methods such as ozone, steam or high-efficiency particulate air filtration 
      are not efficient enough to be considered serious contenders for the improvement 
      of the quality of the hospital environment. These new technologies have not been 
      yet linked to a decrease in the prevalence and the incidence in HAP and HAI. It
      remains difficult to justify the extra-cost associated with these new methods
      until more studies can confirm their effectiveness in the management of HAI.

TI  - Comparison of airborne bacterial communities from a hog farm and spray field.
PG  - 709-17
AB  - Airborne bacteria from hog farms may have detrimental impacts on human health,
      particularly in terms of antibiotic resistance and pathogen zoonosis. Despite
      human health risks, very little is known about the composition and diversity of
      airborne bacteria from hog farms and hog-related spray fields. We used
      pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes to compare airborne bacterial
      communities in a North Carolina hog farm and lagoon spray field. In addition, we 
      isolated and identified antibiotic-resistant bacteria from both air samples.
      Based on 16S rRNA gene pyrosequence analysis, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
      Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in airborne bacterial
      communities from both hog farm and spray field sites. Within the Firmicutes
      genera, Clostridium spp. were more abundant in the hog farm, whereas
      Staphylococcus spp. were higher in the spray field. The presence of opportunitic 
      pathogens, including several Staphylococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes, 
      was detected in both bioaerosol communities based on phylogenetic analysis. The
      isolation and identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from air samples
      also showed similar results with dominance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria
      in both hog farm and spray field air. Thus, the existence of opportunistic
      pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria in airborne communities evidences
      potential health risks to farmers and other residents from swine bioaerosol
      exposure.

AB  - The aim of our study was to recognize coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in
      the air of operating theatres. Out of the identification of 449 isolates, the
      most frequent species were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus
      haemolyticus. The strains were adherent to glass in 52.3%. Most of the S.
      epidermidis showed adherent growth, while the majority of the S. haemolyticus
      failed to adhere. The disk-diffusion antibiotic sensitivity tests showed great
      differences in sensitivity to penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin between
      adherence-positive and negative isolates. On the whole, the species S.
      haemolyticus proved to be much more resistant than S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus
      warneri was the most, while S. haemolyticus was the least sensitive to phages.

AB  - The antifungal efficacy of nerol (NEL) has been proved against Aspergillus flavus
      by using in vitro and in vivo tests. The mycelial growth of A. flavus was
      completely inhibited at concentrations of 0.8 mu L/mL and 0.1 mu L/mL NEL in the 
      air at contact and vapor conditions, respectively. The NEL also had an evident
      inhibitory effect on spore germination in A. flavus along with NEL concentration 
      as well as time-dependent kinetic inhibition. The NEL presented noticeable
      inhibition on dry mycelium weight and synthesis of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by A.
      flavus, totally restraining AFB1 production at 0.6 mu L/mL. In real food system, 
      the efficacy of the NEL on resistance to decay development in cherry tomatoes was
      investigated in vivo by exposing inoculated and control fruit groups to NEL vapor
      at different concentration. NEL vapors at 0.1 mu L/mL air concentration
      significantly reduced artificially contaminated A. flavus and a broad spectrum of
      fungal microbiota. Results obtained from presented study showed that the NEL had 
      a great antifungal activity and could be considered as a benefit and safe tool to
      control food spoilage.

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae with
      Cefotaximase-Munchen (CTX-M) enzymes are rapidly increasing worldwide and pose a 
      threat to health care. ESBLs with CTX-M enzymes have been isolated from animals
      and different food products, but it is unknown if food imported from the
      Mediterranean area may be a possible reservoir of these bacteria. During
      2007-2008, swab samples from food across different retail outlets (mostly food
      from the Mediterranean countries and Swedish chicken) were collected. Escherichia
      coli strains from Swedish meat and E. coli isolates from unspecified food from a 
      Swedish food testing laboratory were also examined. In 349 of the 419 swab
      samples, growth of Enterobacteriaceae was found. In most of the samples, there
      was also growth of Gram-negative environmental bacteria. Air dry-cured products
      contained significantly less Enterobacteriaceae isolates compared to lettuces;
      however, none of the examined Enterobacteriaceae harbored ESBLs. This study did
      not support the theory that imported food from the Mediterranean area or Swedish 
      domestic food might constitute an important vehicle for the dissemination of
      ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae; however, a spread from food to humans may have
      occurred after 2008.

TI  - Comparison of local and systemic ciprofloxacin ototoxicity in the treatment of
      chronic media otitis.
PG  - 144-9
LID - 10.5539/gjhs.v6n7p144 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic media otitis is a common cause of reference to ear, nose
      and throat clinics and the treatment is one of the health problems among ENT
      specialists. Ciprofloxacin drop that is of fluoroquinolone drug class due to good
      treatment effect is now widely used in the treatment of chronic media otitis. Due
      to the widespread use, it seems proper research on the human population has not
      been taken to ensure its non-toxicity in the inner ear, therefore comparison of
      local ciprofloxacin ototoxicity with systemic in chronic media otitis is
      investigated in this study. MATERIALS & METHODS: This study was conducted as a
      randomized clinical trial. Prospective methods were considered and the number of 
      samples in the study group was 40 patients that were treated with ciprofloxacin
      drops. And in the control group 32 patients with chronic media otitis who were
      treated with ciprofloxacin tablets. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS
      software. RESULTS: Statistical indicators of different frequencies in air
      conduction (AC) in both groups showed, there was significant improvement in
      hearing thresholds at frequencies of 250, 8000, 1000 in air conduction for the
      group receiving drops compared to the group receiving tablet. Based on
      statistical indicators in different frequencies of bone conduction in the two
      treated groups, there was significant difference in the two groups receiving
      tablets and drops only at a frequency of 4000 Hz that drop impact improves
      hearing threshold and in contrast in the group receiving tablet hearing loss was 
      seen in the frequency of 4000. DISCUSSION: Topical ciprofloxacin is a safe and
      uncomplicated ototoxic drug that is an effective antibiotic used in the treatment
      of refractory chronic otitis those dregs such as pseudomonas aerogenusa and
      staphylococci resistant to methicillin are responsible for it, which in the usual
      doses has not harmful effects on hearing hairy cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly transmissible genes encoding resistance to carbapenems have
      demonstrated global spread. The New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase 1 gene is
      hypothesized to have originated in India, with subsequent dissemination by
      colonized or infected travelers. METHOD: We conducted an ecological study
      evaluating the association between the cumulative air traffic departing India
      between 2007 and 2012 and published cases of NDM-1. Receiver operator
      characteristic curves were generated as well as multivariate logistic regression 
      models. 193 countries with complete flight and World Bank data were included in
      the analysis. RESULTS: Receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) of the
      dichotomous outcome of a published case of NDM-1 were generated, yielding an
      unadjusted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and adjusted AUC of 0.85. The
      unadjusted odds ratio of having a reported case of NDM-1, for every percentage
      increase in cumulative air traffic departing India, was 2.3 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.7)
      and adjusted was 2.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that flows 
      of international travelers departing India by air is associated with published
      NDM-1 cases, globally. Countries with high passenger flight traffic from India
      with no reported cases of NDM-1 may be at increased risk of having unreported
      transmission of NDM-1.

LID - 10.1186/s40794-016-0025-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health threat
      around the world and is not well characterized in the developing setting.
      Specifically, there is a lack of information regarding nasal colonization with S.
      aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Latin America
      and Peru. METHODS: This is the report of the baseline findings of a prospective
      cohort study followed up over 1 year at four geographically and ecologically
      distinct Peruvian Air Force bases in order to determine S. aureus nasal
      colonization prevalence and risk factors. Additionally, all MRSA isolates
      underwent molecular analysis which included pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and 
      determination of virulence and resistance genes. RESULTS: We enrolled 756
      military personnel. Anterior nares colonization with Staphylococcus aureus was
      detected in 73 of 756 participants (9.7 %) and MRSA was detected in 2 of 756 (0.3
      %). Colonization rates differed significantly (P = 0.02) between geographic
      enrollment sites: Talara-4.3 %, Iquitos-9.1 %, Arequipa-14.0 % and Lima-11.3 %.
      Risk factors for S. aureus colonization included being male and a reported
      history of respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: Overall, we found low prevalence of
      S. aureus and MRSA nasal colonization in this Peruvian military population. These
      findings contribute to the overall epidemiological understanding of S. aureus and
      MRSA in Latin America. The colonization rates which varied based on geographical 
      location warrants further study.

TI  - Inhaled therapeutics for prevention and treatment of pneumonia.
PG  - 435-49
LID - 10.1517/14740330903036083 [doi]
AB  - The lungs are the most common site of serious infection owing to their large
      surface area exposed to the external environment and minimum barrier defense.
      However, this architecture makes the lungs readily available for topical therapy.
      Therapeutic aerosols include those directed towards improving mucociliary
      clearance of pathogens, stimulation of innate resistance to microbial infection, 
      cytokine stimulation of immune function and delivery of antibiotics. In our
      opinion inhaled antimicrobials are underused, especially in patients with
      difficult-to-treat lung infections. The use of inhaled antimicrobial therapy has 
      become an important part of the treatment of airway infection with Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis and the prevention of invasive fungal infection in 
      patients undergoing heart and lung transplantation. Cytokine inhaled therapy has 
      also been explored in the treatment of neoplastic and infectious disease. The
      choice of pulmonary drug delivery systems remains critical as air-jet and
      ultrasonic nebulizer may deliver sub-optimum drug concentration if not used
      properly. In future development of this field, we recommend an emphasis on the
      study of the use of aerosolized hypertonic saline solution to reduce pathogen
      burden in the airways of subjects infected with microbes of low virulence,
      stimulation of innate resistance to prevent pneumonia in immunocompromised
      subjects using cytokines or synthetic pathogen-associated molecular pattern
      analogues and more opportunities for the use of inhaled antimicrobials. These
      therapeutics are still in their infancy but show great promise.

TI  - Catheter-related infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: virulence factors
      involved and their relationships.
PG  - 87-94
LID - 10.1111/2049-632X.12188 [doi]
AB  - The nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is equipped with a large arsenal
      of cell-associated and secreted virulence factors which enhance its invasive
      potential. The complex relationships among virulence determinants have hitherto
      not been fully elucidated. In the present study, 175 catheter-related isolates
      were observed for the presence of selected virulence factors, namely
      extracellular enzymes and siderophore production, biofilm formation, resistance
      to antibiotics, and motility. A high percentage of the strains produced most of
      the tested virulence factors. A positive correlation was identified between the
      production of several exoproducts, and also between the formation of both types
      of biofilm. An opposite trend was observed between the two types of biofilm and
      the production of siderophores. Whereas the relationship between the submerged
      biofilm production (i.e. the biofilm formed on the solid surface below the water 
      level) and the siderophore secretion was negative, the production of air-liquid
      interface (A-L) biofilm (i.e. the biofilm floating on the surface of the
      cultivation medium) and the siderophore secretion were positively correlated. All
      correlations were statistically significant at the level P = 0.05 with the
      correlation coefficient gamma >/= 0.50. Our results suggest that: (1) the
      co-production of the lytic enzymes and siderophores can play an important role in
      the pathogenesis of the catheter-related infections and should be taken into
      account when the virulence potential is assessed; (2) biofilm-positive strains
      are capable of forming both submerged and non-attached A-L biofilms; and (3) the 
      different micro-environment in the submerged biofilm and A-L biofilm layers have 
      opposite consequences for the production of other virulence factors.

AB  - The effects of bacterial masses upon the drug resistance of neighboring bacteria 
      were investigated. The experiments were performed with plastic Petri dishes
      divided into two identical compartments. A growing mass of Bacillus subtilis
      (signal emitter cell) in one compartment exerted enhancing effects upon the
      erythromycin and streptomycin resistance of Bacillus carboniphilus (signal
      recipient) cells, sparsely seeded in the other compartment, through the plastic
      wall and the air. These effects of the growing mass of cells are attributed to
      the emission of "sonic" signals.

LID - 10.1021/es400238g [doi]
AB  - Genes encoding tetracycline resistance and the integrase of Class 1 integrons
      were enumerated using quantitative PCR from aerosols collected from indoor and
      outdoor environments. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and
      human-occupied indoor environments (two clinics and a homeless shelter) were
      found to be a source of airborne tet(X) and tet(W) genes. The CAFOs had 10- to
      100-times higher concentrations of airborne 16S rRNA, tet(X), and tet(W) genes
      than other environments sampled, and increased concentrations of aerosolized
      bacteria correlated with increased concentrations of airborne resistance genes.
      The two CAFOs studied had statistically similar concentrations of resistance
      genes in their aerosol samples, even though antibiotic use was markedly different
      between the two operations. Additionally, tet(W) genes were recovered in outdoor 
      air within 2 km of livestock operations, which suggests that antibiotic
      resistance genes may be transported via aerosols on local scales. The integrase
      gene (intI1) from Class 1 integrons, which has been associated with multidrug
      resistance, was detected in CAFOs but not in human-occupied indoor environments, 
      suggesting that CAFO aerosols could serve as a reservoir of multidrug resistance.
      In conclusion, our results show that CAFOs and clinics are sources of aerosolized
      antibiotic resistance genes that can potentially be transported via air movement.

TI  - Escherichia coli in settled-dust and air samples collected in residential
      environments in Mexico City.
PG  - 4093-5
AB  - Escherichia coli, an important indicator of the presence of fecal material, was
      isolated from indoor and outdoor environments in Mexico City. The heterogeneity
      of E. coli was represented by 89 serotypes, most of them coming from settled-dust
      indoor samples; 21% of them presented antibiotic multiresistance. The numbers of 
      plasmids were higher among the antibiotic-resistant strains. The results of this 
      study suggest that intestinal infections produced by environmental strains could 
      be of more epidemiological impact than previously thought.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus triggers nitric oxide production in human upper airway
      epithelium.
PG  - 808-13
LID - 10.1002/alr.21568 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is an important antibacterial defense molecule
      produced by upper airway (sinonasal) epithelial cells. We previously showed that 
      a bitter taste receptor expressed in airway epithelium detects quorum-sensing
      molecules secreted by Gram-negative bacteria and subsequently triggers
      bactericidal NO production. We hypothesized that the upper airway epithelium may 
      also be able to detect the Gram-positive aerobe Staphylococcus aureus and mount
      an NO response. METHODS: Human sinonasal air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures were
      treated with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-conditioned medium (CM), and 
      NO production was measured using fluorescence imaging. Inhibitors of bitter taste
      receptor signaling were used to pharmacologically determine if this pathway was
      involved in the production of NO. RESULTS: A low-molecular-weight, heat, and
      protease-stabile product found in MRSA CM induced differential, NO synthase
      (NOS)-mediated NO production. This response varied markedly between individual
      patients. The MRSA-stimulated NO production was not dependent on 2 important
      components of bitter taste signaling: phospholipase C isoform beta-2 or the
      transient receptor potential melastatin isoform 5 (TRPM5) ion channel.
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that a S. aureus product elicits an NO-mediated
      innate defense response in human upper airway epithelium. The active bacterial
      product is likely a small, nonpeptide molecule that triggers a pathway
      independent of bitter taste receptors. Patient variation in the NO response to
      MRSA product(s), potentially due to genetic differences, might play a role in
      pathophysiology of Gram-positive upper respiratory infections and/or pathogenesis
      of chronic rhinosinusitis.

TI  - Survey of microbial contamination and characterization of Escherichia coli in
      kiwifruit orchards in Shaanxi, China, 2013.
PG  - 857-63
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2015.1967 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to survey three foodborne pathogens in kiwifruit
      orchards as a continuous monitoring program. A total of 193 samples were
      collected from 11 kiwifruit orchards in Shaanxi province in October 2013. Among
      the 193 samples, 68 Escherichia coli isolates were recovered, while no
      Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella was recovered. All E. coli isolates were
      characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of virulence
      genes, and the ability to produce biofilm formation. The isolates were further
      examined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. E. coli isolates
      displayed resistance most frequently to tetracycline (48.5%). Two E. coli
      isolates (2.9%) were positive for the eae gene (the intimin gene). All E. coli
      isolates lacked the ability to make biofilm formation. Multilocus sequence typing
      analysis demonstrated that one isolate in kiwifruit orchards shared the same
      sequence type with a human clinical isolate. RAPD results showed a close
      relationship among E. coli isolates from fresh fruit, fallen fruit, soil, air,
      and irrigation water. This study could provide a further understanding of
      microbial contamination in kiwifruit orchards based on our previous study and
      help growers take appropriate measures for prevention.

AB  - The study was conducted to investigate drug resistance, OXA-type
      carbapenemases-encoding genes and genetic diversity in airborne Acinetobacter
      baumannii (A. baumannii) in burn wards. Airborne A. baumannii were collected in
      burn wards and their corridors using Andersen 6-stage air sampler from January to
      June 2011. The isolates susceptibility to 13 commonly used antibiotics was
      examined according to the CLSI guidelines; OXA-type carbapenemases-encoding genes
      and molecular diversity of isolates were analyzed, respectively. A total of 16
      non-repetitive A. baumannii were isolated, with 10 strains having a resistance
      rate of greater than 50% against the 13 antibiotics. The resistance rate against 
      ceftriaxone, cyclophosvnamide, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem was 93.75% (15/16),
      but no isolate observed to be resistant to cefoperazone/sulbactam. Resistance
      gene analyses showed that all 16 isolates carried OXA-51, and 15 isolates carried
      OXA-23 except No.15; but OXA-24 and OXA-58 resistance genes not detected. The
      isolates were classified into 13 genotypes (A-M) according to repetitive
      extragenic palindromic sequence PCR (REP-PCR) results and only six isolates had a
      homology >/=90%. In conclusion, airborne A. baumannii in the burn wards had
      multidrug resistance and complex molecular diversity, and OXA-23 and OXA-51 were 
      dominant mechanisms for resisting carbapenems.

TI  - Air-borne microbial contamination of surfaces in a UK dental clinic.
PG  - 195-203
AB  - Little is known about the number, type, or antibiotic resistance profiles, of
      air-borne microbes present in hospital settings yet such information is important
      in designing effective measures to reduce cross-infection. In this study settle
      plates were used to identify and quantify the air-borne microbes present in a
      dental clinic. All isolates were identified to species level using partial 16S
      ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and their susceptibility to ampicillin,
      chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin, tetracycline or vancomycin
      was performed. The mean numbers of viable bacteria detected for each sampling
      occasion during periods of clinical activity and in the absence of such activity 
      were 21.9 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h and 2.3 x 10(2 )cfu/m2/h respectively. One hundred
      ninety-three distinct colony morphotypes, comprising 73 species, were isolated
      during the study and 48% of these were resistant to at least one antibiotic. The 
      mean numbers of different morphotypes detected per sampling occasion were 14.3
      and 5 during periods of clinical activity and inactivity respectively.
      Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were
      frequently isolated regardless of whether any clinical activities were taking
      place. These findings highlight the importance of preventing surfaces from
      becoming reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and thereby contributing to 
      cross-infection in the dental clinic.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Bilophila wadsworthia by using
      triphenyltetrazolium chloride to facilitate endpoint determination.
PG  - 1658-64
AB  - Initial susceptibility studies of Bilophila wadsworthia indicated significant
      resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem and cefoxitin. 
      NO beta-lactamase production was detected. However, some B. wadsworthia strains
      may grow as a heavy "haze" at up to the highest concentration of an antibiotic on
      standard antimicrobial agent-containing plates, and it is often difficult to
      determine the point at which conventional growth stops and haze growth begins. We
      investigated the nature of the haze growth of B. wadsworthia by using
      triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as an indicator of viability during
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, by determining viability counts on
      antimicrobial agent-containing plates at various times, and by microscopically
      inspecting stained preparations of the growth on the control plate and the haze
      area. TTC MICs were determined by applying a TTC solution over the growth on
      plates inside the anaerobic chamber or within 5 min after exposure to air
      (aerobic TTC MICs). The haze growth reduced TTC in the chamber but not under
      aerobic conditions, whereas TTC was reduced by the conventional growth in both
      atmospheres. The aerobic TTC MICs correlated with the viability counts. Separated
      proteins resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing 
      showed TTC-reactive bands only when stained under anaerobic conditions, further
      demonstrating the sensitivity of TTC reduction to aerobic conditions. Microscopic
      examination of the haze growth indicated spheroplast formation. A new antibiogram
      for B. wadsworthia has been established by use of aerobic TTC endpoints; we
      believe that the lower MICs obtained with the TTC method are likely the ones that
      are clinically relevant and should be used in tests of B. wadsworthia. Also, we
      found that when the organisms were grown on pyruvate-containing medium, 87% of 56
      strains tested were Beta-lactamase positive.

TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in human periodontitis.
PG  - 493-9
LID - 10.1111/jre.12031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Beta-lactam antibiotics prescribed in periodontal
      therapy are vulnerable to degradation by bacterial beta-lactamases. This study
      evaluated the occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacteria in
      chronic periodontitis subjects of USA origin, and assessed their in vitro
      resistance to metronidazole at a breakpoint concentration of 4 mug/mL. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens from deep periodontal pockets with
      bleeding on probing were removed from 564 adults with severe chronic
      periodontitis before treatment. The samples were transported in VMGA III and then
      plated onto: (i) nonselective enriched Brucella blood agar (EBBA) and incubated
      anaerobically for 7 d; and (ii) selective trypticase soy-bacitracin-vancomycin
      (TSBV) and incubated for 3 d in air + 5% CO2 . At the end of the incubation
      periods, the bacterial test species were identified and quantified. Specimen
      dilutions were also plated onto EBBA plates supplemented with 2 mug/mL of
      amoxicillin, a combination of 2 mug/mL of amoxicillin plus 2 mug/mL of the
      beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, or 4 mug/mL of metronidazole, followed 
      by anaerobic incubation for 7 d. Bacterial test species presumptively positive
      for beta-lactamase production were identified by growth on EBBA primary isolation
      plates supplemented with amoxicillin alone and no growth on EBBA primary
      isolation plates containing both amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. A subset of
      such isolates was subjected to nitrocefin-based chromogenic disk testing to
      confirm the presence of beta-lactamase activity. In vitro resistance to 4 mug/mL 
      of metronidazole was noted when growth of test species occurred on
      metronidazole-supplemented EBBA culture plates. RESULTS: Two-hundred and
      ninety-four (52.1%) of the study subjects yielded beta-lactamase-producing
      subgingival bacterial test species, with Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens,
      Fusobacterium nucleatum and other Prevotella species most frequently identified
      as beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Of the beta-lactamase-producing bacterial 
      test species strains recovered, 98.9% were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole 
      at 4 mug/mL. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival
      bacterial species in more than half of the subjects with severe chronic
      periodontitis raises questions about the therapeutic potential of single-drug
      regimens with beta-lactam antibiotics in periodontal therapy. The in vitro
      effectiveness of metronidazole against nearly all recovered
      beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial species further supports clinical 
      periodontitis treatment strategies involving the combination of systemic
      amoxicillin plus metronidazole.

TI  - Sterilizing a clinitron air-fluidized bed with colistine powder.
PG  - 245-6
AB  - After cross-patient infection occurred with the Clinitron bed, we looked for a
      way to deliver an antibiotic agent into the inner environment of the Clinitron
      bed through the filtering system in a manner that would sterilize the
      contaminated microspheres. Multiple cultures of the contaminated microspheres
      from the Clinitron air-fluidized bed were done, and the infecting microorganisms 
      were identified. The appropriate antibiotic powder was delivered through the
      filter system of the bed, and the microspheres were recultured after treatment.
      After an antibiotic powder was administered, the microspheres cultured were
      sterile. We found that the Clinitron bed can be safely, easily, and inexpensively
      sterilized and reused by the administration of antibiotic agent through the air
      filter system. Furthermore resistant bacteria can be treated with antibiotic
      agent sparingly used in a clinical setting because of toxicity.

TI  - [Successful Treatment of Empyema with Bronchial Fistulas by Filling under
      Thoracoscopic Observation; Report of a Case].
PG  - 1035-7
AB  - Empyema with fistula usually resists conservative treatment such as thoracic
      cavity drainage and administration of antibacterial agents, thus it often
      requires surgeries such as fenestration, omental/muscle filling, and
      thoracoplasty. However, due to advanced age and poor condition, conducting
      invasive surgeries is often difficult in elderly patients. We report a case with 
      the improvement of empyema by bronchial filling with endobronchial Watanabe
      spigot (EWS) under thoracoscopic observation for an 89-year-old patient who had
      developed chronic empyema with a bronchial fistulas. After filling EWS,
      air-leakage from bronchial fistula disappeared and the patient could discharged
      from the hospital successfully.

TI  - Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: prospective detection among community lower
      respiratory isolates in Eastern Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 139-44
AB  - Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae is a distinct pathogen and the available evidence 
      suggests its significance in lower respiratory tract infections. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate the occurrence of this new species in patients
      presenting with community-acquired pneumonia in a university hospital setting
      using routine laboratory tests. Sputum samples (n = 213) submitted to the
      microbiology laboratory for culture from cases clinically diagnosed as
      community-acquired pneumonia are studied. Optochin variability in ambient air and
      5% CO2 was the criterion used to identify S. pseudopneumoniae. Disc-diffusion and
      E-test on Muller Hinton blood-based agar were used for antibiotic susceptibility 
      testing following Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute breakpoints. Out of the 
      screened isolates, only six (3%) were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae. None of 
      the commercial tests differentiated the pathogens from viridans streptococci so
      diagnostic laboratories need to provide an alternative identification algorithm. 
      The six isolates showed susceptibility to penicillin, and five isolates were
      susceptible to vancomycin, but one exhibited low-level resistance (minimum
      inhibitory concentration [MIC]: 1 mug/mL). All isolates showed high-level
      resistance to macrolides (MIC: 24- > 256 mug/mL). Although S. pseudopneumoniae
      strains were not sufficiently frequent to justify routine additional incubation
      of sputum samples in ambient air, the high resistance pattern is alarming.
      Further surveillance is needed in diagnostic laboratories to understand the
      epidemiology and clinical significance of the newly described pathogen.

AB  - Exposure to the soil-borne pathogens Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia
      cenocepacia can lead to severe infections and even mortality. These pathogens
      exhibit a high resistance to antibiotic treatments. In addition, no licensed
      vaccine is currently available. A nanoscale platinum-containing titania
      photocatalyst (TiO(2)-Pt) has been shown to have a superior visible
      light-responsive photocatalytic ability to degrade chemical contaminants like
      nitrogen oxides. The antibacterial activity of the catalyst and its potential use
      in soil pathogen control were evaluated. Using the plating method, we found that 
      TiO(2)-Pt exerts superior antibacterial performance against Escherichia coli
      compared to other commercially available and laboratory prepared
      ultraviolet/visible light-responsive titania photocatalysts. TiO(2)-Pt-mediated
      photocatalysis also affectively eliminates the soil-borne bacteria B.
      pseudomallei and B. cenocepacia. An air pouch infection mouse model further
      revealed that TiO(2)-Pt-mediated photocatalysis could reduce the pathogenicity of
      both strains of bacteria. Unexpectedly, water containing up to 10% w/v dissolved 
      soil particles did not reduce the antibacterial potency of TiO(2)-Pt, suggesting 
      that the TiO(2)-Pt photocatalyst is suitable for use in soil-contaminated
      environments. The TiO(2)-Pt photocatalyst exerted superior antibacterial activity
      against a broad spectrum of human pathogens, including B. pseudomallei and B.
      cenocepacia. Soil particles (<10% w/v) did not significantly reduce the
      antibacterial activity of TiO(2)-Pt in water. These findings suggest that the
      TiO(2)-Pt photocatalyst may have potential applications in the development of
      bactericides for soil-borne pathogens.

TI  - Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infections in critically injured Canadian
      forces soldiers.
PG  - 95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Military members, injured in Afghanistan or Iraq, have returned home 
      with multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections. The source of these
      infections is unknown. METHODS: Retrospective study of all Canadian soldiers who 
      were injured in Afghanistan and who required mechanical ventilation from January 
      1 2006 to September 1 2006. Patients who developed A. baumannii ventilator
      associated pneumonia (VAP) were identified. All A. baumannii isolates were
      retrieved for study patients and compared with A. baumannii isolates from
      environmental sources from the Kandahar military hospital using pulsed-field gel 
      electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: During the study period, six Canadian Forces
      (CF) soldiers were injured in Afghanistan, required mechanical ventilation and
      were repatriated to Canadian hospitals. Four of these patients developed A.
      baumannii VAP. A. baumannii was also isolated from one environmental source in
      Kandahar - a ventilator air intake filter. Patient isolates were genetically
      indistinguishable from each other and from the isolates cultured from the
      ventilator filter. These isolates were resistant to numerous classes of
      antimicrobials including the carbapenems. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 
      the source of A. baumannii infection for these four patients was an environmental
      source in the military field hospital in Kandahar. A causal linkage, however, was
      not established with the ventilator. This study suggests that infection control
      efforts and further research should be focused on the military field hospital
      environment to prevent further multi-drug resistant A. baumannii infections in
      injured soldiers.

TI  - Anesthesia for the adult patient with an unrepaired congenital cyanotic heart
      defect: a case report.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - Adult congenital heart disease, previously considered a rare comorbidity, is
      increasingly becoming a reality for today's anesthesia providers. Improvements in
      prenatal diagnosis, sophisticated surgical techniques and equipment, advances in 
      pediatric critical care, enhanced efficacy of cardiovascular pharmacologic
      agents, and an overall increase in postrepair survival rates have resulted in an 
      estimated population of approximately 800,000 adults with congenital heart
      disease. Despite successful surgical repair or palliation, these individuals
      present the anesthesia provider with a multitude of challenges. Individualized
      care of these fragile patients should be approached with a keen understanding of 
      the patient's underlying cardiac anomaly. This case report chronicles the
      anesthetic care of a 36-year-old woman presenting for left-sided ureteroscopy
      with laser lithotripsy and stent placement. Her medical history was remarkable
      for the presence of complex congenital heart disease consisting of multiple
      anomalies: a double-outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, 
      pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defect, and a hypoplastic left ventricle with
      concomitant mitral valve atresia. General anesthesia was successfully
      administered, with meticulous attention given to maintenance of systemic vascular
      resistance to minimize shunting, oxygenation, administration of preprocedure
      antibiotics, and judicious replacement of intravenous fluids via air-filtered
      tubing.

PG  - 35-40
AB  - AIM: Comparative phenotypical and genetical evaluation of pathogenic potential of
      Staphylococcus aureus strains, isolated from resident bacterial carriers,
      residing on the territories with anthropogenic pollution of air environment of
      varying intensity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: S. aureus, isolated 3 times from mucous
      membrane of the anterior of nose from 210 children, were the object of the study.
      Anti-carnosine activity and biofilm formation was determined by a photometric
      method, antibiotics resistance--by a disc diffusion method. lukS, lukF, sec 3,
      clfA, clfB, agr and mecA gene detection, that are associated with S. aureus, was 
      carried out by PCR. RESULTS: S. aureus strains, isolated from children, residing 
      on the territories with a high level of anthropogenic pollution of air
      environment, were characterized by antibiotics resistance, higher values of
      anti-carnosine activity, 2 times more frequently formed biofilms with higher
      values of the parameter. clfA and clfB genes, that determine colonization of
      mucous membranes, and agr gene were detected in all the studied S. aureus
      strains, lukF and sec 3 genes were detected in 20-40% of the strains, isolated
      from children, residing on both territories. mecA and lukS genetical determinants
      were not detected. CONCLUSION: S. aureus, isolated from children, residing on the
      territories with high levels of anthropogenic pollution of air environment; were 
      characterized by higher values of the studied factors of persistence and
      stability against antibiotics. Genetical determinants of pathogenicity were not
      detected in S. aureus, isolated from individuals, residing on both territories.

TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae Sap transporter mediates bacterium-epithelial cell
      homeostasis.
PG  - 43-54
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00942-12 [doi]
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is a commensal inhabitant of the human 
      nasopharynx and a causative agent of otitis media and other diseases of the upper
      and lower human airway. During colonization within the host, NTHI must acquire
      essential nutrients and evade immune attack. We previously demonstrated that the 
      NTHI Sap transporter, an inner membrane protein complex, mediates resistance to
      antimicrobial peptides and is required for heme homeostasis. We hypothesized that
      Sap transporter functions are critical for NTHI interaction with the host
      epithelium and establishment of colonization. Thus, we cocultured the parent or
      the sapA mutant on polarized epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface,
      as a physiological model of NTHI colonization, to determine the contribution of
      the Sap transporter to bacterium-host cell interactions. Although SapA-deficient 
      NTHI was less adherent to epithelial cells, we observed a significant increase in
      invasive bacteria compared to the parent strain. Upon internalization, the sapA
      mutant appeared free in the cytoplasm, whereas the parent strain was primarily
      found in endosomes, indicating differential subcellular trafficking.
      Additionally, we observed reduced inflammatory cytokine production by the
      epithelium in response to the sapA mutant strain compared to the parental strain.
      Furthermore, chinchilla middle ears challenged with the sapA mutant demonstrated 
      a decrease in disease severity compared to ears challenged with the parental
      strain. Collectively, our data suggest that NTHI senses host environmental cues
      via Sap transporter function to mediate interaction with host epithelial cells.
      Epithelial cell invasion and modulation of host inflammatory cytokine responses
      may promote NTHI colonization and access to essential nutrients.

TI  - Lady Windermere revisited: treatment with thoracoscopic lobectomy/segmentectomy
      for right middle lobe and lingular bronchiectasis associated with non-tuberculous
      mycobacterial disease.
PG  - 671-5
LID - 10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.12.028 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lady Windermere syndrome is a well-known but poorly understood female 
      predominant phenotype of isolated right middle lobe and lingular bronchiectasis
      associated with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. Despite lengthy
      multidrug antibiotic treatment, the presence of damaged parenchymal tissue leads 
      to symptomatic disease recurrence, often with resistant organisms. The use of
      surgical resection as an adjunct to medical therapy may alter this cycle,
      although little is known about the use of thoracoscopic lung resection in this
      patient population. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a prospectively
      collected database of patients with pulmonary NTM disease from July 2004 to
      December 2009. All patients had focal bronchiectasis of the right middle lobe and
      lingula, treated with targeted antimicrobial therapy for several months prior to 
      resection. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients underwent 172 operations, with 38
      patients having staged bilateral resections. The cohort was predominately female 
      (96%) and Caucasian (95%), with a mean age of 59 years (range 34-81 years). Using
      a thoracoscopic approach in all patients, 102 middle lobectomies and 70
      lingulectomies were performed. Conversion to open thoracotomy occurred in five
      cases (3%). Secondary procedures were performed in 20 cases (12%). There was no
      operative mortality. Postoperative morbidity was noted following 12 operations
      (7%), primarily consisting of prolonged air leak. The mean length of stay was 3.3
      days (range 1-15 days). CONCLUSIONS: Although medical therapy remains the primary
      treatment modality for patients with pulmonary NTM disease, the selective use of 
      pulmonary resection may reduce the incidence of symptomatic disease recurrence.
      The addition of thoracoscopic resection to treatment regimens for patients with
      Lady Windermere syndrome can be accomplished with minimal morbidity and
      mortality.

      alginate wound dressing.
PG  - 233-43
LID - 10.1089/sur.2013.050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma) 
      is being investigated for use in wound healing. Alginate gel, already in clinical
      use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. This study
      reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong
      antimicrobial properties. METHODS: Alginate gel was treated with non-thermal
      plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. At 15 min after this,
      bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4- 
      nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The anti-biofilm
      efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the 
      treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect.
      The proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to
      the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. Scanning 
      electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated
      with exposure to bacterial pathogens. The treated gel was tested against
      Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis,
      Candida albicans, and C. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9)
      colony-forming units [CFU]/mL), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel
      dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe
      and the gel surface were kept constant. RESULTS: Non-thermal-plasma-treated
      alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the
      pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) CFU/mL and within 15 sec of
      treatment. The treated gel inactivated 10(9) CFU/mL of the organisms within 1
      min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in
      biofilms. The plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and
      endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well
      across a wound area over a period of time. Dressings made with the treated gel
      retained their biocidal effects for about a month. Scanning electron microscopy
      showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial
      pathogens on plasma exposure. CONCLUSION: A non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate
      gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical
      site infection, and promote wound healing.

TI  - Plasma deposition of silver nanoparticles on ultrafiltration membranes:
      antibacterial and anti-biofouling properties.
PG  - 524-537
AB  - A novel and versatile plasma reactor was used to modify Polyethersulphone
      commercial membranes. The equipment was applied to: i) functionalize the
      membranes with low-temperature plasmas, ii) deposit a film of poly(methyl
      methacrylate) (PMMA) by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) and,
      iii) deposit silver nanoparticles (SNP) by Gas Flow Sputtering. Each modification
      process was performed in the same reactor consecutively, without exposure of the 
      membranes to atmospheric air. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission
      electron microscopy were used to characterize the particles and modified
      membranes. SNP are evenly distributed on the membrane surface. Particle fixation 
      and transport inside membranes were assessed before- and after-washing assays by 
      X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling analysis. PMMA addition improved
      SNP fixation. Plasma-treated membranes showed higher hydrophilicity.
      Anti-biofouling activity was successfully achieved against Gram-positive
      (Enterococcus faecalis) and -negative (Salmonella Typhimurium) bacteria.
      Therefore, disinfection by ultrafiltration showed substantial resistance to
      biofouling. The post-synthesis functionalization process developed provides a
      more efficient fabrication route for anti-biofouling and anti-bacterial membranes
      used in the water treatment field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
      first report of a gas phase condensation process combined with a PECVD procedure 
      in order to deposit SNP on commercial membranes to inhibit biofouling formation.

TI  - Management of influenza.
PG  - 1087-95
AB  - Influenza is a contagious airborne viral illness characterized by abrupt onset of
      symptoms. Fever, myalgia, headache, rhinitis, sore throat, and cough are commonly
      reported symptoms. The diagnosis should be made clinically, and the decision to
      begin antiviral therapy should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of
      influenza. The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is expected to continue to 
      circulate during the 2010-2011 season, but it is not certain whether it will
      replace or cocirculate with seasonal influenza A subtypes that have been
      circulating since 1977. The 2009 H1N1 virus is largely resistant to adamantanes, 
      but it is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir.
      Neuraminidase inhibitors have modest effectiveness in reducing influenza-related 
      symptoms in patients at low risk of complications. Patients at high risk of
      complications, including pregnant women, should be treated with antiviral agents,
      preferably within 48 hours of symptom onset. Family physicians should follow
      guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention when treating patients with influenza or influenza-like symptoms.

PG  - 139-45
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.060 [doi]
AB  - There is a rather limited understanding concerning the antibiotic-resistance of
      the airborne S. aureus and the transmission of the antibiotic-resistant genes it 
      carries Therefore, we isolated 149 S. aureus strains from the samples collected
      from the feces, the indoor air and the outdoor air of 6 chicken farms, and
      performed the research on them with 15 types of antibiotics and the REP-PCR trace
      identification. The 100% homologous strains were selected to conduct the research
      on the carrying and transmission status of the antibiotic-resistant genes. The
      results revealed that 5.37% strains (8/149) were resistant to methicillins
      (MRSA), and 94% strains (140/149) were resistant to compound sulfamethoxazole,
      etc. In addition, these strains displayed a resistance to multiple antibiotics
      (4, 5 or 6 types) and there were also 3 strains resistant to 9 antibiotics. It
      should be noted that the antibiotic-resistance of some strains isolated from the 
      feces, the indoor and outdoor air was basically the same, and the strains with
      the same REP-PCR trace identification result carried the same type of
      antibiotic-resistant genes. The results showed that airborne transmission not
      only causes the spread of epidemic diseases but also exerts threats to the public
      health of a community.

PG  - 45-7
AB  - The study was undertaken to evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity of microorganisms
      that were used in biotechnological production and belonged to different taxons:
      gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus
      thuringiensis) and gram-negative (Alcaligenes denitrificans and Pseudomonas
      caryophylii) bacteria and noncardioform actinomycetes (Rhodococcus erythropolis
      and Rhodococcus corallinus). The sensitivity of the strains to a range of
      antibiotics was determined by the agar diffuse method. Industrial strains
      responded differently to test antibiotics. Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria
      of the genus Bacillus are most sensitive to antibiotics; the representatives of
      the genus Rhodococcus are moderately sensitive and the gram-negative bacteria of 
      the genera Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes are resistant to a large number of basic
      antibiotics and new-generation ones. The findings were made to serve as the basis
      for developing selective microbiological assays for environment quality control
      (the air of populated areas or a working zone), which were legally adopted.

TI  - Knowledge gaps on paediatric respiratory infections in Morocco, Northern Africa.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s13690-015-0076-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of acute respiratory infections (ARI) among Moroccan
      children remains significant. However, scarce information is available regarding 
      trends in its epidemiology and etiology, or regarding its associated prognostic
      factors. The purpose of this work was to review available data on the burden of
      ARI among children under five years of age in Morocco. METHODS: A systematic
      review was conducted for the period 1997-2014 using the PRISMA proposed
      methodology. Various online databases were screened, in addition to physical
      libraries of Moroccan medical schools, and official reports of the Moroccan
      Ministry of Health. Search queries in English and French languages included:
      Respiratory Tract Infections, pneumonia, epidemiology, etiology, microbiology,
      mortality and Morocco. The documents were included for analysis when they
      reported original data on the incidence, distribution, or a clinical description 
      of the diseases or their etiology or described clinical management or national
      preventive strategies. RESULTS: Thirty-two documents were included in the final
      analysis. 21 of which had been published. In 2012, ARI caused 13% of paediatric
      deaths, half of the consultations at health facilities and third of the
      paediatric admissions. The microorganisms more frequently identified among
      hospitalized children were Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%) and Haemophilus
      influenza type b (Hib) (15%). The MOH introduced Hib vaccines into the national
      immunization program (PNI) in 2007and the 13-valent vaccine against pneumococcus 
      in 2010. The national first line antibiotics recommended for non-severe
      ambulatory treatment is Amoxicillin. Studies of antibiotic resistance showed from
      1998 to 2008 a 22% increase in the rate of penicillin non-susceptibility among
      Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Viral respiratory infections and the role
      attributed to air pollution in the incidence of ARI have been poorly
      characterized. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts should be made towards the
      development of adequate surveillance programs to better clarify the epidemiology,
      etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the effectiveness of the
      preventives and curatives strategies in place against paediatric ARIs in Morocco.
      Additionally, a holistical approach should be used to identify the heath
      determinants of ARIs among children.

      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the conservative dentistry 
      section of the School of Dentistry, Aichi-Gakuin University, was investigated.
      Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) were detected in 8
      (20.5%) of 39 dental staff (28 dentists, 8 dental hygienists, and 3 dental
      assistants), but MRSA was not detected. MRCNS was also detected in locations such
      as the dental chair, dental bracket, dental cabinet, and floor, as well as in
      airborne samples. The presence of the same strain in both the oral cavity of
      staff persons and the dental chair/floor locations was determined by biochemical 
      properties, antibiotic sensitivity tests, and electrophoretic patterns.

      composites have potent antibacterial activity toward both gram-positive and
      gram-negative bacteria. The materials form good coatings on surfaces and kill
      both airborne and waterborne bacteria. Surfaces coated with these composites
      resist biofilm formation. These composites are different from other
      silver-containing antibacterial materials both in the ease of synthesis and in
      the use of a silver salt nanoparticle instead of elemental silver or complex
      silver compounds. We also demonstrate the ability to tune the release of biocidal
      Ag(+) ions from these composites by controlling the size of the embedded AgBr
      nanoparticles. These composites are potentially useful as antimicrobial coatings 
      in a wide variety of biomedical and general use applications.

      Santos, SP, Brazil.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - This study involved a total of 116 samples, 79 taken from pigeon droppings and 37
      of atmospheric air taken close to accumulations of excrement. Cryptococcus
      neoformans var. grubii was isolated from 11 (13.9%) of these samples. Other
      species of Cryptococcus were also isolated from these samples, such as C. albidus
      (12.6%) and C. laurentii (8.9%). C. neoformans was not isolated from the air
      samples, though C. albidus (5.4%) was. All the strains of C. neoformans were
      found to belong to the A serotype (C. neoformans var. grubii). In regard to the
      studies with the antifungal agents 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, itraconazole,
      amphotericin B and voriconazole, by means of the microdilution method (EUCAST),
      we point out that one sample demonstrated resistance to fluconazole, this being
      especially significant because this is an environmental strain.

PG  - 587-91
AB  - A 67-year-old man with castration-resistant prostate cancer associated with
      multiple bone metastases had been treated with zoledronic acid and docetaxel.
      Although there was no evidence of damage around the right lower jaw bone, the
      patient complained of pain in May 2011, which worsened during the next 2 weeks
      and was followed by difficulty with breathing. Computed tomographic (CT) findings
      of the cervical area showed swelling of the cervical tissue with air and
      tightening of the trachea, suggesting cellulitis caused by gas gangrene. He was
      intubated and treated with antibiotics. On the 12th hospital day, CT scan
      revealed a pharyngeal abscess and we performed a drainage operation. On the 20th 
      hospital day, bone of the intraoral lower jaw was exposed, revealing that the
      infection was caused by osteonecrosis. Additional CT findings showed the abscess 
      extending to the mediastinum and multiple liver metastases. Although antibiotic
      therapy was continued, the patient died of liver failure on the 61st day.

      Organization. Delegates attending the Sixty-Eighth WHA, May 2015, covered a wide 
      range of global challenges and agreed on several key resolutions of importance to
      nurse leaders. Some of the resolutions adopted relevant for nurse leaders and
      nursing care such as air pollution, strategies to strengthen epilepsy care,
      antimicrobial drug resistance, and strategies to strengthen surgical care, are
      highlighted. Nurse leaders should consider attending the World Health Assembly,
      as the topics discussed are critical for the future directions of strengthening
      human resources for health worldwide and, in particular, nursing and midwifery
      services.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance genes in multidrug-resistant Enterococcus spp. and
      Streptococcus spp. recovered from the indoor air of a large-scale swine-feeding
      operation.
PG  - 534-40
AB  - AIMS: In this study, multidrug-resistant bacteria previously recovered from the
      indoor air of a large-scale swine-feeding operation were tested for the presence 
      of five macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) resistance genes and five 
      tetracycline (tet) resistance genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterococcus spp. (n = 
      16) and Streptococcus spp. (n =16) were analysed using DNA-DNA hybridization,
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and oligoprobing of PCR products. All isolates
      carried multiple MLS resistance genes, while 50% of the Enterococcus spp. and 44%
      of the Streptococcus spp. also carried multiple tet resistance genes. All
      Enterococcus spp. carried erm(A) and erm(B), 69% carried erm(F), 44% carried
      mef(A), 75% carried tet(M), 69% carried tet(L) and 19% carried tet(K). All
      Streptococcus spp. carried erm(B), 94% carried erm(F), 75% carried erm(A), 38%
      carried mef(A), 50% carried tet(M), 81% carried tet(L) and 13% carried tet(K).
      CONCLUSIONS: Multidrug resistance among airborne bacteria recovered from a swine 
      operation is encoded by multiple MLS and tet resistance genes. These are the
      first data regarding resistance gene carriage among airborne bacteria from
      swine-feeding operations. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The high
      prevalence of multiple resistance genes reported here suggests that airborne
      Gram-positive bacteria from swine operations may be important contributors to
      environmental reservoirs of resistance genes.

TI  - From milk to rifampicin and back again: history of failures and successes in the 
      treatment for tuberculosis.
PG  - 661-5
LID - 10.1038/ja.2014.108 [doi]
AB  - The millennial flight against tuberculosis has been characterized by several
      defeats. Roman physicians suggested to consumptives better nutrition, sea voyages
      and change of air, while, during the Middle Ages, 'royal touch' were considered
      as an effective remedy for scrofula. In the following centuries, phthisis was
      cured using old herbal preparations and new chemical compounds, mainly aimed at
      soothing symptoms; in addition, harmful approaches (for example, bleeding and
      purging) were commonly accepted, according to medical theories of that time. In
      the second part of the nineteenth century, the discovery of the contagious nature
      of consumption (Villemin, Koch) addressed physicians and scientists toward
      often-unsuccessful remedies, such as antiparasitic treatment, immunomodulants,
      vaccination and serum therapy. In that period only sanatorium regimen--based on
      aerotherapy, bed rest, better nutrition, sunbathing and moderate physical
      exercise--appeared to provide first partial successes. In these structures, more 
      invasive approaches were also employed, such as lung collapse surgical
      interventions (for example, phrenicotomy, thoracoplasty) and artificial
      pneumothorax. Since the second part of the twentieth century, the
      industrialization of pharmacotherapy, the development of antimicrobial
      chemotherapy and the introduction of new antibiotics (streptomycin, isoniazid,
      para-aminosalicylic acid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) deeply revolutionized
      treatment for tuberculosis, allowing to achieve important successes. In this same
      period, the figure of Piero Sensi (1920-2013) deserves to be recalled for his
      contribution in the development of rifampicin that played a decisive role in the 
      chemical fight against the white plague. Nowadays, antibiotic resistance is an
      emerging problem, representing a new challenge for physicians and scientists who 
      sometimes re-proposed old 'historical' approaches.

TI  - Investigations of the bacteriologic factors in cervical disk surgery.
PG  - 272-5
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential risk of wound infection in
      cervical disk disease, the appropriateness of the current prophylactic regimen of
      intravenous cefazolin at Good Samaritan Hospital, and the increasing resistance
      of coagulase-negative staphylococci in nosocomial infections. In addition, the
      methodology used in three prior studies was used to verify that double-gloving is
      a more effective barrier to bacterial contamination than single-gloving and that 
      topical streptomycin lavage is superior to constant irrigation with plain saline.
      No wound infections were documented in the 40 patients who underwent cervical
      disk surgery in a 12-month period. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were
      the most common bacterial isolate, but only 20% were resistant to cefazolin. Of
      the 11 S. aureus isolates, 9 were sensitive to cefazolin and 2 were methicillin
      resistant. A remarkable 95% (114/120) of the intraoperative wound cultures were
      free of bacteria. In only 2 cases was there a serial increase in colonies of the 
      same organism over the course of the operation. There was one positive glove
      culture--coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sensitive to cefazolin. The patient's 
      skin was identified as the source of contamination in 3 intraoperative cultures
      of the wound and 2 cultures of the ambient operating room air. Neither individual
      biotyping of bacteria nor antimicrobial susceptibility testing uncovered any
      consistent source or pattern to account for the organisms in the surgical wound
      or ambient operating room air. Bacteria resistant to cefazolin were found in 36% 
      of the intraoperative environmental cultures but in only 16% of the isolates from
      patients' skin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

      resistant bacteria and erythromycin resistant bacteria from 22 animal feeding
      operations in three districts of Beijing. The results indicated that the highest 
      and lowest concentrations of these three types of bioaerosol were detected in pig
      and cow house, respectively. The concentration of airborne bacteria was higher in
      layer house, whereas concentration of antibiotic resistant bacteria was higher in
      broiler house. Tetracycline and erythromycin resistant bacteria were detected
      from the atmospheric environment from out door of layer and broiler house with
      the percentages of 8.81%, 15.89% and 23.19%, 36.53%, respectively. The size
      distribution and aerodynamic diameter varied from inside and outside of pig, cow,
      and layer and broiler house. Most of tetracycline resistant bacteria and
      erythromycin resistant bacteria from current four types of animal feeding
      operations mainly deposited in pharynx, larynx and bronchus of respiratory
      system. This study would offer the base data for evaluating the detriment of
      bioaerosol from animal feeding operations to the worker and environment.

TI  - Completing an ironman triathlon with pneumonia: a case report.
PG  - 223-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Athletes present a different category of the population. Trivial
      complaints may mask more serious illness, especially when the athlete is
      undergoing intensive training, and the function of his immune system may be
      sub-optimal. CASE PRESENTATION: A triathlete presented a few days after
      completing an Ironman race, complaining of lethargy, pleuritic chest pain and
      loss of appetite. On examination he was afebrile, tachycardic and had decreased
      lower left lung air entry accompanied by crackling. A chest x-ray revealed
      left-sided basal pneumonia with a para-pneumonic effusion. Blood tests were
      unremarkable. The athlete was treated with oral antibiotics, and was advised to
      stop exercise completely for eight weeks. He made a full recovery and completed
      further Ironman races within a year. CONCLUSION: The case highlights that
      clinicians treating elite endurance athletes must exclude severe infection, even 
      when the clinical signs are few or absent. The reason is that if these athletes
      continue to train, serious complications could ensue due to their compromised
      resistance to infection.

TI  - Structural and biochemical characterization of N5-carboxyaminoimidazole
      ribonucleotide synthetase and N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide mutase from
      Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 707-15
LID - 10.1107/S0907444911023821 [doi]
AB  - With the rapid rise of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections,
      new strategies against S. aureus are urgently needed. De novo purine biosynthesis
      is a promising yet unexploited target, insofar as abundant evidence has shown
      that bacteria with compromised purine biosynthesis are attenuated. Fundamental
      differences exist within the process by which humans and bacteria convert
      5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole
      ribonucleotide (CAIR). In bacteria, this transformation occurs through a two-step
      conversion catalyzed by PurK and PurE; in humans, it is mediated by a one-step
      conversion catalyzed by class II PurE. Thus, these bacterial enzymes are
      potential targets for selective antibiotic development. Here, the first
      comprehensive structural and biochemical characterization of PurK and PurE from
      S. aureus is presented. Structural analysis of S. aureus PurK reveals a
      nonconserved phenylalanine near the AIR-binding site that occupies the putative
      position of the imidazole ring of AIR. Mutation of this phenylalanine to
      isoleucine or tryptophan reduced the enzyme efficiency by around tenfold. The
      K(m) for bicarbonate was determined for the first time for a PurK enzyme and was 
      found to be approximately 18.8 mM. The structure of PurE is described in
      comparison to that of human class II PurE. It is confirmed biochemically that
      His38 is essential for function. These studies aim to provide foundations for
      future structure-based drug-discovery efforts against S. aureus purine
      biosynthesis.

TI  - Characterization of microorganisms isolated from lignite excavated from the
      Zahorie coal mine (southwestern Slovakia).
PG  - 932-43
AB  - Microorganisms were isolated from lignite freshly excavated in the Zahorie coal
      mine (southwestern Slovakia) under conditions excluding contamination with either
      soil or air-borne microorganisms. The isolates represented both Prokarya and
      Eukarya (fungi). All were able to grow on standard media, although some
      microorganisms were unstable and became extinct during storage of coal samples.
      Bacteria belonged to the genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Rhodococcus,
      according to both morphological criteria and ITS sequences. Several bacterial
      isolates were resistant to antibiotics. The presence of anaerobic bacteria was
      also documented, although they have not yet been identified. Fungal isolates were
      typified by using their ITS sequences. They belonged to the genera Trichoderma
      (Hypocrea), Penicillium, Epicoccum, Metarhizium (Cordyceps), and Cladosporium.
      Several fungi produced compounds with antibiotic action against standard
      bacterial strains. The evidence for the presence of microorganisms in native
      lignite was obtained by means of fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron
      microscopy, and electron microprobe analysis. Results demonstrated that
      microorganisms were able to survive in the low-rank coal over a long time period.

AB  - Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus showing unstable resistance to kanamycin,
      streptomycin, lincomycin and penicillin have been preserved by drying. Particular
      attention has been paid to organisms showing linked resistance to pairs of these 
      antibiotics. Recoveries of viable cells from the desiccates was high and the
      proportion of resistant and sensitive cells was maintained both during storage
      and during heating. The preservation of the organisms on ceramic beads stored in 
      air over silica gel promises to be an effective and convenient method for
      maintaining staphylococcal desiccates during studies of unstable antibiotic
      resistance.

TI  - Aerial dispersal of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hospital rooms 
      by infected or colonised patients.
PG  - 256-62
LID - 10.1016/j.jhin.2008.11.015 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess to what extent patients with
      meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at respiratory sites shed
      viable MRSA into the air of hospital rooms. We also evaluated whether the
      distance from the patient could influence the level of contamination. Air
      sampling was performed directly onto MRSA-selective agar in 24 hospital rooms
      containing patients with MRSA colonization or infection of the respiratory tract.
      Samplings were performed in duplicate at 0.5, 1 and 2-3 m from the patients'
      heads. Clinical and environmental isolates were compared using antimicrobial
      resistance patterns and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. MRSA strains were
      isolated from 21 out of 24 rooms, in quantities varying from between 1 and 78
      cfu/m3. In each of the 21 rooms, at least one of the environmental isolates was
      identical to a clinical isolate from the patient in that room. There was no
      significant difference in MRSA counts between the distance from the patient's
      head and the sampler. This study demonstrates that most patients with MRSA
      infection or colonisation of the respiratory tract shed viable MRSA into the air 
      of their room. The results emphasise the need to study MRSA in air in more detail
      in order to improve infection control recommendations.

TI  - Lung mucin production is stimulated by the air pollutant residual oil fly ash.
PG  - 86-92
AB  - Human and animal exposure to particulate air pollution is correlated with airway 
      mucus hypersecretion and increased susceptibility to infection. Seeking clues to 
      the mechanisms underlying this pathology, we examined the effect of the
      particulate air pollutant residual oil fly ash (ROFA) on production of the major 
      component of mucus, mucin, and the major antibacterial protein of the respiratory
      tract, lysozyme. We found that following in vitro exposure to ROFA, epithelial
      cells showed an increase in mucin (MUC5AC) and lysozyme (LYS) steady state mRNA. 
      This upregulation was controlled at least partly at the level of transcription as
      shown by reporter assays. Experiments testing the ability of the major components
      of ROFA to mimic these effects showed that vanadium, a metal making up 18.8% by
      weight, accounted for the bulk of the response. A screen of signaling inhibitors 
      showed that MUC5AC and LYS induction by ROFA are mediated by dissimilar signaling
      pathways, both of which are, however, phosphotyrosine dependent. Recognizing that
      the ROFA constituent vanadium is a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and that
      mucin induction by pathogens is phophotyrosine dependent, we suggest that
      vanadium-containing air pollutants trigger disease-like conditions by unmasking
      phosphorylation-dependent pathogen resistance pathways.

TI  - Fungicidal properties of Pinus sylvestris L. for improvement of air quality.
PG  - 787-94
AB  - Sick building syndrome is a term commonly used to describe the consequences of
      poor indoor air quality. It is well documented that first of all air quality
      depends on the chemical composition, and until now negligible attention has been 
      paid to air pollution by microorganisms. Some species of fungi (Aspergillus
      flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. parasiticus, A. oryzea and other) and their
      toxins cause difficulty in breathing, allergic rhinitis, watery eyes, headaches, 
      and flu-like symptoms. Over recent years considerable interest has been developed
      for plant extracts that would be of great use for the improvement of air quality.
      The biological activity of Pinus sylvestris L. has been investigated in order to 
      find out its fungicidal activity against airborne microorganisms. It was
      determined, that fungi from Aspergillus and Penicillium genera dominated indoors.
      Antimicrobial activity of pine oil was evaluated by technique of oil diffusion to
      Czapek agar (for fungi), malt extract agar (for yeast and yeast-like fungi) and
      nutrient agar (for bacteria). Minimum inhibitory concentrations of pine oil to 13
      species (8 fungi, 2 yeast-like fungi, yeast and 2 bacteria,) were determined:
      1.0-2.5, 1.0-1.2, 0.5-0.75, and 0.75-1.2% (v/v), respectively. According to
      resistance to pine oil action, microorganisms grouped themselves as following:
      fungi, spore bacteria, yeast-like fungi, yeast, and bacteria (fungi being the
      most resistive and bacteria being the least resistive). The most active
      concentration of pine oil against all tested microorganisms was 2.5%, and the
      most sensitive fungus to volatiles was Ulocladium oudemansii.

TI  - Fed-batch bioproduction of spectinomycin.
PG  - 1-46
AB  - Actinomycetes produce about 67% of the known antibiotics covering a wide range of
      chemical structures. However, their filamentous growth present several problems
      during industrial processes. Among these problems oxygen transfer limitation is
      critical. In this chapter we present the role of oxygen in spectinomycin
      production by a Streptomyces species. Spectinomycin, a broad spectrum antibiotic 
      effective against penicillin resistant gonorrhea, is an aminoglycoside
      constituted from two glucose moieties. Its bioproduction is strongly influenced
      by glucose and oxygen. We have shown that for a fixed dissolved oxygen
      concentration, there are two specific glucose concentrations which give maximum
      final titers of spectinomycin. The bi-modal maximum indicates the influence of
      two intermediate metabolites in spectinomycin biosynthesis. We propose a
      mechanism for spectinomycin biosynthesis and subsequently develop a model based
      on this mechanism. The proposed mechanism for spectinomycin biosynthesis is
      validated by successfully reconstructing the air flow rate profiles. A nonlinear 
      systems theory technique termed External Differential Representation, is
      implemented to reconstruct the spectinomycin bioconversion process which then
      predicts the spectinomycin concentration from the air flow rate profile. This
      signifies that spectinomycin titers in industrial fed-batch processes can be
      controlled if a priori information about the air flow rate profile yielding
      maximum spectinomycin is available.

AB  - Based on a study of 105 patients and a comprehensive literature review we
      recommend a prophylactic regimen for orthopaedic procedures which is easily
      adaptable to the needs of individual clinics. The regimen is especially designed 
      for joint replacements and includes basically the following four points: 1.
      parenteral prophylaxis with cefazolin 1 g every 6 hours for 24 hours; the first
      dose is given between 10 and 30 minutes before surgery (for knee-replacement the 
      initial dose is 2 g); 2. use of bone cement impregnated with antibiotics, e.g.
      Palacos-Gentamycin-cement; 3. when possible the operation should be performed in 
      a theater equipped with "ultra-clean-air" laminar air-flow and the surgeon should
      wear "whole-body-exhaust" suits or suits made of "Fabric 450"; 4. antibiotic
      selection as outlined in points one and two must be adjusted over time based on
      ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in the individual clinic.

TI  - Infection prevention during profound granulocytopenia. New approaches to
      alimentary canal microbial suppression.
PG  - 358-61
AB  - During the past 10 years the concepts of total reverse isolation using laminar
      air flow rooms and alimentary canal microbial suppression using oral
      nonabsorbable antibiotics have each been proved effective in reducing serious
      infection for patients with profound, prolonged granulocytopenia. When these two 
      modalities are combined, the net reduction in infections is about 75%. Oral
      nonabsorbable antibiotics, however, are poorly tolerated, costly, and frequently 
      associated with the acquisition of resistant gram-negative rods when used outside
      the laminar air flow room setting. The concept of colonization resistance may be 
      the new approach needed for microbial suppression of the nonisolated patient. If 
      the anaerobic flora is undisturbed, newly acquired organisms generally cannot
      colonize the patient. Agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole suppress many 
      of the potentially pathogenic aerobic bacteria but not the anaerobes, leaving
      colonization resistance relatively intact. The result thus far has been a
      reduction in infection without a concurrent increase in colonization or infection
      by organisms resistant to the antimicrobial agents commonly used for therapy.

AB  - Cervical necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon but potentially fatal infection
      characterized by rapidly progressive, widespread necrosis of the superficial
      fascia. The authors report a case of cervical necrotizing fasciitis of
      odontogenic origin in a male with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. An early
      diagnosis was based on clinical examination, confirmed by computed tomography
      (CT) scan, which showed multiple collections of air in the left submandibular,
      submental and cervical region. Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was started
      quickly followed by surgical drainage and debridement. Pus culture was positive
      for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Four days after admission,
      mediastinitis was revealed by CT and drainage was conducted through a
      transcervical incision. The patient was treated successfully with antimicrobial
      therapy, repeated surgical debridement and supportive care.

TI  - Nosocomial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus via the
      surfaces of the dental operatory.
PG  - 297-300; discussion 291
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assess the possibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) transmission via the surfaces of the dental operatory. METHODS: A
      survey of MRSA contamination on the surfaces of the dental operatory, and an
      analysis of MRSA transmission via the dental operatory between patients was
      carried out in the department of special dental care and oral surgery. RESULTS:
      MRSA was observed on the surfaces of dental operatory including the air-water
      syringe and reclining chair. Nosocomial infection or colonisation of MRSA
      occurred in eight out of 140 consecutive patients who had no evidence of MRSA at 
      admission. Antibiograms of 30 antibiotics revealed that the isolates from the
      eight patients were of the same strain as those from the surface of dental
      operatory. After treating the patients under a revised infection control (IC)
      protocol including a single use of barrier covers, MRSA was not detected on the
      surfaces of the dental operatory, and no nosocomial infection or colonisation
      occurred during hospitalisation (0/117 patients). CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that MRSA contaminates the surfaces of the dental operatory, and
      therefore the dental operatory should be considered a possible reservoir of MRSA.

TI  - Thin film formation by rough form lipopolysaccharide and interaction with
      cationic antibiotic polymyxin B.
PG  - 169-76
AB  - A monolayer film of the rough form of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Erwinia
      carotovora at an air-water interface was transferred onto solid substrates to
      form a multilayer film. The LPS was deposited on hydrophobic graphite as well as 
      on hydrophilic platinum plates. The thickness of the LPS film prepared by a
      single dipping and removal of the graphite was estimated at 2.7 nm by atomic
      force microscopy. The repeated dipping of the platinum plate indicated early
      saturation with reduced subsequent absorption from the pure water subphase, while
      successive transfers of the LPS were observed from a 2.0 mM MgCl2 solution. The
      LPS film on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) interacted with cationic
      antibiotic polymyxin B in the solution and exhibited a downward shift of resonant
      frequency and resistance in proportion to its concentration. The resonant
      resistance change against the resonant frequency axis was parallel in this
      interaction. The absorption of the antibiotic on the LPS film prepared in the
      presence of MgCl2 indicated an increase in mass, but little change in
      viscoelasticity. A multilayer film of LPS on the QCM was found suitable for
      subsequent characterizations.

TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis in heart surgery].
PG  - S78-87
AB  - Cardiac surgery enters mainly into the class I of Altemeier ("clean surgery").
      However, many factors may explain an intraoperative contamination: surgery of
      long duration, extra-corporeal circulation, aspiration of blood and air,
      immunodepression...). In fact, the infectious risk decreases from about 25% with 
      placebo to 5% with prophylactic antibiotics. The staphylococcal infections are
      the most frequent (mediastinitis, endocarditis, parietal infections...).
      Cephalosporins, particularly of second-generation type (cefamandole, cefuroxime),
      perform better than antistaphylococcal penicillins. The combination with an
      amino-side may be used when Gram negative bacilli infection prevalence is high.
      Vancomycin is efficient but hypotension and renal impairment have been reported. 
      Therefore, vancomycin is used in patients allergic to cephalosporins, when a high
      prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus or enterococci infections is
      reported, or when the patient has recently received broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
      therapy. The antibiotic doses must take into account the haemodilution due to
      extracorporeal circulation and the necessity to obtain sufficient serum
      concentrations throughout surgery. A prophylaxis of more than 48 hours is not
      associated with an improved outcome. In cardiac transplantation a prophylaxis is 
      essential, but is still questioned during the insertion of pace-markers. In any
      case, the antibiotic prophylaxis must take into account the bacterial prevalence 
      of each institution.

TI  - Medical considerations for the pregnant traveler.
PG  - 371-88
AB  - The care of pregnant travelers requires clinical information and skills that are 
      derived from many disciplines. Issues to be considered include the safety of both
      mother and fetus during commercial air travel, vigorous exercise, scuba diving,
      and even high-altitude trekking. Immunizations require a balanced approach to the
      risk of disease versus the risks of vaccine complications. Safe or treated water 
      sources are of paramount importance to prevent unnecessary exposure to
      antimicrobial and antiparasitic agents during pregnancy. Malaria prophylaxis is
      made even more difficult by an increasingly widespread resistance of Plasmodium
      species to chloroquine.

AB  - A 31-year-old African American woman with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (recent CD4 count of 66/mm) presented to the
      emergency room with a tension pneumothorax that required an emergent chest tube
      placement. Computed tomography scan showed fungus balls in multiple lung cavities
      and surrounding infiltrates. The patient showed remarkable improvement with
      voriconazole suggesting aspergillosis. However, the patient was serologically
      negative for Aspergillus and other common fungal infections. Because of a
      persistent air leak, surgical intervention was needed. The histological finding
      was consistent with invasive mycosis, and cultures were positive for Scedosporium
      apiospermum. Literature review showed that, among patients with HIV/AIDS,
      Scedosporium can present from focal localized to systemic disease, is resistant
      to traditional antifungal agents, and may respond to prompt management with
      voriconazole.

AB  - AIM: To conduct epidemiological and ecological surveillance of cholera in
      freshwater environments. METHODS AND RESULTS: A freshwater region of India was
      surveyed between April 2007 and December 2008. Vibrio cholerae was isolated from 
      59.5% of water and plankton samples (n = 357) and 35.5% of stool samples (n =
      290). Isolation from water was dependent on air (r = 0.44) and water temperatures
      (r = 0.49) (P < 0.01) but was independent of rainfall (r = 0.15), chlorophyll a
      (r = 0.18), salinity (r = 0.2) or pH (r = 0.2) (P > 0.05). Isolation from
      plankton was dependent on temperature of air (r = 0.45), water temperature (r =
      0.44), chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0.42), pH (r = 0.23) and salinity (r =
      0.39) (P < 0.01). Cholera cases correlated with rainfall (r = 0.82, P < 0.01) and
      chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0.42, P < 0.05), but not with air temperature (r
      = 0.3, P = 0.37). Vibrio cholerae O1 possessed ctxB, ctxA, rstR and tcpA (ElTor),
      toxR, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, mshA and hylA. Among non-O1-non-O139, the distribution of
      virulence-associated and regulatory protein genes was heterogeneous with - 0.7,
      2.2, 94.77, 97.76, 99.25, 100 and 100% isolates being positive for tcpA, toxT,
      rtxA, rtxC, hylA, toxR and mshA, respectively. Two-thirds of non-O1-non-O139
      isolates exhibited antibiotic resistance to various antibiotics that did not
      correlate with geographical site or time of origin for the isolates. RAPD and
      AFLP showed V. cholerae to be a diverse bacterium. AFLP demonstrated separate
      lineages for non-O1-non-O139 and O1 isolates. CONCLUSION: Environmental
      parameters played a significant role in the emergence and spread of cholera and
      the abundance of V. cholerae. But based on virulence gene profiling and genetic
      fingerprinting, the possibility of origin of toxigenic isolates from nontoxigenic
      environmental isolates seems unlikely in freshwater environs of India.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study explains the ecology,
      epidemiology and seasonality of cholera in freshwater environs.

AB  - Culturable single-stage impactor samples were collected onto nutrient agar in
      kitchen and bedroom areas of eight urban and four suburban residences in
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Staphylococcus aureus colonies were identified by
      replica plating of the original impactor samples onto Chapman Stone medium
      followed by isolation of up to eight colonies for coagulase testing. Kirby-Bauer 
      disk diffusion method was utilized to evaluate S. aureus resistance to both
      oxacillin and cefaclor. The median concentrations of total culturable bacteria
      observed in bedrooms and trash areas were 300 CFU/m(3) and 253 CFU/m(3),
      respectively. Median culturable Staphylococcus spp. concentrations in bedrooms
      and trash areas were 142 CFU/m(3) and 204 CFU/m(3), respectively. A total of 148 
      individual S. aureus colonies were isolated and tested for antibiotic resistance.
      Cefaclor resistance was encountered among only 6 of the 148 (4%) colonies. Nearly
      one-quarter of all S. aureus isolates tested displayed resistance (n = 30) or
      intermediate resistance (n = 5) to oxacillin. Twenty-six percent (n = 20) of
      trash area isolates and 21% (n = 15) of bedroom isolates displayed resistance or 
      intermediate resistance to oxacillin. The median difference in percent resistance
      between trash and bedroom areas was 10% (p = 0.1). Results suggest that there may
      be a systematic difference in bacterial populations between downtown and suburban
      residences. Storage of household waste and handling of food may contribute to
      presence of the organism in the air of residences.

PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/0717-6287-47-63 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cronobacter sakazakii is considered as an emerging foodborne
      pathogen. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize virulent strains 
      of Cronobacter sakazakii from food samples of Bangladesh. RESULT: Six (6)
      Cronobacter sakazakii was isolated and identified from 54 food samples on the
      basis of biochemical characteristics, sugar fermentation, SDS-PAGE of whole cell 
      protein, plasmid profile and PCR of Cronobacter spp. specific genes (esak, gluA, 
      zpx, ompA, ERIC, BOX-AIR) and sequencing. These strains were found to have
      moderately high antibiotic resistance against common antibiotics and some are
      ESBL producer. Most of the C. sakazakii isolates were capable of producing
      biofilm (strong biofilm producer), extracellular protease and siderophores, curli
      expression, haemolysin, haemagglutinin, mannose resistant haemagglutinin, had
      high cell surface hydrophobicity, significant resistance to human serum, can
      tolerate high concentration of salt, bile and DNase production. Most of them
      produced enterotoxins of different molecular weight. The isolates pose
      significant serological cross-reactivity with other gram negative pathogens such 
      as serotypes of Salmonella spp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, Shigella
      flexneri and Vibrio cholerae. They had significant tolerance to high temperature,
      low pH, dryness and osmotic stress. CONCLUSION: Special attention should be given
      in ensuring hygiene in production and post-processing to prevent contamination of
      food with such stress-tolerant virulent Cronobacter sakazakii.

TI  - Methicillin resistance of airborne coagulase-negative staphylococci in homes of
      persons having contact with a hospital environment.
PG  - 177-82
LID - 10.1016/j.ajic.2008.09.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The persons having contact with a hospital environment (hospital
      personnel workers and discharged patients) are highly exposed to colonization
      with multidrug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      airborne Staphylococcus genus features in homes in which inhabitants have had
      contact with the hospital environment. METHODS: Airborne bacteria were collected 
      using a 6-stage Anderson impactor. The Staphylococcus species composition and
      resistance to methicillin, and other antimicrobial agents among 3
      coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species (S cohnii spp cohnii, S
      epidermidis, S hominis), were determined. Antibiotic resistance of isolates was
      tested using the agar screen method with methicillin, the polymerase chain
      reaction technique to detect the mecA gene, and the disk diffusion method.
      RESULTS: A higher prevalence of methicillin-resistant (MR) strains among the
      species isolated (40% of S epidermidis, 40% of S hominis, and 60% of S cohnii spp
      cohnii) was found in homes of persons who had contact with a hospital environment
      compared with the reference homes (only 12% of S hominis). The mecA gene was
      revealed in all MR S epidermidis strains and in some MR S hominis (50%) and S
      cohnii spp cohnii (33%) strains. All isolated MR CNS strains were susceptible to 
      vancomycin, rifampicin, and linezolid. CONCLUSION: High numbers of airborne
      multidrug-resistant MR CNS in the homes of persons having contact with a hospital
      environment indicates that such inhabitants pose a risk of intrafamilial
      spreading of MR strains via air.

TI  - Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Great Britain, 1977-81: alarming
      increase in incidence and recent development of endemic transmission.
PG  - 337-40
AB  - Since penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae appeared five years ago in
      West Africa and South-east Asia reported cases have doubled annually in Great
      Britain, primarily as a result of increasing importation. Importation of
      penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae has increased exponentially because
      dramatic expansion of these strains in their regions of origin has led to
      increasing infection of male air travellers. From 1977 to 1980 infections
      acquired in Great Britain played only a minor part in the exponential increase.
      During 1981 the number of indigenous cases increased much more rapidly than
      imported cases, indicating that these strains have become truly endemic in Great 
      Britain. Currently, identification of patients at high risk and initial treatment
      with penicillinase-resistant antibiotics offers the best hope of containing the
      strains. The emergence and rapid spread of penicillinase-producing Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae shows the international consequences of the abuse of antibiotics.

TI  - Pneumocephalus as a complication of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      meningitis.
PG  - 140-2
LID - 10.1016/j.ejim.2007.03.021 [doi]
AB  - Pneumocephalus implies air inside the cranial vault, which usually results from
      cranio-facial trauma. Occasionally, meningitis caused by gas-forming organisms
      can result in pneumocephalus. Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis can, on rare
      occasions, cause pneumocephalus as a complication. The drug of choice for K.
      pneumoniae meningitis is a third-generation cephalosporin, and resistance to
      these drugs is unusual. We report a case of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae
      meningitis resulting from chronic suppurative otitis media, which was later
      complicated by pneumocephalus. The patient was successfully managed with
      meropenam and amikacin, the only antibiotics to which these bacilli showed no
      resistance.

TI  - Effects of Reducing Antimicrobial Use and Applying a Cleaning and Disinfection
      Program in Veal Calf Farming: Experiences from an Intervention Study to Control
      Livestock-Associated MRSA.
PG  - e0135826
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135826 [doi]
AB  - With the ultimate aim of containing the emergence of resistant bacteria, a Dutch 
      policy was set in place in 2010 promoting a reduction of antimicrobial use (AMU) 
      in food-producing animals. In this context, a study evaluated strategies to curb 
      livestock-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA).
      Fifty-one veal calf farms were assigned to one of 3 study arms: RAB farms
      reducing antimicrobials by protocol; RAB-CD farms reducing antimicrobials by
      protocol and applying a cleaning and disinfection program; and Control farms
      without interventions. MRSA carriage was tested in week 0 and week 12 of 2
      consecutive production cycles in farmers, family members and veal calves.
      Interventions were validated and a cyclic rise in MRSA-prevalence in animals was 
      shown with a more moderate increase in RAB farms. Prevalence in humans declined
      parallel over time in the study arms but RAB farms were at the lowest MRSA levels
      from the beginning of the study. In RAB-CD farms, human and animal prevalence did
      not differ from Control farms and MRSA air loads were significantly higher than
      in the other study arms. Mimicking the national trend, an overall AMU decrease
      (daily dosages per animal per cycle (DDDA/C)) was observed over 4 pre-study and
      the 2 study cycles; this trend did not have a significant effect on a set of
      evaluated farm technical parameters. AMU was positively associated with MRSA
      across study arms (ORs per 10 DDDA/C increase = 1.26 for both humans (p = 0.07)
      and animals (p = 0.12 in first cycle)). These results suggest that AMU reduction 
      might be a good strategy for curbing MRSA in veal calf farming, however the
      specific cleaning and disinfecting program in RAB-CD farms was not effective. The
      drop in MRSA prevalence in people during the study could be attributed to the
      observed long-term AMU decreasing trend.

AB  - The presence of ESBL/AmpC-producing Escherichia coli in livestock such as pigs
      has been known for some time. However, to date there is little information about 
      the transmission of these resistant bacteria between pig farms and their
      surroundings. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore this topic by
      investigating seven German pig fattening farms. Samples from outside (including
      ground surfaces, ambient air, slurry and digestate from biogas plants) and, in
      parallel, from inside the pig barns (including pig feces, dust, barn air, flies
      and mice feces) were examined for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli and selected
      isolates were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. 14/17
      (82.4%) slurry samples and three of four samples of digestate from biogas plants 
      tested positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. In the vicinity of the pig barns
      these resistant bacteria were detected in 14/87 (16.1%) boot swabs taken from
      various ground surfaces and in 2/36 (6%) ambient air samples. Inside the pig
      barns, 6/63 (9.5%) barn air samples and a small proportion of flies and mice
      feces samples were ESBL/AmpC-positive. PFGE analysis proved fecal emission as
      well as a possible spread via flies, as identical ESBL-E. coli isolates were
      detected in slurry and on fertilized fields, as well as in flies and pooled feces
      from inside the barn and slurry. Contaminated slurry presented the major emission
      source for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in the pig fattening farms, but a spread
      via the airborne route or via different vectors also seems possible.

TI  - Survival of bacteria during aerosolization.
PG  - 3463-7
AB  - One form of commercial application of microorganisms, including genetically
      engineered microorganisms is as an aerosol. To study the effect of
      aerosol-induced stress on bacterial survival, nonrecombinant spontaneous
      antibiotic-resistant mutants of four organisms, Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia
      herbicola, Klebsiella planticola, and Pseudomonas syringae, were sprayed in
      separate experiments in a greenhouse. Samples were collected over a distance of
      15 m from the spray site for enumeration. Spores of Bacillus subtilis were used
      as tracers to estimate the effects of dilution on changes in population over
      distance. Viable counts of P. syringae, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. planticola
      decreased significantly over a distance of 15 m. Erwinia herbicola showed no
      significant decline in counts over the same distance. The degree of survival of
      P. syringae during aerosolization was dependent on ambient environmental
      conditions (i.e., temperature, relative humidity), droplet size of the aerosol,
      and prior preparative conditions. Survival was greatest at high relative
      humidities (70 to 80%) and low temperatures (12 degrees C). Survival was reduced 
      when small droplet sizes were used. The process of washing the cells prior to
      aerosolization also caused a reduction in their survival. Results from these
      experiments will be useful in developing sound methodologies to optimize
      enumeration and for predicting the downwind dispersal of airborne microorganisms,
      including genetically engineered microorganisms.

TI  - New concepts in collectin-mediated host defense at the air-liquid interface of
      the lung.
PG  - S7-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D are collectins that play key roles
      in innate immune defense of the lung. Recent studies suggest that these proteins 
      have a direct effect on the growth and viability of Gram-negative bacteria,
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Histoplasma capsulatum. METHODOLOGY: The researchers
      examined membrane permeabilization by BAL fluid of mice that were sufficient or
      deficient in surfactant proteins, of rough and smooth LPS-containing membranes,
      and of genetically altered bacteria. The permeability assay is based on the
      ability of agents to promote access of impermeable dyes propidium iodide and
      ELF97 to intracellular targets. RESULTS: The permeabilizing activity of
      concentrated BAL material from SP-A+/+ mice was substantially greater than that
      from SP-A-/- animals, and was sensitive to hyperoxic exposure. Oxidation of the
      collectins in vitro also blocked their antimicrobial effects. Rough but not
      smooth LPS conferred susceptibility of model bacterial membranes to
      permeabilization by the collectins. The screening of genetically engineered SP-A 
      mice with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa signature tagged mutagenesis library has
      revealed several pathways which are required for resistance to the permeabilizing
      effects of SP-A, including those required for salicylate biosynthesis and
      flagellar function. CONCLUSION: The researchers conclude that the pulmonary
      collectins directly permeabilize bacteria in an LPS-dependent and rough
      LPS-specific manner. Oxidative damage blocks the permeabilizing activity of
      alveolar lining fluid and purified proteins. The mechanism(s) of permeabilization
      is not known, but the crystal structure of SP-A reveals a hydrophobic cleft lined
      by charged residues which may play a role in membrane perturbation.

TI  - Infected giant bulla treated by percutaneous drainage followed later by
      resection: report of a case.
PG  - 656-9
AB  - A 55-year-old man was hospitalized for treatment of a giant, fluid-filled bulla
      in the upper lobe of the right lung. The infection was resistant to antibiotics, 
      and the resulting drug-induced liver dysfunction prohibited us from performing
      emergency lobectomy. Percutaneous drainage of the bulla was done initially, using
      a 28-Fr chest tube, after which the symptoms of infection improved rapidly.
      Despite a small air leakage, which became evident on day 4 of drainage, shrinkage
      of the bulla was achieved, and elective bullectomy was performed after continuous
      drainage for 21 days. Thus, percutaneous drainage was effective in controlling
      the infection and minimizing the invasiveness of surgery.

TI  - Stimulatory effect of cooling tower biocides on amoebae.
PG  - 3245-9
AB  - Two species of amoebae were isolated from the cooling tower of an
      air-conditioning system and examined for effects of exposure to four cooling
      tower biocides, a thiocarbamate compound, tributyltin neodecanoate mixed with
      quaternary ammonium compounds, another quaternary ammonium compound alone, and an
      isothiazolin derivative. The amoebae isolated were Acanthamoeba hatchetti and a
      Cochliopodium species. Two other amoeba cultures, an A. hatchetti culture and
      Cochliopodium bilimbosum, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
      (ATCC) and were also tested. The cooling tower isolates were more resistant to
      most of the biocides than the ATCC isolates were. The isothiazolin derivative was
      the least inhibitory to all four amoeba isolates, and tributyltin neodecanoate
      mixed with quaternary ammonium compounds was the most inhibitory to three of the 
      four isolates. After exposure to lower concentrations of the biocides, including 
      for one strain the manufacturer's recommended concentration of one biocide, the
      cooling tower amoeba populations increased significantly compared with unexposed 
      controls, whereas the ATCC isolates were not stimulated at any of the
      concentrations tested. In some cases, concentrations which stimulated cooling
      tower amoebae inhibited the growth of the ATCC isolates. These results suggest
      that cooling tower amoebae may adapt to biocides, underscoring the need to use
      freshly isolated cooling tower organisms rather than organisms from culture
      collections for testing the efficacy of such biocides. The stimulatory effect of 
      biocides on amoeba populations is an alarming observation, since these organisms 
      may be reservoirs for legionellae. Biocides used to control microbial growth may 
      actually enhance populations of host organisms for pathogenic bacteria.

TI  - Structures of SAICAR synthetase (PurC) from Streptococcus pneumoniae with ADP,
      Mg2+, AIR and Asp.
PG  - 841-50
LID - 10.1107/S139900471303366X [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a multidrug-resistant pathogen that is a target of
      considerable interest for antibacterial drug development. One strategy for drug
      discovery is to inhibit an essential metabolic enzyme. The seventh step of the de
      novo purine-biosynthesis pathway converts carboxyaminoimidazoleribonucleotide
      (CAIR) and L-aspartic acid (Asp) to 4-(N-succino)-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
      ribonucleotide (SAICAR) in the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) using 
      the enzyme PurC. PurC has been shown to be conditionally essential for bacterial 
      replication. Two crystal structures of this essential enzyme from Streptococcus
      pneumoniae (spPurC) in the presence of adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), Mg(2+),
      aminoimidazoleribonucleotide (AIR) and/or Asp have been obtained. This is the
      first structural study of spPurC, as well as the first of PurC from any species
      with Asp in the active site. Based on these findings, two model structures are
      proposed for the active site with all of the essential ligands (ATP, Mg(2+), Asp 
      and CAIR) present, and a relay mechanism for the formation of the product SAICAR 
      is suggested.

TI  - Food animals and antimicrobials: impacts on human health.
PG  - 718-33
LID - 10.1128/CMR.00002-11 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobials are valuable therapeutics whose efficacy is seriously compromised 
      by the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The provision of
      antibiotics to food animals encompasses a wide variety of nontherapeutic purposes
      that include growth promotion. The concern over resistance emergence and spread
      to people by nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials has led to conflicted practices
      and opinions. Considerable evidence supported the removal of nontherapeutic
      antimicrobials (NTAs) in Europe, based on the "precautionary principle." Still,
      concrete scientific evidence of the favorable versus unfavorable consequences of 
      NTAs is not clear to all stakeholders. Substantial data show elevated antibiotic 
      resistance in bacteria associated with animals fed NTAs and their food products. 
      This resistance spreads to other animals and humans-directly by contact and
      indirectly via the food chain, water, air, and manured and sludge-fertilized
      soils. Modern genetic techniques are making advances in deciphering the
      ecological impact of NTAs, but modeling efforts are thwarted by deficits in key
      knowledge of microbial and antibiotic loads at each stage of the transmission
      chain. Still, the substantial and expanding volume of evidence reporting
      animal-to-human spread of resistant bacteria, including that arising from use of 
      NTAs, supports eliminating NTA use in order to reduce the growing environmental
      load of resistance genes.

TI  - [Exacerbation in asthma: definitions and immunopathology].
PG  - 136-42
AB  - There is no unequivocal definition of exacerbation in asthma. These are defined
      as episodes of increased or aggravated respiratory symptoms or as use of oral
      corticosteroid therapy. Viral infection is the most frequent cause of
      exacerbations. Inflammation during exacerbations is heterogeneous. It may be
      associated with bronchial hypereosinophilia, which is used as a predictive marker
      for exacerbation, and with neutrophilia, which is more resistant to
      corticosteroids. During viral infection, an inappropriate Th1 antiviral
      inflammation develops, associated with the intrinsic Th2 activity that leads to
      an aberrant immune response. Exacerbations secondary to allergen exposure are
      classically described as due to a Th2-type inflammation; but Th1 response also
      seems to play a role. Exposure to air pollutants appears able not only to induce 
      bronchial inflammation but also to potentiate the inflammatory reactions of
      patients with exacerbations.

AB  - Colonization of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in food
      producing animals has public health implications, but intervention targets have
      not yet been identified. In this field study occurrence and dynamics of MRSA in
      veal calves were investigated longitudinally on three farms. Determinants
      generally associated with MRSA carriage, such as environmental exposure and
      antimicrobial use, were explored. In addition, the reliability and
      reproducibility of MRSA detection in nasal samples from veal calves were
      investigated as well as the additional value of rectal samples to establish MRSA 
      status of an individual animal. On these three farms, MRSA prevalence and MRSA
      air loads in stables rapidly increased during the production cycle, especially
      after releasing calves from their individual houses, but not simultaneously with 
      or directly after treatment with antimicrobials. These observations constitute
      the hypothesis that antimicrobial use may not necessarily be the only condition
      for MRSA transmission in veal calves, but indicate that other factors may
      contribute to transmission as well. MRSA in calves was present both nasally and
      rectally. The reproducibility and repeatability of the nasal samples were
      moderate. The results of this study give a better understanding of the dynamics
      of MRSA in a field situation.

TI  - [Microbiological air quality in some kindergartens and antibiotic resistance of
      bacteria of the Staphylococcus spp. genus].
PG  - 49-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological contamination or tne air and the acquisition of the
      antibiotic resistance by pathogenic bacteria is a growing phenomenon that has a
      substantial impact on the quality of our health. This problem applies mainly to
      public areas where we spend a large part of our lives. This study was focused on 
      the microbiological analysis of the air in some kindergartens and antibiotic
      resistance of bacteria of the Stephylococcus spp. genus. The identification of
      the isolated mould fungi has been also made. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Air samples
      were collected from classrooms in the seasonal cycle in the mornings and
      afternoons using 2 methods, sedimentation and impact. Air samples collected
      outside the kindergartens served as controls. Air quality assessments were based 
      on the groups of indicator microorganisms, according to Polish standards. The
      susceptibility of isolated staphylococci was assessed with the disc-diffusion
      method, using 8 different classes of antibiotics, in line with the
      recommendations of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
      (EUCAST). RESULTS: The analyses show that, regardless of the method, the total
      number of heterothropic bacteria and staphylococci in the air of the analyzed
      kindergartens exceeded the allowable limits. There was no air-pollution with the 
      fungal infection. Based on the antibiogram, it was found that Staphylococcus spp.
      strains showed the highest sensitivity to chloramphenicol and the lowest to
      penicillin and gentamicin. Among the fungi moulds of the genus Cladosporium
      predominated. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the analyses highlight the need for
      regular health checks and further research to help identify biological factors
      that may significantly affect the quality of health of people living in public
      spaces.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
      synthesized by chemical reduction method assessment with regard to airborne
      strains of Staphylococcus spp. The first step of the experiment was the
      preparation of silver nanoparticle suspension. The suspension was obtained by a
      fast and simple chemical method involving the reduction of silver ions through a 
      reducing factor in the presence of the suitable stabilizer required to prevent
      the aggregation. In the second stage, varied instrumental techniques were used
      for the analysis and characterization of the obtained nanostructures. Third, the 
      bacteria of the Staphylococcus genus were isolated from the air under stable
      conditions with 47 sports and recreational horses, relatively. Next, isolated
      strains were identified using biochemical and spectrophotometric methods. The
      final step was the evaluation of the Staphylococcus genus sensitivity to
      nanosilver using the disk diffusion test. It has been proven that prepared silver
      nanoparticles exhibit strong antibacterial properties. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration for tested isolates was 30 mug/mL. It has been found that the
      sensitivity of Staphylococcus spp. isolated from six identified species differs
      considerably. The size distribution of bacterial growth inhibition zones
      indicates that resistance to various nanosilver concentrations is an individual
      strain feature, and has no connection with belonging to a specific species.

TI  - Antimicrobial potential of Dialium guineense (Wild.) stem bark on some clinical
      isolates in Nigeria.
PG  - 58-62
LID - 10.4103/2229-516X.96811 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The persistent increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant strains of
      microorganisms has led to the development of more potent but also more expensive 
      antibiotics. In most developing countries of the world these antibiotics are not 
      readily affordable, thus making compliance difficult. This calls for research
      into alternative sources of antimicrobials. Dialium guineense is a shrub of the
      family Leguminosae. Its stem bark is used for the treatment of cough, toothache, 
      and bronchitis. AIMS: Despite the acclaimed efficacy of D guineense, there is no 
      scientific evidence in its support. This work was carried out to assess the
      antimicrobial activity of D guineense in vitro against some clinical isolates.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: D guineense stem bark was collected and 50 gm of air-dried
      and powdered stem bark of the plant was soaked for 72 hours in 1 l of each of the
      six solvents used in this study. Each mixture was refluxed, agitated at 200 rpm
      for 1 hour, filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and, finally, freeze dried.
      The extracts were then tested for antimicrobial activity using the agar diffusion
      method. RESULTS: The highest percentage yield of 23.2% was obtained with ethanol.
      Phytochemical screening showed that D guineense contains anthraquinone,
      alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins. The antimicrobial activity of the
      extracts revealed a broad spectrum of activity, with Salmonella typhi and
      Staphylococcus aureusa showing the greatest zones of inhibition (18.0 mm). Only
      Candida albicans among the fungi tested was inhibited by the extract. The
      greatest zone of inhibition among the fractions was 16.0 mm. D guineense
      exhibited bactericidal activity at the 7th and 9th hours against Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and S. aureus 25923 while the 10th hour against S. typhi and C.
      albicans. The greatest activity was noted against S pneumoniae, where there was
      reduced viable cell count after 6 hours of exposure. CONCLUSION: Stem bark
      extract of D guineense (Wild.) has the potential to be developed into an
      antimicrobial agent.

LID - 10.1016/j.nano.2011.11.007 [doi]
AB  - The increased emergence of drug resistant microbes creates a major challenge to
      the scientific community for successful development of effective therapeutics.
      The antimicrobial activities of silver ions are well known, but limited
      information is available on the effects of green silver-nanoparticles (AgNPs) on 
      human pathogens. In this article, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of
      starch-stabilized AgNPs against a panel of human pathogens commonly associated
      with air, water and food borne infections. The shape and size distribution of
      AgNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. We showed that
      AgNPs were more effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens as
      compared with acid-fast bacteria. AgNPs were not cytotoxic to macrophages at the 
      bactericidal concentration and can augment intracellular killing potential of
      macrophages. Furthermore, we showed that AgNPs disrupt biofilm formation and
      exhibit better antibacterial activity compared to human cationic antimicrobial
      peptide LL-37. In summary, our data suggest AgNPs as a promising template for the
      design of novel antibacterial agents.

TI  - Effect of arbekacin on a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced
      biofilm in a rat model.
PG  - 268-73
AB  - Biofilms are a major concern for clinicians in the treatment of infectious
      disease because of their resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Arbekacin, an
      aminoglycoside antibiotic, is the drug of choice for the treatment of infection
      caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, it has not
      yet been defined whether arbekacin tends to penetrate into the biofilm structure 
      induced by MRSA infection. In this study, we treated a biofilm mode of MRSA
      growth with arbekacin, using a rat air-pouch model. The model has the advantage
      of permitting frequent sampling of exudates for bacterial counts and
      antibacterial activity. A clear dose-dependent bactericidal effect was detected
      in rats treated with arbekacin at concentrations between 0.3 and 10 mg/kg, but
      0.1 mg/kg of arbekacin was ineffective against the experimental MRSA infection in
      rats. Morphological studies using scanning electron microscopy and histochemical 
      staining demonstrated that an effective dosage of arbekacin induced dramatic
      changes in the biofilm membranous structure as well as in the inflammatory
      response, resulting in eradication of the biofilm structure and resolution of
      inflammation.

AB  - Although previous studies have demonstrated high carriage of ESBL/AmpC-producing 
      Escherichia coli in livestock, especially in broiler chickens, data on emission
      sources of these bacteria into the environment are still rare. Therefore, this
      study was designed to systematically investigate the occurrence of
      ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry, air (inside animal houses), ambient air
      (outside animal houses) and on soil surfaces in the areas surrounding of seven
      ESBL/AmpC-positive broiler chicken fattening farms, including investigation of
      the possible spread of these bacteria via the faecal route and/or exhaust air
      into the environment. Seven German broiler fattening farms were each investigated
      at three points in time (3-36 h after restocking, 14-18 and 26-35 days after
      housing) during one fattening period. The occurrence of ESBL/AmpC genes in the
      investigated samples was confirmed by PCR, detecting blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM and
      blaCMY-genes, and, if necessary, by sequencing and/or the disc diffusion method. 
      The results showed a wide spread of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in broiler farms,
      as well as emissions into the surroundings. 12 out of 14 (86%) slurry samples
      were positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. Additionally, 28.8% (n=23/80) of
      boot swabs taken from various surfaces in the areas surrounding of the farms as
      well as 7.5% (n=3/40) of the exhaust air samples turned out to be positive for
      these microorganisms. Moreover, a small proportion of air samples from inside the
      barns were ESBL/AmpC-positive. By comparing selected isolates using pulsed field 
      gel electrophoresis, we proved that faecal and airborne transfer of
      ESBL/AmpC-producing microorganisms from broiler fattening farms to the
      surrounding areas is possible. Two isolates from farm G2 (slurry and boot swab 50
      m downwind), two isolates from farm G3 (slurry and individual animal swab) as
      well as two isolates from farm G6 (air sample in the barn and air sample 50 m
      downwind) showed 100% similarity in PFGE analysis.

AB  - Bacterial infections decreased considerably after the discovery of antibiotics.
      Nevertheless, because of the rising rate of infections caused by
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains, the search for new bactericidal agents has
      again become a crucial topic in clinical medicine. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP)
      have a huge potential in dermatology and wound care management because of their
      ability to release silver ions (Ag(+) ions) in a prolonged and sustained way.
      However, negative effects of silver on the patient's cells should not be
      underestimated. Furthermore, it has been controversially discussed whether AgNP
      are responsible for nanoparticle-specific outcomes or not. In this study, we
      investigated the effects of AgNP on human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) in order to 
      better understand the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and to improve the use of this
      highly reactive biocide in wound healing. We found that most of the cells with
      internalized AgNP displayed the typical morphological signs of apoptosis. The
      cell viability assay (XTT) showed concentration-dependent toxic effects of the
      AgNP toward HaCaT cells. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced 
      by AgNP was investigated in cell suspensions by means of electron paramagnetic
      resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In order to distinguish between the effects of
      Ag(+) ions released during AgNP storage and those of Ag(+) ions released after
      nanoparticle application, we compared AgNP stored under air (O2) with AgNP stored
      under argon (Ar). Dispersions of AgNP stored under Ar have a low content of Ag(+)
      ions because of the absence of oxygen which is needed for oxidative dissolution. 
      The results show that Ag(+) ions released during particle storage are responsible
      for most of the ROS produced during 1h incubation with the cells. AgNP (Ar) also 
      induced intracellular ROS but to a much smaller extent compared to AgNP (O2).
      These findings highlight the complexity of experiments to assess the toxicity of 
      AgNP and suggest the possibility of reducing AgNP toxic effects by storing AgNP
      formulations and even silver-containing wound dressing under an inert gas
      atmosphere.

PG  - 40-2
AB  - Efficient monitoring of antimicrobial resistance (AR) can produce timely and
      important data and information that will benefit patients and could assist in the
      detection of a bioterrorist event. The microbiology laboratory staff of the
      largest U.S. Air Force medical facility attempted to improve AR monitoring at
      their hospital by reviewing their current capabilities and the capabilities of
      other available monitoring systems. The systems reviewed included the DataTrac
      System (Vitek bioMerieux, Hazelwood, Missouri) and the military Composite Health 
      Care System, which were already in use, and the WHONET 5 (World Health
      Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) and The Surveillance Network (MRL
      Pharmaceutical Services, Herndon, Virginia). The Surveillance Network was
      selected for incorporation into the hospital AR monitoring program with
      modifications to comply with military command requirements. Information gathered 
      during the review and selection process are presented and may be helpful to
      others who are looking to improve their hospital AR monitoring programs.

      DNA minor groove alkylators.

AB  - Hypoxia represents an important therapeutic target in tumors because of the
      resistance of hypoxic cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and because it is
      more severe in many tumors than in normal tissues. Here, we describe a class of
      prodrugs, nitro-chloromethylindolines, which undergo hypoxia-selective activation
      by endogenous nitroreductases in tumor cells to form the corresponding amino
      compounds. The latter are chemically related to the cyclopropylindoline antitumor
      antibiotics and they share the same properties of sequence-selective DNA minor
      groove alkylation and high cytotoxic potency. Of three alkylating subunits
      investigated, the chloromethylbenzindoline (CBI) structure provided the most
      favorable prodrug properties: aerobic cytotoxic potency of the amines was
      approximately 90- to 3,000-fold higher than the corresponding nitro compounds,
      and the nitro compounds showed air/anoxia potency differentials of up to
      300-fold. Selective alkylation of adenine N3 in calf thymus DNA by an amino-CBI
      was shown by characterization of the thermal depurination product; the same
      adduct was shown in hypoxic RIF-1 cells exposed to the corresponding nitro-CBI
      prodrug under hypoxic (but not oxic) conditions. The amino metabolite generated
      from a nitro-CBI by cells expressing Escherichia coli nfsB nitroreductase in
      multicellular layer cultures was shown to elicit bystander killing of surrounding
      cells. Nitro-CBI prodrugs were >500-fold less toxic to mice than amino-CBIs by
      i.p. administration and provided selective killing of hypoxic cells in RIF-1
      tumors (although only at maximally tolerated doses). Nitro-CBIs are novel lead
      hypoxia-activated prodrugs that represent the first examples of hypoxia-selective
      generation of potent DNA minor groove alkylating agents.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will discuss recent studies of the virulence of
      cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens, including epidemic strains, a more complex
      understanding of droplet transmission, bacterial contamination of CF clinics, and
      identifying and overcoming barriers to implementation of infection control
      guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: Both morbidity and mortality are associated with
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thus, clinicians are
      attempting eradication strategies for MRSA using combinations of oral,
      aerosolized, intravenous, and topical antibiotics, with some success. However,
      household contacts may be colonized with MRSA, which can impact the durability of
      eradication. Epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also associated with 
      increased morbidity and mortality and some clones are detected in CF patients
      throughout the world presumably due to social networks among patients. Recent
      experimental and clinical data have suggested that CF patients can generate
      droplet nuclei in the respirable range and that infectious particles can be
      cultured from room air minutes to hours after patients have left. SUMMARY:
      Although these observations regarding droplet nuclei have not been linked to
      transmission, they do challenge the safety of the '3-foot rule' and suggest the
      potential role of masks. Additional research is needed to develop strategies to
      improve infection control practices among healthcare professionals, CF patients, 
      and families.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Research into the distribution of bioaerosols during events
      associated with huge groups of people is lacking, especially in developing
      countries. The purpose of this study was to understand the distribution pattern
      of bioaerosols during an annual trade fair in the historical city of Gwalior,
      central India, a very important historical fair that was started by the King of
      Gwalior Maharaja Madho Rao in 1905. METHODS: Air samples were collected from six 
      different sites at the fair ground and three different sites in a residential
      area before/during/after the fair using an impactor sampler on microbial content 
      test agar and rose bengal agar for total bacteria and fungi, respectively. The
      representative strains of bacteria and fungi were further identified and selected
      bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing according
      to US Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The
      bacterial bioaerosol count [colony-forming units (CFU)/m(3)] at fair sites was
      found to be 9.0 x 10(3), 4.0 x 10(4), and 1.0 x 10(4) before the start of the
      fair, during the fair, and after the fair, respectively. The fungal bioaerosol
      count at fair sites was 2.6 x 10(3) CFU/m(3), 6.3 x 10(3) CFU/m(3), and 1.7 x
      10(3) CFU/m(3) before the fair, during the fair, and after the fair,
      respectively. Bacterial/fungal bioaerosols during-fair were increased
      significantly from the bacterial/fungal bioaerosols of the before-fair period (p 
      < 0.05); they were also significantly higher than the bacterial/fungal
      bioaerosols at non-fair sites during the event (p < 0.0001). The proportion of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria over the fair ground was significantly increased
      during-fair and was still higher in the after-fair period. Methicillin-resistant 
      staphylococci (MRS) were also reported at the fair ground. CONCLUSION: The study 
      indicates significantly higher bacterial and fungal bioaerosols during the fair
      event. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the health aspects and
      guidelines to control microbial load during such types of events.

AB  - Understanding the microbial community structure and genetic potential of anode
      biofilms is key to improve extracellular electron transfers in microbial fuel
      cells. We investigated effect of substrate and temporal dynamics of anodic
      biofilm communities using phylogenetic and metagenomic approaches in parallel
      with electrochemical characterizations. The startup non-steady state anodic
      bacterial structures were compared for a simple substrate, acetate, and for a
      complex substrate, landfill leachate, using a single-chamber air-cathode
      microbial fuel cell. Principal coordinate analysis showed that distinct community
      structures were formed with each substrate type. The bacterial diversity measured
      as Shannon index decreased with time in acetate cycles, and was restored with the
      introduction of leachate. The change of diversity was accompanied by an opposite 
      trend in the relative abundance of Geobacter-affiliated phylotypes, which were
      acclimated to over 40% of total Bacteria at the end of acetate-fed conditions
      then declined in the leachate cycles. The transition from acetate to leachate
      caused a decrease in output power density from 243+/-13 mW/m2 to 140+/-11 mW/m2, 
      accompanied by a decrease in Coulombic electron recovery from 18+/-3% to 9+/-3%. 
      The leachate cycles selected protein-degrading phylotypes within phylum
      Synergistetes. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing showed that leachate-fed
      communities had higher cell motility genes including bacterial chemotaxis and
      flagellar assembly, and increased gene abundance related to metal resistance,
      antibiotic resistance, and quorum sensing. These differentially represented genes
      suggested an altered anodic biofilm community in response to additional
      substrates and stress from the complex landfill leachate.

PG  - 874-81
AB  - Coatings of quaternary ammonium tertiary structures (QUATS) copolymerized with
      4-vinylbenzylthymine (VBT) exhibited high antimicrobial activity against
      Escherichia coli. Immobilization of QUATS improves environmental performance by
      preventing release of antibacterials to the environment, helping to preclude the 
      emergence of resistant strains. The crosslinking immobilization scheme reported
      herein provides a more environmentally benign and more inexpensive synthesis than
      previously reported, thus reducing the use of solvents, energy, and production
      time. Development of water soluble, thymine-based photopolymers was inspired by
      the UV-induced 2pi + 2pi photocyclodimerization of thymine in DNA. Copolymers of 
      4-vinylbenzylthymine and trimethylammonium chloride, triethylammonium chloride,
      or dimethyloctylammonium chloride were synthesized in different monomer ratios.
      The antibacterial properties were tested by coating VBT:QUATS in sterilized petri
      dishes, crosslinking under short UV light, spraying with aqueous suspensions of
      bacterial cells, air drying, and then applying agar media to promote bacterial
      growth. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The number of viable 
      cells ranged from 17 to 0% growth. Immobilized VBT:QUAT copolymers are antiseptic
      surfaces that can be produced in an environmentally benign fashion.

AB  - A new approach for fabrication of a long-term and recoverable antimicrobial
      nanostructure/textile hybrid without increasing the antimicrobial resistance is
      demonstrated. Using in situ synthesized Ag nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on ZnO
      nanowires (NWs) grown on textiles by a 'dip-in and light-irradiation' green
      chemical method, we obtained ZnONW@AgNP nanocomposites with small-size and
      uniform Ag NPs, which have shown superior performance for antibacterial
      applications. These new Ag/ZnO/textile antimicrobial composites can be used for
      wound dressings and medical textiles for topical and prophylactic antibacterial
      treatments, point-of-use water treatment to improve the cleanliness of water and 
      antimicrobial air filters to prevent bioaerosols accumulating in ventilation,
      heating, and air-conditioning systems.

      This study sought to determine if Ionic Breeze air purifiers are effective in
      collecting and destroying bacteria found in dental aerosols (such as
      Staphylococcus aureus). This study placed one Sharper Image Professional Series
      Ionic Breeze Quadra unit and one Ionic Breeze GP unit (with germicidal
      protection) in dental operatories within the Louisiana State University School of
      Dentistry. After six hours of operation, bacterial samples were collected and
      streaked over surfaces of petri dishes containing trypticase soy sucrose
      bacitracin agar that had been supplemented with 5% sheep blood. The samples were 
      incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours; at that point, the microbial colonies
      were counted. Additional testing was performed on suspect colonies to identify S.
      aureus strains and to determine if any of those isolates were pathogenic with or 
      without antibiotic resistance. The Ionic Breeze GP unit killed more than 99% of
      all bacteria on the stainless steel collecting blades. The non-germicidal Ionic
      Breeze Quadra air purifier collected numerous bacteria that were found to include
      some pathogenic strains of S. aureus; however, none of these were resistant to
      antibiotics.

      airway cells.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Although Pneumocystis jirovecii is a well-known and serious pathogen,
      all previous attempts to isolate, cultivate, and propagate this fungus have
      failed. This serious challenge in microbiology was addressed in the present
      study. We examined whether P. jirovecii could be cultured in a permanent
      three-dimensional air-liquid interface culture system formed by CuFi-8 cells, a
      differentiated pseudostratified airway epithelial cell line. Cultured
      pseudostratified cells were inoculated with bronchoalveolar fluid that had been
      confirmed to be positive for P. jirovecii using PCR. Five days later, the cells
      and basal medium were harvested and tested for P. jirovecii using quantitative
      PCR (qPCR), commercially available immunofluorescence detection assays, and
      Grocott staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded thin sections of
      infected-cell cultures. We successfully productively cultivated and propagated P.
      jirovecii from these P. jirovecii-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
      samples. Furthermore, we provide evidence that P. jirovecii induced cytopathic
      effects on lung epithelial cells and was even invasive in cell culture. To the
      best of our knowledge, the cell culture system developed herein represents the
      first methodology to enable molecular analyses of this pathogen's life cycle and 
      further in vitro studies of P. jirovecii, such as assessments of drug sensitivity
      and resistance as well as investigations of the pathogen's stability against
      environmental factors and disinfectants. IMPORTANCE: This is the first report of 
      the successful productive cultivation and propagation of Pneumocystis jirovecii, 
      a human-pathogenic fungus of major clinical significance. These findings are
      groundbreaking because they will influence the field of diagnostic microbiology, 
      facilitate the testing of antibiotics against P. jirovecii, and enable stability 
      studies of this pathogen when exposed to the environmental factors and chemicals 
      that hospitals are required to use for disinfection. Because productively
      culturing P. jirovecii has been attempted unsuccessfully for several decades,
      this study represents a breakthrough in this field.

TI  - Treatment options in emerging mold infections.
PG  - 473-9
AB  - Although Zygomycetes, Fusarium spp, and Scedosporium spp are far less frequent
      causes of invasive fungal disease than Aspergillus and Candida, they are
      emerging. These types of infections in severely immunocompromised patients have a
      common feature: a poor clinical response to antifungal therapy. Infection is
      usually airborne, although local infections in cases of skin trauma are also
      possible. These fungi are resistant to some common antifungal agents; therefore, 
      surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue, when possible, should be combined
      with specific systemic antifungal treatment in immunocompromised patients. In the
      absence of randomized clinical trials, most experience in the treatment of these 
      infections is with amphotericin B. Experience with new antifungal agents is still
      limited, and recovery from neutropenia remains the main predictor of a favorable 
      outcome.

TI  - Affordability and Obesity: Issues in the Multifunctionality of Agricultural/Food 
      Systems.
PG  - 454-465
AB  - The conference discussed public goods and externalities created as byproducts of 
      the food system, including local development, obesity, air and water pollution,
      climate change, antibiotic resistance, and other public health issues.
      Multifunctionality is a framework that integrates these diverse issues and has
      been influential in international policy. This commentary focuses on arguably the
      most prominent public health issue at the moment: obesity. While obesity could be
      considered another multifunctional dimension, its link to other conference topics
      are tenuous. Using obesity as an argument to promote local produce or achieve
      other multifunctional outcomes is very questionable. Framing obesity as an issue 
      of poverty or food insecurity trivializes the continuing major problem of hunger 
      worldwide.

TI  - An outbreak of post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis caused by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa.
PG  - 2321-6.e1-4
LID - 10.1016/j.ophtha.2009.06.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infectious endophthalmitis is among the most serious complications of 
      cataract surgery. Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are
      responsible for less than 30% of cases; however, their rapidity of infection and 
      virulence often results in poor visual outcome despite prompt antibiotic
      treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate an outbreak of
      post-cataract surgery P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis in India. DESIGN:
      Hospital-based case series. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients with acute
      postoperative endophthalmitis who underwent cataract surgery at one of the
      peripheral centers of Joseph Eye Hospital, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India,
      from February 23 to April 2, 2008. INTERVENTIONS: Vitreous aspirates and
      environmental surveillance specimens were inoculated for culture. Antibiotic
      susceptibility testing was performed by agar diffusion method. Polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)
      primers (ERIC-PCR) was used to establish the clonal relationship between clinical
      and environmental isolates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Post-cataract surgery P.
      aeruginosa endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 20 
      eyes with postoperative endophthalmitis, the phacoemulsifier's internal tubes,
      the povidone-iodine solution, and the operating theater air-conditioning system. 
      All strains were multidrug-resistant to cefazolin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline,
      aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones; conversely, most of them were susceptible 
      to polymyxin B. Polymerase chain reaction with enterobacterial repetitive
      intergenic consensus primers disclosed 2 major clusters: six genetically
      identical clinical isolates shared 94% of similarity with the air-conditioning
      isolate; 11 other clinical isolates had 88% of similarity with the former strain.
      Despite the prompt use of intravitreal antibiotics, 10 patients had evisceration 
      or phthisis of the affected eye. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of cataract
      surgery-related P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis is poor. The detection of
      multidrug-resistant isolates is a serious problem, jeopardizing an appropriate
      choice of treatment. Polymerase chain reaction with enterobacterial repetitive
      intergenic consensus results strongly suggest that the main source of infection
      in this outbreak was the contaminated air-conditioning system. Polymerase chain
      reaction with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus is an inexpensive, 
      fast, reproducible, and discriminatory DNA typing tool for effective
      epidemiologic surveillance of clinical and environmental isolates of P.
      aeruginosa.

TI  - Methanol may function as a cross-kingdom signal.
PG  - e36122
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0036122 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we demonstrated that leaf wounding results in the synthesis of pectin
      methylesterase (PME), which causes the plant to release methanol into the air.
      Methanol emitted by a wounded plant increases the accumulation of
      methanol-inducible gene mRNA and enhances antibacterial resistance as well as
      cell-to-cell communication, which facilitates virus spreading in neighboring
      plants. We concluded that methanol is a signaling molecule involved in
      within-plant and plant-to-plant communication. Methanol is considered to be a
      poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion
      of methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, recent data showed that methanol is
      a natural compound in normal, healthy humans. These data call into question
      whether human methanol is a metabolic waste product or whether methanol has
      specific function in humans. Here, to reveal human methanol-responsive genes
      (MRGs), we used suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries of HeLa
      cells lacking ADH and exposed to methanol. This design allowed us to exclude
      genes involved in formaldehyde and formic acid detoxification from our analysis. 
      We identified MRGs and revealed a correlation between increases in methanol
      content in the plasma and changes in human leukocyte MRG mRNA levels after fresh 
      salad consumption by volunteers. Subsequently, we showed that the methanol
      generated by the pectin/PME complex in the gastrointestinal tract of mice induces
      the up- and downregulation of brain MRG mRNA. We used an adapted Y-maze to
      measure the locomotor behavior of the mice while breathing wounded plant vapors
      in two-choice assays. We showed that mice prefer the odor of methanol to other
      plant volatiles and that methanol changed MRG mRNA accumulation in the mouse
      brain.We hypothesize that the methanol emitted by wounded plants may have a role 
      in plant-animal signaling. The known positive effect of plant food intake on
      human health suggests a role for physiological methanol in human gene regulation.

TI  - The pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: its relevance to developing 
      effective strategies for prevention.
PG  - 725-39; discussion 739-41
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in 
      the intensive care unit and is associated with major morbidity and attributable
      mortality. Strategies to prevent VAP are likely to be successful only if based
      upon a sound understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiology. The major route for 
      acquiring endemic VAP is oropharyngeal colonization by the endogenous flora or by
      pathogens acquired exogenously from the intensive care unit environment,
      especially the hands or apparel of health-care workers, contaminated respiratory 
      equipment, hospital water, or air. The stomach represents a potential site of
      secondary colonization and reservoir of nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli.
      Endotracheal-tube biofilm formation may play a contributory role in sustaining
      tracheal colonization and also have an important role in late-onset VAP caused by
      resistant organisms. Aspiration of microbe-laden oropharyngeal, gastric, or
      tracheal secretions around the cuffed endotracheal tube into the normally sterile
      lower respiratory tract results in most cases of endemic VAP. In contrast,
      epidemic VAP is most often caused by contamination of respiratory therapy
      equipment, bronchoscopes, medical aerosols, water (eg, Legionella) or air (eg,
      Aspergillus or the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus). Strategies to
      eradicate oropharyngeal and/or intestinal microbial colonization, such as with
      chlorhexidine oral care, prophylactic aerosolization of antimicrobials, selective
      aerodigestive mucosal antimicrobial decontamination, or the use of sucralfate
      rather than H(2) antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and measures to
      prevent aspiration, such as semirecumbent positioning or continuous subglottic
      suctioning, have all been shown to reduce the risk of VAP. Measures to prevent
      epidemic VAP include rigorous disinfection of respiratory equipment and
      bronchoscopes, and infection-control measures to prevent contamination of medical
      aerosols. Hospital water should be Legionella-free, and high-risk patients,
      especially those with prolonged granulocytopenia or organ transplants, should be 
      cared for in hospital units with high-efficiency-particulate-arrestor (HEPA)
      filtered air. Routine surveillance of VAP, to track endemic VAPs and facilitate
      early detection of outbreaks, is mandatory.

TI  - Antibiotics are not needed during tube thoracostomy for spontaneous pneumothorax:
      an observational case study.
PG  - 43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics following tube thoracostomy
      remains controversial in the literature. In this study, we aimed to investigate
      the consequences of closed tube thoracostomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax
      without the use of antibiotics. METHODS: One-hundred and nineteen patients
      underwent tube thoracostomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. None of them
      received prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Eight patients with prolonged air
      leak undergoing either video assisted thoracoscopic surgery or thoracotomy were
      excluded. RESULTS: Of the remaining 111 (104 male and 7 female), 28 (25%)
      patients developed some induration around the entry site of chest tube that
      settled without further treatment. White blood cell count was high without any
      other evidence of infection in 12 (11%) patients and returned to its normal
      levels before discharge home in all. There was also some degree of fever not
      lasting for more than 48 hours in 8 (7%) patients. Bacterial cultures from
      suspected sites did not reveal any significant growth in these patients.
      CONCLUSION: Prophylactic antibiotic treatment seems avoidable during closed tube 
      thoracostomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. This policy was not only
      cost-effective but also prevented our patients from detrimental properties of
      unnecessary antibiotic use, such as development of drug resistance and
      undesirable side effects.

TI  - Formation of bimolecular membranes from lipid monolayers and a study of their
      electrical properties.
PG  - 3561-6
AB  - Bimolecular membranes are formed from two lipid monolayers at an air-water
      interface by the apposition of their hydrocarbon chains when an aperture in a
      Teflon partition separating two aqueous phases is lowered through the interface. 
      Formation of the membrane is monitored by an increase of the electrical capacity,
      as measured with a voltage clamp. Electrical resistance of the unmodified
      membrane is analogous to that of conventional planar bilayers (black lipid
      membranes) prepared in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent, i.e., 10(6)-10(8)
      ohm cm(2); the resistance can be lowered to values of 10(3) ohm cm(2) by
      gramicidin, an antibiotic that modifies the conductance only when the membranes
      are of biomolecular thickness. In contrast to the resistance, there is a
      significant difference between the capacity of bilayers made from mono-layers and
      that of hydrocarbon-containing bilayers made by phase transition; the average
      values are 0.9 and 0.45 muF cm(-2), respectively. The value of 0.9 muF cm(-2)
      approximates that of biological membranes. Assuming a dielectric constant of 2.1 
      for the hydrocarbon region, the dielectric thickness, as calculated from a
      capacity of 0.9 muF cm(-2), is 22 A. This value is 6-10 A smaller than the actual
      thickness of the hydrocarbon region of bilayers and cell membranes, as determined
      by x-ray diffraction. The difference may be due to a limited penetration of water
      into the hydrocarbon region near the ester groups that would lower the electrical
      resistance of this region and reduce the dielectric thickness. Asymmetric
      membranes have been formed by adjoining two lipid monolayers of different
      chemical composition.

TI  - Clinical and microbial efficacy of antimicrobial treatments of experimental avian

PG  - 422-9
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.11.033 [doi]
AB  - The clinical and microbial efficacy of antimicrobial treatments of avian
      colibacillosis was studied, using an experimental model on chickens previously
      inoculated with multiresistant commensal Escherichia coli strains. One E. coli
      with pMG252 plasmid containing bla(FOX5) and qnrA1 genes and another E. coli with
      pMG298 plasmid containing bla(CTX-M15) and qnrB1 genes were first orally
      inoculated to chickens Both isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol,
      sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and
      tetracycline. The birds were then experimentally infected with an avian
      pathogenic E. coli (APEC), via the air sac. Treatments (oxytetracycline (OTC),
      trimethoprim-sulfadimethoxin (SXT), amoxicillin (AMX) or enrofloxacin (ENR) were 
      then offered at the therapeutic doses. Symptoms, lesions in dead or sacrificed
      birds, and isolation and characterization of APEC from internal organs were
      studied. Results showed that OTC, SXT or ENR treatments could control the
      pathology. AMX worsened the disease, possibly due to endotoxin shock. All APEC
      re-isolated from internal organs showed the same antimicrobial susceptibility as 
      the APEC inoculated strain, except for one APEC isolate from an infected
      OTC-treated bird, which acquired tetracycline resistance only, and one APEC
      isolate recovered from the air sacs of a chicken in the infected SXT-treated
      group, which acquired the pMG252 plasmid and became multi-resistant. Thus three
      antimicrobials could control the disease but the experimental model enabled, to
      our knowledge, the first observation of plasmid transfer from a bacterium of the 
      intestinal tract to a pathogenic isolate from the respiratory tract.

TI  - Simplified method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria.
PG  - 444-52
AB  - A simple, abbreviated broth dilution test (tube test) utilizing a commercially
      available medium and inexpensive disposable materials, and which could be
      performed entirely in room air, was developed and used to test the susceptibility
      of 100 strains of anaerobic bacteria to clindamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin,
      and tetracycline. Results are reported in categories of susceptibility:
      susceptible to concentrations surpassed in vivo with usual dosage, susceptible to
      concentrations surpassed in vivo with high dosage, and resistant to
      concentrations achievable in vivo. Results are compared to minimal inhibitory
      concentrations which were determined simultaneously by using a microdilution
      method in an anaerobic glove box. Twenty strains of Bacteroides fragilis, 10
      strains of Fusobacterium, 20 strains of Clostridium, 10 strains of gram-positive 
      non-sporeforming bacilli, and 30 strains of cocci grew to visible turbidity
      within 1 day of incubation. Of the 360 antibiotic-organism combinations tested,
      98% were in a susceptibility category that corresponded (within one
      concentration) to the actual minimal inhibitory concentration as determined by
      the microdilution method. After 2 days of incubation, growth was more abundant,
      but results often indicated inappropriate degrees of resistance. Variation in
      inoculum size had little effect on results. Ten strains of B. melaninogenicus did
      not grow enough for susceptibility to be categorized accurately. The tube test
      could be used in any clinical microbiology laboratory for a limited number of
      susceptibility tests on anaerobic bacteria other than B. melaninogenicus without 
      preparation of special media or purchase of special equipment.

TI  - Surface-mediated release of a small-molecule modulator of bacterial biofilm
      formation: a non-bactericidal approach to inhibiting biofilm formation in
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
PG  - 993-1000
LID - 10.1002/adhm.201200334 [doi]
AB  - We report an approach to preventing bacterial biofilm formation that is based on 
      the surface-mediated release of 5,6-dimethyl-2-aminobenzimidazole (DMABI), a
      potent and non-bactericidal small-molecule inhibitor of bacterial biofilm growth.
      Our results demonstrate that DMABI can be encapsulated in thin films of a model
      biocompatible polymer [poly(lactide-co-glycolide), PLG] and be released in
      quantities that inhibit the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by up to
      75-90% on surfaces that otherwise support robust biofilm growth. This approach
      enables the release of this new anti-biofilm agent for over one month, and it can
      be used to inhibit biofilm growth on both film-coated surfaces and other adjacent
      surfaces (e.g., on other uncoated surfaces and at air/water interfaces). Our
      results demonstrate a non-bactericidal approach to the prevention of biofilm
      growth and provide proof of concept using a clinically relevant human pathogen.
      In contrast to coatings designed to kill bacteria on contact, this approach
      should also permit the design of strategically placed depots that disseminate
      DMABI more broadly and exert inhibitory effects over larger areas. In a broader
      context, the non-bactericidal nature of DMABI could also provide opportunities to
      address concerns related to evolved resistance that currently face approaches
      based on the release of traditional microbicidal agents (e.g., antibiotics).
      Finally, the results of initial in vitro mammalian cell culture studies indicate 
      that DMABI is not toxic to cells at concentrations required for strong
      anti-biofilm activity, suggesting that this new agent is well suited for further 
      investigation in biomedical and personal care contexts.

TI  - Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in glacier environments.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes are biologically transmitted from microorganism to
      microorganism in particular micro-environments where dense microbial communities 
      are often exposed to an intensive use of antibiotics, such as intestinal
      microflora, and the soil microflora of agricultural fields. However, recent
      studies have detected antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or antibiotic resistance 
      genes in the natural environment geographically isolated from such areas. Here we
      sought to examine the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in 54 snow and
      ice samples collected from the Arctic, Antarctic, Central Asia, North and South
      America and Africa, to evaluate the level of these genes in environments
      supposedly not affected by anthropogenic factors. We observed a widespread
      distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in samples from various glaciers in
      Central Asia, North and South America, Greenland and Africa. In contrast,
      Antarctic glaciers were virtually free from these genes. Antibiotic resistance
      genes, of both clinical (i.e. aac(3), blaIMP) and agricultural (i.e. strA and
      tetW) origin, were detected. Our results show regional geographical distribution 
      of antibiotic resistance genes, with the most plausible modes of transmission
      through airborne bacteria and migrating birds.

      polyurethane.
PG  - 1498-506
LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2011.12.027 [doi]
AB  - An N-halamine precursor, 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH), was covalently linked to
      the surface of polyurethane (PU) with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the
      coupling agent. The reaction pathways were investigated using propyl isocyanate
      (PI) as a model compound. The results suggested that the imide and amide groups
      of DMH have very similar reactivities toward the isocyanate groups on PU surfaces
      activated with HDI. After bleach treatment the covalently bound DMH moieties were
      transformed into N-halamines. The new N-halamine-based PU provided potent
      antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium),
      Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacterium), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA, drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterium), vancomycin-resistant
      Enterococcus faecium (VRE, drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterium), and Candida
      albicans (fungus), and successfully prevented bacterial and fungal biofilm
      formation. The antimicrobial and biofilm controlling effects were stable for
      longer than 6 months under normal storage in open air. Furthermore, if the
      functions were lost due to prolonged use they could be recharged by another
      chlorination treatment. The recharging could be repeated as needed to achieve
      long-term protection against microbial contamination and biofilm formation.

TI  - A clone of coagulase-negative staphylococci among patients with post-cardiac
      surgery infections.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are important causes of hospital-acquired
      infections such as infections after cardiac surgery. Efforts to reduce these
      infections are hampered by the lack of knowledge concerning the epidemiology of
      CoNS in this setting. Forty strains of CoNS collected during the surgical
      revision of 27 patients operated on between 1997 and 2000 were analysed. Strains 
      were also collected from the ambient air in the operating suite. Their
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) characteristics and antibiotic resistance
      were analysed. Using PFGE 19 of 40 strains from 15 of 27 patients were shown to
      belong to one clone, and strains from this clone were also isolated from the
      ambient air. This clone had caused infections throughout the period. Antibiotic
      resistance did not correlate with PFGE patterns. Using PFGE one clone could be
      identified that caused 56% of the CoNS infections during this period. A strain
      from this clone was also found in the air of the operating suite suggesting the
      origin of the CoNS causing infections was the hospital environment.

TI  - Aerial exposure to the bacterial volatile compound trimethylamine modifies
      antibiotic resistance of physically separated bacteria by raising culture medium 
      pH.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Bacteria release a wide diversity of small bioactive molecules that
      often correspond to secondary metabolites. Among them, volatile molecules
      produced under various growth conditions were shown to mediate cross-kingdom
      interactions with plants, nematodes, and fungi. Although the role of volatile
      compounds in bacterial biology is not well understood, recent reports indicated
      that they could play a role in airborne interactions between bacteria and
      influence antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence. In this study,
      we investigated long-distance effects of 14 previously described Escherichia coli
      volatile compounds upon the bacteria E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis. We show that several of these
      molecules constitute chemical cues influencing growth, adhesion, and motility in 
      exposed bacteria. Moreover, we show that aerial exposure to trimethylamine (TMA),
      a volatile compound produced in animal intestines and tissues upon biogenic
      reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), modifies the antibiotic resistance
      profiles of all tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We demonstrate
      that the TMA mode of action is distinct from that previously described for
      ammonia and results from nonspecific transient alteration of antibiotic uptake
      due to pH increase in the environment of bacteria aerially exposed to TMA. Our
      study therefore presents a new way by which volatile compounds can affect
      community behavior and structure in physically separated bacteria. It further
      demonstrates that bacterial gases and volatile compounds mediate chemical
      interactions, triggering functional responses that play an important role in the 
      development of bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE: Bacteria release many different
      volatile compounds during food transformation and fermentation. Here we sought to
      investigate the role of several bacterial volatile molecules released by
      Escherichia coli during long-distance airborne interactions with other bacteria. 
      While several tested volatiles affect bacterial motility and surface adhesion, we
      show that aerial exposure to trimethylamine, a molecule produced by E. coli and
      many other Gram-negative bacteria in animal intestines and infected tissues, also
      modulates antibiotic resistance in all tested bacteria. We demonstrate that
      exposure to trimethylamine increases the pH of the growth medium of exposed
      bacteria, resulting in modifications in antibiotic uptake and transient
      alteration of antibiotic resistance. Our study therefore presents a new mechanism
      by which volatile compounds can affect community behavior and structure in
      physically separated bacteria, and it illustrates how airborne chemical
      interactions between bacteria contribute to the development of bacterial
      communities.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of air-dispersed microorganisms in dental settings.
PG  - 32-6
AB  - To determine the number and the susceptibility of microorganisms collected in a
      clinical environment against the antimicrobial agents used commonly in dentistry,
      petri dishes containing trypticase soy agar were exposed to air in different
      sites of a multi-chair dental clinic before, during, and after multiple clinical 
      procedures and incubated for 24 hours under aerobic conditions. Colonies were
      identified by Gram stain technique and biochemical tests. Commercial paper disks 
      containing widely prescribed antimicrobial agents (beta-lactams, macrolides, and 
      clindamycin) were used to perform the antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The
      groups (colony forming units = cfu/m2/min) were submitted to the Kruskal-Wallis
      test (alpha = 5.0%), considering different clinical situations and environmental 
      sites. During clinical procedures, the number of microorganisms increased (p <
      0.05). This study highlights the need for established strategies to prevent
      resistant bacterial strains from emerging in dental settings.

AB  - AIMS: To determine whether essential oil (EO) vapours could reduce surface and
      airborne levels of bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of geranium and
      lemongrass EO individually and blended were evaluated over a range of
      concentrations by direct contact and vapour diffusion. The EO were tested in
      vitro against a selection of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria,
      including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), Acinetobacter baumanii
      and Clostridium difficile. An EO blend containing lemongrass and geranium was
      used to formulate BioScent that was dispersed into the environment using the ST
      Pro machine. The effects were variable depending on the methods used. In a sealed
      box environment, MRSA growth on seeded plates was reduced by 38% after 20 h
      exposure to BioScent vapour. In an office environment, the ST Pro machine
      dispersing BioScent effected an 89% reduction of airborne bacteria in 15 h, when 
      operated at a constant output of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: EO vapours inhibited growth
      of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria in vitro and reduced surface and 
      airborne levels of bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results
      suggest that EO vapours, particularly Bioscent, could be used as a method of air 
      disinfection.

AB  - Isolation of patients at risk of invasive mould infection might be suitable for
      the reduction of invasive aspergillosis or zygomycosis, if combined with
      high-efficiency particulate air filtration. Prophylactic wearing of filtering
      masks of N95 or FFP2 standards has not yet been demonstrated to be efficacious in
      reducing invasive mould infections outside of scenarios with excessive
      contamination of room air by fungal spore-loaded dust. The oral broad-spectrum
      antifungal azoles posaconazole and voriconazole offer protection against invasive
      Aspergillus infections in severely neutropenic leukaemia patients and allogeneic 
      haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients; however, their routine use might 
      result not only in considerable side effects, but also in the spread of
      multi-azole-resistant Aspergillus species, so that careful selection of suitable 
      high-risk patient populations is mandatory.

TI  - Characteristics of antibiotic resistance of airborne Staphylococcus isolated from
      metro stations.
PG  - 2412-26
LID - 10.3390/ijerph10062412 [doi]
AB  - This study focused on the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a metro
      system as an example of a public transportation system. The molecular
      characteristics of Staphylococcus were investigated to discern which strains were
      isolated from metro stations in Shanghai. These were compared with strains
      isolated from hospital treatment rooms and parks. Airborne Staphylococcus samples
      in the metro were resistant to an average of 2.64 antibiotic types, and 58.0% of 
      the strain samples were resistant to at least three antibiotics; this was a
      significantly higher rate than strains from the park, but was lower than those
      from hospitals. The presence of two antibiotic resistance genes of Staphylococcus
      strains, mecA (28.0%) and qac (40.0%), were also found at significantly higher
      levels in metro samples than park samples, but did not differ significantly from 
      hospital samples. Furthermore, 22.0% of the metro Staphylococcus samples were
      found to be biofilm-positive. The high rate of antibiotic resistance found in
      Staphylococcus samples collected from metro stations, and the discovery of
      antibiotic-resistant genes, indicate that the closed indoor environment and
      crowded passengers may accelerate the spread of antibiotic resistant strains.
      More attention should be paid to the inspection and control of antibiotic
      resistant strains in public transportation systems.

AB  - We have reviewed all 3577 nosocomial infections occurring at our institution over
      a 49-month period and found coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) associated
      with 297. Seventy-eight of 193 CNS tested for antibiotic sensitivity were
      multiple-drug resistant (MR-CNS). There were 19 well-documented serious
      postoperative CNS infections including nine ventricular, seven bloodstream and
      three peritoneal infections. Each was associated with an indwelling device and 11
      of the infections involved MR-CNS. Antibiotic therapy with or without removal of 
      the device resulted in cure of all patients. Air samples taken during various
      surgical procedures frequently were positive for CNS but rarely revealed MR-CNS. 
      Our results cause concern regarding current antibiotic prophylaxis regimens.

TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Staphylococcus species isolated from
      telephone receivers.
PG  - 208-11
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms are transferred to everyday objects from the
      environment and infected individuals. Pathogenic microbes are transmissible from 
      the air, skin, hands and other interpersonal contacts and cause diseases most of 
      the time. This study centres on the microbial assessment of telephone receivers, 
      their ability to transfer bacterial infections and the isolation of these
      microorganisms from receivers, with an emphasis on Staphylococcus aureus and its 
      antibiotic susceptibility pattern. METHODS: 1,591 isolates were obtained from
      roadside telephone booths in 16 different locations in the Lagos metropolis. They
      were all characterised using the Cowan and Steel's manual, after which the
      antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the most frequently-occurring isolate was
      determined. RESULTS: Of all the locations, Oshodi was found to have the largest
      number of microorganisms, with Akoka having the least. The organisms were
      Providencia, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Proteus, Escherichia,
      Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Micrococcus and yeast. Staphylococcus
      spp. was the most frequently occurring, making up 20.2 percent of the total
      number of isolated organisms, followed by Bacillus (18 percent), while
      Enterobacter and Citrobacter were the least common. 44 percent of the total
      Staphylococcus screened for an antimicrobial susceptibility pattern showed high
      resistance to most of the antibiotics used. CONCLUSION: This result could be
      related to the emergence of Staphylococcus-resistant strains, especially in a
      highly-populated area where there are health and hygiene problems and where drugs
      are abused. Precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of infectious
      diseases through the use of public telephones.

TI  - [Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale infections in poultry: a review].
PG  - 113-6
AB  - O. rhinotracheale is a relatively new bacterium. It is found in commercial fowl
      and wild birds throughout the world. O. rhinotracheale causes respiratory
      disease, presenting as pneumonia and air sacculitis. It is transmitted
      horizontally as well as vertically. O. rhinotracheale is difficult to isolate.
      Serologically, twelve serotypes can be distinguished, of which serotype A is the 
      most prevalent. Treatment can be difficult, because acquired resistance against
      the regular antibiotics is common in O. rhinotracheale isolates. An inactivated
      vaccine for broiler breeders has been developed and for turkeys an inactivated
      autovaccine can be made.

AB  - Knowledge of the epidemiology of invasive fungal diseases in health care settings
      helps to establish the action levels necessary for its prevention. A first step
      is to identify groups of patients at high risk of invasive fungal diseases,
      establish accurate risk factors, observing the periods of greatest risk, and
      analyze the epidemiological profile in genera and species, as well as the
      patterns of antifungal resistance. Secondly, mechanisms to avoid persistent
      exposure to potential fungal pathogens must be established, protecting areas and 
      recommending measures, such as the control of the quality of the air and water
      inside and outside the hospital, and determining and promoting appropriate
      architectural designs of health institutions. Finally, apart from the correct
      implementation of these measures, the use of antifungal prophylaxis should be
      considered in selected patients at very high risk, following the guidelines
      published.

TI  - Phenotypic and molecular epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated
      in Rabta Hospital, Tunisia.
PG  - 11-9
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is often implicated in hospital outbreaks 
      in Tunisia. It's a significant opportunistic pathogen that is usually associated 
      with serious underlying diseases such as pneumoniae, meningitis and urinary tract
      infections. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the global state of
      its endemicity and the antibiotic resistance evolution. The possibility of
      nosocomial transmission of one or more epidemic strain(s) was investigated by
      means of 3 methods: biotyping, antibiotyping and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA
      analysis (RAPD). MIC for imipenem by Ellipsometer-test strip (E-TEST). The
      presence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) was detected according to the double
      synergy test of EDTA and imipenem disks. A. baumannii strains were mainly
      localized in intensive care (52.2%) and surgery units (23.6%). Among 224 strains 
      that were studied, 4 biotypes were delineated with a predominance of biotype1.
      Resistance to beta-lactams was mostly associated with the production of
      cephalosporinases and penicilinases (84.3%). 45% of strains were resistant to
      imipenem which were associated with MBL production. RAPD gave 5 genomic groups.
      This study demonstrates the epidemic behaviour airborne spread of A. baumannii in
      hospital wards. The multiresistance was often responsible for failure of
      antibiotics therapy. The prevention of nosocomial infection and severe hygiene
      controls must be performed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the germicidal properties of ultraviolet (UV) light have
      long been known, it is only comparatively recently that the antimicrobial
      properties of visible violet-blue 405 nm light have been discovered and used for 
      environmental disinfection and infection control applications. AIM: To review the
      antimicrobial properties of 405 nm light and to describe its application as an
      environmental decontamination technology with particular reference to
      disinfection of the hospital environment. METHODS: Extensive literature searches 
      for relevant scientific papers and reports. FINDINGS: A large body of scientific 
      evidence is now available that provides underpinning knowledge of the 405 nm
      light-induced photodynamic inactivation process involved in the destruction of a 
      wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial species, including resistant
      forms such as bacterial and fungal spores. For practical application, a
      high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental disinfection system
      (HINS-light EDS) has been developed and tested in hospital isolation rooms. The
      trial results have demonstrated that this 405 nm light system can provide
      continuous disinfection of air and exposed surfaces in occupied areas of the
      hospital, thereby substantially enhancing standard cleaning and infection control
      procedures. CONCLUSION: Violet-blue light, particularly 405 nm light, has
      significant antimicrobial properties against a wide range of bacterial and fungal
      pathogens and, although germicidal efficacy is lower than UV light, this
      limitation is offset by its facility for safe, continuous use in occupied
      environments. Promising results on disinfection efficacy have been obtained in
      hospital trials but the full impact of this technology on reduction of
      healthcare-associated infection has yet to be determined.

AB  - Many plants release airborne volatile compounds in response to wounding due to
      pathogenic assault. These compounds serve as plant defenses and are involved in
      plant signaling. Here, we study the effects of pectin methylesterase
      (PME)-generated methanol release from wounded plants ("emitters") on the
      defensive reactions of neighboring "receiver" plants. Plant leaf wounding
      resulted in the synthesis of PME and a spike in methanol released into the air.
      Gaseous methanol or vapors from wounded PME-transgenic plants induced resistance 
      to the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in the leaves of non-wounded
      neighboring "receiver" plants. In experiments with different volatile organic
      compounds, gaseous methanol was the only airborne factor that could induce
      antibacterial resistance in neighboring plants. In an effort to understand the
      mechanisms by which methanol stimulates the antibacterial resistance of
      "receiver" plants, we constructed forward and reverse suppression subtractive
      hybridization cDNA libraries from Nicotiana benthamiana plants exposed to
      methanol. We identified multiple methanol-inducible genes (MIGs), most of which
      are involved in defense or cell-to-cell trafficking. We then isolated the most
      affected genes for further analysis: beta-1,3-glucanase (BG), a previously
      unidentified gene (MIG-21), and non-cell-autonomous pathway protein (NCAPP).
      Experiments with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and a vector encoding two tandem
      copies of green fluorescent protein as a tracer of cell-to-cell movement showed
      the increased gating capacity of plasmodesmata in the presence of BG, MIG-21, and
      NCAPP. The increased gating capacity is accompanied by enhanced TMV reproduction 
      in the "receivers". Overall, our data indicate that methanol emitted by a wounded
      plant acts as a signal that enhances antibacterial resistance and facilitates
      viral spread in neighboring plants.

TI  - Nebulised liposomal amphotericin B for Aspergillus lung diseases: case series and
      literature review.
PG  - 173-80
LID - 10.1111/myc.12294 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 10 years the incidence of Aspergillus spp. has significantly
      increased, and it is now the most widespread air transmission fungal pathogen in 
      developed countries. Whatever the clinical expression of the pulmonary disease
      and despite recent progress in antifungal drug therapy, morbidity and mortality
      related to aspergillosis lung disease still constitute a serious threat for
      immunosuppressed or mildly immunocompromised patients. Moreover, the treatments
      currently used have many limitations due to adverse effects and drug
      interactions. Finally, subjects exposed to azoles present an increased risk of
      Aspergillus-resistant strain emergence. We have reported five cases with
      aspergillosis lung diseases that were either difficult to control or in which
      patients had a contra-indication to triazole therapy, but which showed durable
      improvement following the administration of nebulised liposomal amphotericin B.
      Our alternative strategy could be of interest for patients with aspergillosis
      lung disease who otherwise cannot be conventionally treated by triazoles.

TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin against methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients of a pediatrics ward].
PG  - 794-800
AB  - Aiming at measuring the antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against the
      strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), isolated from
      pediatrics patients in 1992, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8
      antibiotics including ABK was determined and the coagulase types of those strains
      were also examined. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Among
      coagulase types of a total of 78 strains, Type II, Type IV and Type VII were
      84.6%, 12.8% and 2.6%, respectively. No clear difference in coagulase types were 
      observed among their origins of isolation. 2. MIC90 of ABK against 42 strains
      isolated from the air passage of suspected pneumoniae patients and 36 strains
      isolated from the blood of suspected septicemia patients were 1.56 micrograms/ml 
      and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, and MIC90 of ABK against the 78 strains was
      1.56 micrograms/ml, which was equal to that of vancomycin (VCM). 3. Most of these
      strains exhibited resistance against multiple antibiotic agents including
      cefmetazole (CMZ), imipenem (IPM), fosfomycin (FOM) and minocycline. Strains
      isolated from the blood were mostly resistant to multiple agents, and most of
      them were especially highly resistant to CMZ and IPM. ABK, however, showed potent
      antimicrobial activities even to those strains. These results were similar to the
      results obtained several years ago. 4. Considering the fact that ABK demonstrates
      not only potent antimicrobial activities against MRSAs isolated from the
      pediatric patients, but also shows remarkable clinical effects with concomitant
      use with beta-lactams or FOM, the prospect of ABK use in MRSA infectious diseases
      of children is excellent.

PG  - 235-8
LID - 10.2500/ajr.2008.22.3178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) that is refractory to medical or
      surgical intervention may involve a particularly resistant form of infection
      known as a bacterial biofilm. Bacterial biofilms are three-dimensional aggregates
      of bacteria that often are recalcitrant to antibiotics secondary to physical
      barrier characteristics. To date, all studies investigating biofilms in CRS have 
      been descriptive in either human or animal tissue. To better understand the
      interactions of bacterial biofilms with respiratory epithelium, we describe an in
      vitro model of biofilm sinusitis by establishing mature biofilms on airway
      epithelial air-liquid interface cultures. METHODS: Airway epithelial cell
      cultures were grown on collagen-coated semipermeable support membranes as an
      air-liquid interface on tissue culture inserts. Confluent air-liquid interface
      cultures were inoculated with the biofilm-forming PAO-1 strain of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and compared with cultures inoculated with two mutant strains (sad-31 
      and sad-36) unable to form biofilms. Inoculated tissue transwells were incubated 
      for 20 hours, allowing for biofilm growth. The semipermeable membranes were then 
      harvested and imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning
      electron microscopy. RESULTS: Microscopic analysis revealed the formation of
      biofilm-forming towers in the PAO-1 inoculated wells. The bacterial biofilms were
      supported by a viable airway epithelial cell surface monolayer. CONCLUSION: This 
      study shows a reliable method for analysis of in vitro interactions of bacterial 
      biofilms and airway epithelium. The experimental manipulation of this air-liquid 
      interface model will help explore novel treatment approaches for bacterial
      biofilm-associated CRS.

TI  - [Melioidosis].
PG  - 469-75
AB  - Melioidosis is an emerging zoonosis, due to Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is a
      highly invasive, resistant, and resilient soil bacteria, transmitted by cutaneous
      or airborne route, and is a potential weapon for bioterrorism. Although the agent
      has been identified all over the world, the human disease is endemic only in SE
      Asia and Northern Australia, and gained recent interest after the December 2004
      tsunami. Human infection can be a very severe systemic disease (mortality 20 to
      80%), with protean expression, but the lung is the most affected organ (50%).
      Pathophysiology remains unclear. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor, and is
      present in half the Asian patients with melioidosis. Recommended antibiotic
      regimens are expensive, and in severe disease should be prolonged to 20 weeks to 
      reduce the risk of relapse. Prospects for prevention are limited, and no vaccine 
      is available yet.

AB  - Subject of the study was frequency of transfer of bacterial plasmids determining 
      the antibiotic resistance (R-plasmid) in argon-containing gas mixtures.
      Investigated were reference strains of Escherichia coli K-12. Conjugation took
      place during incubation in pAr/pN2/pO2, ata (1 ata = 10(5) kPa): No. 1 -
      0.0/0.8/0.2 (air control); No. 2 - 1.0/0.8/0/2; No. 3 - 0.0/1.8/0.2; No. 4 -
      1.0/1.8/0.2. E.coli conjugation was found inhibited after 24 hrs. of incubation
      with pAr elevated to 1 ata, whereas elevated partial pressure of argon (1 ata)
      and nitrogen (1.8 ata) brought transfer frequency down to the minimum.

TI  - Salicylic acid-based poly(anhydride esters) for control of biofilm formation in
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

AB  - AIMS: Bacterial biofilms generally are more resistant to stresses as compared
      with free planktonic cells. Therefore, the discovery of antimicrobial stress
      factors that have strong inhibitory effects on bacterial biofilm formation would 
      have great impact on the food, personal care, and medical industries. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Salicylate-based poly(anhydride esters) (PAE) have previously been shown
      to inhibit biofilm formation, possibly by affecting surface attachment. Our
      research evaluated the effect of salicylate-based PAE on biofilm-forming
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. To remove factors associated with
      surface physical and chemical parameters, we utilized a strain that forms
      biofilms at the air-liquid interface. Surface properties can influence biofilm
      characteristics, so the lack of attachment to a solid surface eliminates those
      constraints. The results indicate that the salicylic acid-based polymers do
      interfere with biofilm formation, as a clear difference was seen between
      bacterial strains that form biofilms at the air-liquid interface (top-forming)
      and those that form at the surface-liquid interface (bottom-forming). CONCLUSION:
      These results lead to the conclusion that the polymers may not interfere with
      attachment; rather, the polymers likely affect another mechanism essential for
      biofilm formation in Salmonella. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Biofilm
      formation can be prevented through controlled release of nature-derived
      antimicrobials formulated into polymer systems.

TI  - Evaluation of Vancoplus versus ceftriaxone against cephalosporin resistance MRSA 
      strain in experimental meningitis model.
PG  - 138-42
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of ceftriaxone plus vancomycin 
      (Vancoplus) versus ceftriaxone alone against cephalosporin resistant
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain by using meningitis
      mice model. The MRSA strain ATCC 43300 was used to induce meningitis in mice. The
      mice were fed standard pelleted diet and water ad libitum. The test room was air 
      conditioned with temperature 23 +/- 2 degrees C, humidity 65+/- 5% and with
      artificial fluorescent light 10-14 hrs. of light and dark, respectively. Twenty
      four mice were divided into four group containing six rats in each group. The
      ceftriaxone group received 28.57 mg/Kg body weight/day and the vancoplus group
      received 42.8 mg/Kg body weight/day and control as well as infected group
      received normal saline. The bacterial susceptibility test in CSF was performed
      for cephalosporin resistance MRSA strain by determining the lytic zone for the
      vancoplus and ceftriaxone antibiotic. The lytic zone was more in vancoplus as
      compared to ceftriaxone. It was also found that activities of antioxidant enzymes
      such as catalase were significantly increased (p<0.001) along with decreased
      (p<0.001) in lipid peroxidation (malonaldialdehyde) level in CSF of vancoplus
      treated group as compared to infected as well as ceftriaxone resistance group and
      come back to normal level. It was concluded that vancoplus beneficial for the
      patients who suffered from cephalosporin resistant MRSA bacterial strain.

TI  - Antibiotics, bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes: aerial transport from
      cattle feed yards via particulate matter.
PG  - 337-43
LID - 10.1289/ehp.1408555 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has become a global
      health threat and is often linked with overuse and misuse of clinical and
      veterinary chemotherapeutic agents. Modern industrial-scale animal feeding
      operations rely extensively on veterinary pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics,
      to augment animal growth. Following excretion, antibiotics are transported
      through the environment via runoff, leaching, and land application of manure;
      however, airborne transport from feed yards has not been characterized.
      OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which
      antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), and ruminant-associated microbes 
      are aerially dispersed via particulate matter (PM) derived from large-scale beef 
      cattle feed yards. METHODS: PM was collected downwind and upwind of 10 beef
      cattle feed yards. After extraction from PM, five veterinary antibiotics were
      quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass
      spectrometry, ARG were quantified via targeted quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction, and microbial community diversity was analyzed via 16S rRNA
      amplification and sequencing. RESULTS: Airborne PM derived from feed yards
      facilitated dispersal of several veterinary antibiotics, as well as microbial
      communities containing ARG. Concentrations of several antibiotics in airborne PM 
      immediately downwind of feed yards ranged from 0.5 to 4.6 mug/g of PM. Microbial 
      communities of PM collected downwind of feed yards were enriched with
      ruminant-associated taxa and were distinct when compared to upwind PM
      assemblages. Furthermore, genes encoding resistance to tetracycline antibiotics
      were significantly more abundant in PM collected downwind of feed yards as
      compared to upwind. CONCLUSIONS: Wind-dispersed PM from feed yards harbors
      antibiotics, bacteria, and ARGs.

TI  - Spread of Staphylococcus aureus in hospitals: causes and prevention.
PG  - 587-95
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major nosocomial 
      pathogen in many hospitals worldwide. Even more alarming, MRSA strains that are
      vancomycin intermediate-susceptible are isolated with increasing frequency,
      making therapy for staphylococcal infections even more difficult and prevention
      more important than ever. Spread of S. aureus in hospitals and infection control 
      measures are reviewed. The major sources of S. aureus in hospitals are septic
      lesions and carriage sites of patients and personnel. Carriage often precedes
      infection. The anterior nares are the most consistent carriage site, followed by 
      the perineal area. Skin contamination and aerial dissemination vary markedly
      between carriers and are most pronounced for combined nasal and perineal
      carriers. The principal mode of transmission is via transiently contaminated
      hands of hospital personnel. Airborne transmission seems important in the
      acquisition of nasal carriage. Infection control strategies include screening and
      isolation of newly admitted patients suspected of carrying MRSA or S. aureus with
      intermediate resistance to vancomycin, implementation of an infection control
      program to prevent transmission of resistant strains between patients and
      hospital personnel, and institution of a proper antibiotic policy to minimize
      antibiotic resistance development. MRSA carriers should be treated with
      intranasal antibiotics, e.g. mupirocin, and skin disinfectants to eliminate
      carriage. Education of hospital personnel is essential. Improved knowledge about 
      the best ways to ensure favourable infection control practices is needed. Active 
      intervention against the spread of MRSA is important.

      spathulenol. The leaf and flower essential oils showed antibacterial and
      antifungal activity against five Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacterial
      strains, multi-resistant clinical isolates from patients, i.e.,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as two yeasts.
      Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum microbicidal concentrations 
      (MMCs) were between 0.25 and 4 mg/ml.

TI  - Murine resistance to inhaled Neisseria meningitidis after infection with an
      encephalomyocarditis virus.
PG  - 398-402
AB  - A reduction in pulmonary anti-bacterial activity due to a preceding viral illness
      has been suggested as the mechanism responsible for some meningococcal infections
      of the lung. We investigated this proposed pathogenesis by infecting mice with
      airborne encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) and then challenging them 1, 4, and 7
      days later with aerosols of Neisseria meningitidis. Meningococcal clearance was
      assessed by comparing the numbers of bacteria present immediately after inhaling 
      the aerosols with the numbers present 3 hr later. To insure that EMC virus
      adequately depressed murine defense mechanisms, we also determined staphylococcal
      killing rates at 4 hr by using radiophosphorus-labeled staphylococcal aerosols.
      Viral infection depressed murine pulmonary antimeningococcal activity at 1 and 4 
      days (P < 0.01) but not at 7 days. Intrapulmonary staphylococcal killing was
      impaired on day 4 (P < 0.01) but not on days 1 or 7. Pulmonary viral titers
      decreased rapidly from 10(7) to 10(3) plaque-forming units/ml of lung during the 
      experimental period. According to these data viral disease transiently depresses 
      resistance to meningococcal infection. This impairment in host resistance is
      present while the viral titer is decreasing and follows a relatively similar
      pattern to the transient decrease noted for staphylococci.

TI  - Gas chromatographic detection of anaerobic bacteria from environment.
PG  - 823-5
AB  - A rapid method of detection of anaerobic bacteria in environment using gas
      chromatograph is described. Metabolically produced volatile and non-volatile
      fatty acid by the anaerobic bacteria are detected gas-chromatographically. Using 
      this technique anaerobic bacteria are detected from soil, air, laboratory and
      operation theatre environments and drinking water samples. In the polluted
      drinking water apart from drug resistant E. coli, Clostridium difficile is
      isolated indicating faecal pollution of drinking water from cases of antibiotic
      associated pseudomembraneous colitis. The method has great significance in
      detection of anaerobic bacteria in environment especially in the management of
      war wounds.

TI  - Outbreak of JK diphtheroid infections associated with environmental
      contamination.
PG  - 668-71
AB  - The group JK diphtheroid organism is a multiply resistant opportunistic pathogen 
      which infects immunocompromised patients sporadically. We describe the first
      reported outbreak of JK diphtheroid infections, in which four cases of bacteremia
      and one Hickman catheter site infection occurred during 4 weeks on a hematology
      ward. On this ward, JK diphtheroid was recovered from 17 of 39 patients, 10 of 17
      30-ft3 (0.840-m3) air samples, surfaces in 9 of 13 patient rooms, and hands of 4 
      of 22 personnel. Previously identified risk factors for JK diphtheroid sepsis
      (male gender, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, granulocytopenia, and prolonged 
      hospital stay) were present in infected patients but did not distinguish them
      from patients who were only colonized. Emphasis on aseptic practices was
      associated with termination of the outbreak and negative hand cultures from

TI  - Independent predictors of mortality for necrotizing fasciitis: a retrospective
      analysis in a single institution.
PG  - 467-73; discussion 473

AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), a life-threatening soft tissue infection,
      requires early diagnosis, prompt and repeated surgical intervention, and
      broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study was to identify the
      independent predictors of mortality among patients with NF in Taiwan. METHODS: We
      retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who were admitted to
      Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan, with a diagnosis of NF. The definitive
      diagnosis was confirmed by the surgical findings, including (1) dishwater or
      foul-smelling discharge, (2) presence of necrotic fascia or lack of fascial
      bleeding, and (3) lack of resistance of normally adherent muscular fascia to
      blunt dissection. To identify factors associated with mortality, variables
      including personal history and comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs,
      laboratory data, and microbiological data were compared between survivors and
      nonsurvivors. RESULTS: From January 2003 to December 2009, 472 patients treated
      for NF were included in the study. The overall mortality was 12.1% (n = 57) and
      the 30-day mortality was 11.0% (n = 52). Multivariate analysis revealed eight
      independent predictors of mortality for NF including liver cirrhosis, soft tissue
      air, Aeromonas infection, age older than 60 years, band polymorphonuclear
      neutrophils >10%, activated partial thromboplastin time >60 s, bacteremia, and
      serum creatinine >2 mg/dL. CONCLUSION: We identified eight independent predictors
      of mortality that provided useful information on the severity of NF and guidance 
      for treatment. Prospective studies are required to examine the fitness and
      sufficiency of these variables as effective predictors of NF mortality.

TI  - Prevention of infection among patients with cancer.
PG  - 1333-44
AB  - Recognition of the alterations of host defense allows a rational approach to
      preventing associated infections. One of the most effective strategies for
      preventing infection in the granulocytopenic patient is the combined use of oral 
      non-absorbable antibiotics, laminar air-flow room reverse isolation with strict
      housekeeping techniques, low microbial diet, sterile water, and topical
      antiseptics and antibiotics. The prohibitive cost, however, warrants that this
      system be restricted to research settings. The suppression of aerobic
      Gram-negative bacilli and fungi and the preservation of colonization resistance
      with such combinations as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nystatin show promise
      in preventing infection in the granulocytopenic patient. Prevention of infection 
      in neutropenic patients also requires attention to simpler but very effective
      measures such as immunizations, antimicrobial prophylaxis against intracellular
      and nonbacterial pathogens in high-risk patients, limiting invasive diagnostic
      and monitoring procedures, hand-washing by all personnel between visiting
      patients, oral hygiene, low microbial diets, axillary and perianal swabbing, and 
      care with venipunctures and marrow aspirates. Finally, while the recommendations 
      for prevention of infection are likely to continue to change with resulting
      improvement in patient care [92, 93], a tabulation summarizing current practices 
      can be established based on our current knowledge (Table 1).
