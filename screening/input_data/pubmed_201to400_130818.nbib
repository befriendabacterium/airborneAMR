TI  - [Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC)].
PG  - 582-8
AB  - Escherichia coli infections are being increasingly detected among poultry flocks,
      indicating the growing importance of this pathogen to the industry. The infection
      begins as a respiratory infection of the trachea, followed by colonization of the
      air sacs and lungs, from where it invades the blood-stream, leading to infection 
      of the deeper organs (liver, heart, oviduct, and peritoneum). A number of factors
      play a crucial role in the virulence and pathogenesis of infection. The F1 and P 
      pili are particularly important in establishing the infection at the level of the
      tracheal epithelium cell. Other important factors are aerobactin, capsule, and
      serum resistance. Treatment is with antibiotics, but the growing bacterial
      resistance of avian E. coli and stricter regulations mean that attention is
      turning to prophylactic, preventative, measures, such as vaccination. Current
      vaccines provide limited homologous protection against the pathogen. Research is 
      needed to develop a good, broad-spectrum vaccine.

TI  - Triggering germination represents a novel strategy to enhance killing of
      Clostridium difficile spores.
PG  - e12285
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0012285 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that
      is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed
      countries. Control of C. difficile is challenging because the spores are
      resistant to killing by alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antimicrobial soaps,
      and most disinfectants. Although initiation of germination has been shown to
      increase susceptibility of spores of other bacterial species to radiation and
      heat, it was not known if triggering of germination could be a useful strategy to
      increase susceptibility of C. difficile spores to radiation or other stressors.
      PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrated that exposure of dormant C. difficile
      spores to a germination solution containing amino acids, minerals, and
      taurocholic acid resulted in initiation of germination in room air. Germination
      of spores in room air resulted in significantly enhanced killing by ultraviolet-C
      (UV-C) radiation and heat. On surfaces in hospital rooms, application of
      germination solution resulted in enhanced eradication of spores by UV-C
      administered by an automated room decontamination device. Initiation of
      germination under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions resulted in increased
      susceptibility to killing by ethanol, suggesting that exposure to oxygen might
      prevent spores from progressing fully to outgrowth. Stimulation of germination
      also resulted in reduced survival of spores on surfaces in room air, possibly due
      to increased susceptibility to stressors such as oxygen and desiccation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that stimulation of
      germination could represent a novel method to enhance killing of spores by UV-C, 
      and suggest the possible application of this strategy as a means to enhance
      killing by other agents.

TI  - Dissemination of antibiotic-resistant enterococci within the ward environment:
      the role of airborne bacteria and the risk posed by unrecognized carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonized or infected patients pose a significant risk to
      noncolonized patients occupying the same room. The aim of this study was to
      investigate how far Enterococcus spp can spread from isolated and nonisolated
      patients. METHODS: Conventional microbiological methods were used to recover
      enterococci from the air and from 62 high-contact sites located within the
      near-patient and wider ward environment. Samples were collected twice weekly for 
      17 weeks. The similarity between isolates was determined via pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis. RESULTS: Vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) were recovered
      from 352 of 2,046 environmental surfaces (17.2%) and from 27 of 66 air samples
      (40.9%). During study week 14, VSE was recovered from 75 of the 124 surfaces
      sampled, representing 21.3% of all VSE-positive sites. A gentamicin-resistant VS 
      Enterococcus faecium clone was recovered in high numbers from the air (>100
      cfu/m(3)) and from surfaces throughout a 4-bed bay. The same clone was recovered 
      from an adjacent isolation room as well. A total of 55 surfaces were contaminated
      with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The environment of 2 isolated
      patients accounted for 85% of contaminated sites. Neither patient was known to be
      VRE-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Unrecognized colonization and/or the aerosolization of
      enterococci together with inadequate cleaning can lead to heavy, widespread, and 
      persistent environmental contamination. All pose a significant risk for
      acquisition of antibiotic-resistant enterococci.

TI  - Nationwide survey of salmonella prevalence in environmental dust from layer farms
      in Japan.
PG  - 1993-2000
AB  - A nationwide survey was conducted to determine Salmonella prevalence in airborne 
      dust from layer farms. Of the 4,090 layer farms in Japan, 203 were surveyed and
      48 (23.6%) of these were positive for Salmonella. Salmonella isolation rates were
      higher in the eastern (24.3%), central (25.6%), western (23.9%), and southern
      (27.5%) prefectures than they were in the northern (13.3%) prefecture. We
      recovered 380 Salmonella isolates and identified 34 different Salmonella
      serovars. Salmonella Infantis was the most prevalent serovar (42 [11.1%] of 380),
      followed by Salmonella Agona (39 [10.3%] of 380), Salmonella Mbandaka (37 [9.7%] 
      of 380), Salmonella Cerro (32 [8.4%] of 380), Salmonella Thompson (29 [7.6%] of
      380), and Salmonella Braenderup (27 [7.1%] of 380). Of the 380 isolates, 273
      (71.8%) were resistant to more than one antibiotic. Salmonella Infantis (41
      [97.6%] of 42), Salmonella Agona (38 [97.4%] of 39), and Salmonella Mbandaka (34 
      [91.9%] of 37) showed the highest resistance rates. We found 18 different
      resistance patterns and the most common (179 [47.1%] of 273) was resistant to
      dihydrostreptomycin. One of the 13 Salmonella Hadar isolates was resistant to
      eight antibiotics. To investigate characteristics of Salmonella Agona, Salmonella
      Infantis, and Salmonella Mbandaka isolates across different prefectures, we
      performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis by using XbaI and BlnI. The Salmonella
      Agona and Salmonella Mbandaka dendrograms were grouped into seven clusters, with 
      80 and 70% similarity, respectively. Because the Salmonella Infantis dendrogram
      showed low similarity, there is a possibility of genetic diffusion of this
      serovar across Japan. This report is the first to describe Salmonella
      contamination in airborne dust from layer farms in Japan. Our findings should be 
      useful for future Salmonella infection monitoring and control.

TI  - Acanthamoeba-bacteria: a model to study host interaction with human pathogens.
PG  - 936-41
AB  - Acanthamoebae are free-living amoebae distributed worldwide. They are among the
      most prevalent protozoa found in the environment, and have been isolated from a
      wide variety of public water supplies, swimming pools, bottled water, ventilation
      ducts, soil, air, surgical instruments, contact lenses, dental treatment units
      and hospitals. Acanthamoebae feed on bacteria by phagocytosis, but some bacteria 
      are able to survive and sometimes multiply in the host, resulting in new
      properties of the bacteria. The intracellular growth of bacteria has been
      associated with enhanced environmental survival of the bacteria, increased
      virulence and increased resistance against antibiotic substances. The advantage
      of utilising free-living amoebae is that research can be carried out on
      non-mammalian cells as a model based on natural reality to study bacterial
      virulence and pathogenicity. Amoebae are easy to handle experimentally compared
      with mammalian cells and allow studies on host factors for host-parasite
      interactions. Bacteria are easily manipulated genetically, which creates the
      possibility of research on mutants to study bacteria-host interactions. Thus
      utilising this non-mammalian model can result in better understanding of
      interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and assist in the
      development of new therapeutic agents to recognise and treat infections.

TI  - Effects of essential oil treatment, gas atmosphere, and storage temperature on
      Listeria monocytogenes in a model vegetable system.
PG  - 1209-15
AB  - Natural antimicrobials such as plant essential oils (EOs) may be useful for
      controlling pathogenic bacteria on fresh-cut vegetables. The antilisterial
      properties of EOs (thyme, oregano, and rosemary), in combination with different
      storage atmospheres (air, 5% CO2-2% O2-93% N2, and 20% CO2-1% O2-79% N2) and
      temperatures (4 and 80C), were examined using a gas flow-through system combined 
      with a vegetable agar model. The antimicrobial effects of the EOs varied
      depending on the oil, the Listeria strain and species, the method of application,
      and the storage conditions tested. Using the disk diffusion assay, the
      antilisterial effectiveness of the oils was in the following order: thyme EO >
      oregano EO > rosemary EO. Volatiles released from the EOs resulted in very small 
      antilisterial effects, indicating that the oils needed to be in direct contact
      with cultures in order to be effective. There were strain and species effects,
      with L. innocua NCTC 11288 exhibiting the strongest resistance to EOs, and L.
      monocytogenes NCTC 7973 being the most sensitive strain. In addition, the
      effectiveness of the EOs was influenced by storage atmosphere and temperature.
      Use of EOs in combination with a gas atmosphere of 20% CO2-1% O2-79% N2 had the
      greatest antilisterial effect, suggesting that high CO2 atmospheres enhanced the 
      antilisterial properties of EOs. Lowering the storage temperature from 8 to 4OC
      improved the antilisterial activity of thyme oil. It is concluded that thyme and 
      oregano EOs display strong inhibitory effects against Listeria and that
      increasing CO2 levels and lowering storage temperatures further enhance these
      antilisterial effects.

TI  - Cerebral cyst infection with Micrococcus sedentarius. Case report.
PG  - 126-8
AB  - A 7-year-old boy with congenital hydrocephalus and a left septate cerebral cyst
      presented with a shunt infection due to Micrococcus sedentarius, resistant to all
      penicillins. The shunt infection was persistent despite several courses of
      parenteral, intraventricular, and intracyst antibiotics. Evaluation of the
      ventricular fluid revealed adequate "killing power" against the patient's
      microorganism. No extracranial focus of infection could be found. Computerized
      tomographic scanning, along with air ventriculography, identified a
      noncommunicating area of the cerebral cyst. Only when communication between this 
      location and the rest of the cyst was established were the antibiotics
      efficacious. Undercirculated areas of cerebrospinal fluid should be sought when
      shunt infections and ventriculitis persist in spite of adequate parenteral and
      local therapy in patients with brain cysts.

TI  - [The problem of the use of antibiotics in animal production and the appearance of
      antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in man].
PG  - 945-50
AB  - The application of various antibiotics (penicillin, tetracycline,
      chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol a.o.) as growth stimulators
      in feed-stuff for calves, lambs, pigs and for fattened poultry in low dosage
      (20-150 mg/kg feed), leads to the fact that already after a short time a great
      share of antibiotic-resistant strains appears in the intestinal flora, in which
      may be contained also pathogenic strains (e.g. species of Salmonella). In most
      cases a multifarious resistance is developed, conditioned by R-plasmides. Through
      the excretions of the animals a part of the resistant bacteria goes into the air 
      and may taken up by man. The resistant bacteria may be transferred to man also by
      food-stuff of animal origin (meat, milk, eggs). The great increase of the
      settlement of the intestinal canal of man with resistant strains of bacteria is
      for a large part to be traced back to the acceptance of such germs from useful
      animals. Due to this development also the therapeutic effectiveness of many
      antibiotics in medicine is much decreased. In future only such antibiotics shall 
      be used in the feeding of animals, which cannot be used therapeutically. Also
      other ergotropics are increasingly used.

TI  - Detrimental effects of secondhand smoke exposure on infants with cystic fibrosis.
PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.1002/ppul.23016 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Secondhand smoke (SHS) has deleterious respiratory, immune, and
      nutritional effects in children, but there is little data regarding the effects
      of SHS exposure in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: A retrospective
      chart review was undertaken from 2008 to 2012 of 75 infants with CF. Growth, lung
      function, Chest CT imaging, and microbiologic characteristics were compared
      between 4 and 12 months for SHS and non-SHS exposed patients. RESULTS: SHS
      exposed infants with CF had decreased growth between 4 and 12 months compared to 
      non-SHS exposed infants. SHS exposure was associated with increased
      bronchodilator responsiveness and air trapping, but no other lung function or
      radiologic differences. SHS exposure was also associated with increased
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and anaerobic growth on
      respiratory culture. There was no difference in Pseudomonas aeruginosa between
      groups. There were no differences in antibiotic use or hospitalizations between
      the groups. CONCLUSIONS: SHS exposure in CF infants is associated with diminished
      growth, increased air trapping and bronchodilator responsiveness, and propensity 
      to culture MRSA and facultative anaerobic bacteria, suggesting the need for
      early, aggressive parental smoking cessation interventions to prevent SHS
      exposure complications.

TI  - Wound infections acquired from a disperser of an unusual strain of Staphylococcus
      aureus.
PG  - 195-8
AB  - Seven post-operative wounds were infected with a strain of Staphylococcus aureus,
      probably acquired from a theatre orderly who suffered from a dry generalized
      eczema. The orderly was a nasal and heavy skin carrier, and was shown to be a
      disperser of the epidemic strain. Infection was probably acquired from airborne
      contamination in the operating theatre, since the orderly did not scrub-up. The
      epidemic strain (phage type 80/81 at 1,000 routine test dilution) was sensitive
      to penicillin and resistant to tetracycline and novobiocin. Neomycin resistance
      was variable. This strain was found to lose resistance to neomycin when
      subcultured in the absence of the antibiotic.

TI  - Invasive infection due to Trichosporon cutaneum in patients with hematologic
      malignancies.
PG  - 484-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Invasive infection due to Trichosporon is a rare but often fatal
      disease in immunocompromised patients. In this study, data on patients with
      hematologic malignancies who had an invasive infection due to Trichosporon
      diagnosed at the Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, were
      analyzed. METHODS: Positive blood cultures obtained between 1986 and 1996 were
      reviewed. Medical records of all patients who were positive for Trichosporon in
      their blood culture or autopsy material were then examined. RESULTS: A total of
      nine patients with hematologic malignancies were reported positive for
      Trichosporon cutaneum in their blood culture or at the time of autopsy. The
      average age was 52 years, and all patients except 2 had acute leukemia. All 8
      patients with positive blood cultures were neutropenic, and the average duration 
      of neutropenia before the positive blood cultures were obtained was 43 (range,
      0-101) days. For prophylaxis of fungal infection, eight patients were kept in a
      laminar air flow room and also received nebulization with amphotericin B. Five
      patients received oral amphotericin B. All 9 patients died of the infection an
      average of 9 days after their blood cultures turned positive. Minimal inhibitory 
      concentrations were evaluated in six available strains obtained from the
      patients. They were all resistant to amphotericin B and azoles. CONCLUSIONS: More
      effective antifungal agents are required for the treatment of infections with
      this organism.

TI  - Progress toward development of vaccines against melioidosis: A review.
PG  - 1437-45
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2010.07.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melioidosis is a serious and often fatal disease that is prevalent in
      subtropical and tropical climates, primarily in at-risk groups (eg, those with
      diabetes, alcoholism, or other cause of immunosuppression). Treatment is often
      unsuccessful, with infection frequently relapsing. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the
      etiologic agent of melioidosis, is inherently resistant to many antibiotics.
      OBJECTIVE: This article reviews available evidence on the development of vaccines
      against melioidosis, including live attenuated vaccines, inactivated whole cell
      vaccines, and recombinant subunit vaccines. METHODS: Web of Science and PubMed
      (1950-February 2010) were searched for relevant reports using the term
      Burkholderia pseudomallei alone and combined with live attenuated vaccine,
      inactivated vaccine, animal models, and immunity. The reference lists of
      identified articles were reviewed for additional relevant publications. RESULTS: 
      Studies in murine models suggest that protective immunity against B pseudomallei 
      may be induced by a range of living and nonliving immunogens. The strongest
      protective immunity was induced by live attenuated immunogens, although concerns 
      about latency make it unlikely that such vaccines will be appropriate for use in 
      humans. Heat-inactivated immunogens have shown promise, and several candidates
      for subunit vaccines have been tested. However, in all cases, it has been
      difficult to achieve induction of sterile immunity and protection against
      airborne infection. CONCLUSIONS: Live attenuated mutants of B pseudomallei have
      been found to be the most effective immunogens in mice, although it is unlikely
      that such mutants would be appropriate for a vaccine against melioidosis in
      humans. The ongoing challenge is to identify nonliving formulations that are able
      to induce good protective immunity. Both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are
      likely to be required. In this respect, naked DNA vaccines have the potential to 
      provide high-level protection.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of murine lung cells against Staphylococcus aureus is
      increased in vitro and in vivo after elafin gene transfer.
PG  - 3609-17
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen often found in pneumonia and sepsis. In the
      context of the resistance of this organism to conventional antibiotics, an
      understanding of the regulation of natural endogenous antimicrobial molecules is 
      of paramount importance. Previous studies have shown that both human and mouse
      airways express a variety of these molecules, including defensins, cathelicidins,
      and the four-disulfide core protein secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. We
      demonstrate here by culturing mouse tracheal epithelial cells at an air-liquid
      interface that, despite the production of Defb1, Defb14, and Defr1 in this
      system, these cells are unable to clear S. aureus when exposed to this
      respiratory pathogen. Using an adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene transfer strategy,
      we show that overexpression of elafin, an anti-elastase/antimicrobial molecule
      (also a member of the four-disulfide core protein family), dramatically improves 
      the clearance of S. aureus. In addition, we also demonstrate that this
      overexpression is efficient in vivo and that intratracheal instillation of
      Ad-elafin significantly reduced the lung bacterial load and demonstrates
      concomitant anti-inflammatory activity by reducing neutrophil numbers and markers
      of lung inflammation, such as bronchoalveolar lavage levels of tumor necrosis
      factor and myeloperoxidase. These findings show that an increased antimicrobial
      activity phenotype is provided by the elafin molecule and have implications for
      its use in S. aureus-associated local and systemic infections.

TI  - Housefly population density correlates with shigellosis among children in
      Mirzapur, Bangladesh: a time series analysis.
PG  - e2280
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002280 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shigella infections are a public health problem in developing and
      transitional countries because of high transmissibility, severity of clinical
      disease, widespread antibiotic resistance and lack of a licensed vaccine. Whereas
      Shigellae are known to be transmitted primarily by direct fecal-oral contact and 
      less commonly by contaminated food and water, the role of the housefly Musca
      domestica as a mechanical vector of transmission is less appreciated. We sought
      to assess the contribution of houseflies to Shigella-associated
      moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children less than five years old in
      Mirzapur, Bangladesh, a site where shigellosis is hyperendemic, and to model the 
      potential impact of a housefly control intervention. METHODS: Stool samples from 
      843 children presenting to Kumudini Hospital during 2009-2010 with new episodes
      of MSD (diarrhea accompanied by dehydration, dysentery or hospitalization) were
      analyzed. Housefly density was measured twice weekly in six randomly selected
      sentinel households. Poisson time series regression was performed and
      autoregression-adjusted attributable fractions (AFs) were calculated using the
      Bruzzi method, with standard errors via jackknife procedure. FINDINGS: Dramatic
      springtime peaks in housefly density in 2009 and 2010 were followed one to two
      months later by peaks of Shigella-associated MSD among toddlers and pre-school
      children. Poisson time series regression showed that housefly density was
      associated with Shigella cases at three lags (six weeks) (Incidence Rate Ratio = 
      1.39 [95% CI: 1.23 to 1.58] for each log increase in fly count), an association
      that was not confounded by ambient air temperature. Autocorrelation-adjusted AF
      calculations showed that a housefly control intervention could have prevented
      approximately 37% of the Shigella cases over the study period. INTERPRETATION:
      Houseflies may play an important role in the seasonal transmission of Shigella in
      some developing country ecologies. Interventions to control houseflies should be 
      evaluated as possible additions to the public health arsenal to diminish Shigella
      (and perhaps other causes of) diarrheal infection.

AB  - The most important factors of infection in leukemic patients and immunodepressive
      effect of chemotherapy are evaluated. The microorganisms causing infections most 
      frequently are considered. The associations of antibiotics for therapy of severe 
      infections are reported. The employement of granulocyte transfusion, in patients 
      with severe neutropenia and infections antibiotico-resistents, is also
      considered. Dealing with patients liable of infections the possibility of
      infection prevention and therapy in protected environment is faced. 12 patients
      affected by acute nonlymphocitic leukemia were treated with cytostatic drugs to
      induce remission in laminar air flow room. The number of infections is
      significantly decreased in comparison with of patients treated in open ward. In
      protected environment it is possible to treat patients with the maximal dose of
      antiblastic drugs without interruption obtaining higher number of complete
      remission.

TI  - In vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous
      catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
PG  - 1628-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with minocycline
      and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases
      the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Questions have been
      raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the
      emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to
      determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments
      impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of
      antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the
      surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such
      that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation
      at 35 degrees C in air. Test organisms included American Type Culture Collection 
      strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus
      faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of
      colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days 
      (two catheter segments per test). Colonies on agar surfaces located at varying
      distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin
      resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per
      test). In addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline
      and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin
      resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). RESULTS: Inhibitory zones of 14 to
      47 mm were observed with S aureus, S epidermidis, E faecalis, and E coli. Growth 
      of P aeruginosa was not inhibited by CVC segments. Testing of colonies of the
      first four organisms at various distances from CVC segments after varying periods
      of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, S
      aureus vs rifampin). Recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline
      and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between CVC exposure and the
      emergence of resistance was not established. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data
      suggest that the exposure of Gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or
      minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. However, exposure of
      bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to
      resistance. Clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk
      and implications of the development of resistance.

TI  - Microbial contents of vacuum cleaner bag dust and emitted bioaerosols and their
      implications for human exposure indoors.
PG  - 6331-6
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01583-13 [doi]
AB  - Vacuum cleaners can release large concentrations of particles, both in their
      exhaust air and from resuspension of settled dust. However, the size,
      variability, and microbial diversity of these emissions are unknown, despite
      evidence to suggest they may contribute to allergic responses and infection
      transmission indoors. This study aimed to evaluate bioaerosol emission from
      various vacuum cleaners. We sampled the air in an experimental flow tunnel where 
      vacuum cleaners were run, and their airborne emissions were sampled with
      closed-face cassettes. Dust samples were also collected from the dust bag. Total 
      bacteria, total archaea, Penicillium/Aspergillus, and total Clostridium cluster 1
      were quantified with specific quantitative PCR protocols, and emission rates were
      calculated. Clostridium botulinum and antibiotic resistance genes were detected
      in each sample using endpoint PCR. Bacterial diversity was also analyzed using
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), image analysis, and band
      sequencing. We demonstrated that emission of bacteria and molds
      (Penicillium/Aspergillus) can reach values as high as 1E5 cell equivalents/min
      and that those emissions are not related to each other. The bag dust bacterial
      and mold content was also consistent across the vacuums we assessed, reaching up 
      to 1E7 bacterial or mold cell equivalents/g. Antibiotic resistance genes were
      detected in several samples. No archaea or C. botulinum was detected in any air
      samples. Diversity analyses showed that most bacteria are from human sources, in 
      keeping with other recent results. These results highlight the potential
      capability of vacuum cleaners to disseminate appreciable quantities of molds and 
      human-associated bacteria indoors and their role as a source of exposure to
      bioaerosols.

TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for Helicobacter pylori: sensitivity test
      results and their clinical relevance.
PG  - 1545-55
AB  - There are multiple test methodologies to determine the antibiogram of an
      organism. Standardized susceptibility test methods are based upon rapidly
      growing, aerobic microorganisms in which overnight incubation results in
      definitive endpoints. In vitro susceptibility testing for fastidious organisms
      that require complex media for growth, require incubation in atmospheres other
      than ambient air, or are slow-growing (anaerobes, mycobacteria, filamentous
      fungi) are problematic and in general are not standardized. H. pylori falls into 
      this category of troublesome organisms. For the microaerobic organism H. pylori, 
      testing is challenging because the organism grows slowly even under optimal
      culture conditions. Recently the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
      Standards (NCCLS) approved the agar dilution method as the test of choice for
      testing H. pylori. While not entirely reliable in predicting the outcome of
      treatment for metronidazole resistant organisms, the resistance determined for
      clarithromycin by this method generally predicts treatment failure. Quality
      control breakpoints for H. pylori ATCC 43504 were established and breakpoints for
      clarithromycin were approved by the NCCLS in 1999. Breakpoints are minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a drug at which an organism is deemed either
      susceptible or resistant to the antibiotic using standard dosing regimens
      containing that drug. Significant progress has been made with respect to
      development of tests to detect antimicrobial resistance, but there still remains 
      no consensus as to the breakpoints for agents used in the treatment of H. pylori 
      infection other than clarithromycin. This article will address the controversies 
      associated with the reporting of antibiotic resistance data and the
      interpretation of these data.

AB  - Fluid-containing emphysematous bullae are an under-reported complication of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The roles of bronchoscopy in the work-up
      and of antibiotics in the treatment are undefined. This study reports the
      combined results from the analysis of 16 cases treated at the present authors'
      institution and 36 previously reported cases. The median age at presentation was 
      58 yrs and the median duration of follow-up was 60 weeks. A third of the patients
      were asymptomatic, while two-thirds presented with symptoms, including 10% who
      had evidence of a severe lung infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were cultured from
      the bullae fluid in three symptomatic patients. Sputum and blood cultures were
      uninformative. Bronchoscopy, performed in two-thirds of the cases, added no
      diagnostic information. Antibiotic treatment did not result in a more rapid
      resolution of the air fluid level. Percutaneous drainage was safe and effective
      in four patients. In conclusion, patients with fluid-containing bullae present
      with a spectrum of illness. Antibiotic treatment does not hasten radiographic
      resolution and bronchoscopy has no diagnostic or therapeutic role.

TI  - Infection due to Corynebacterium species in marrow transplant patients.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - A Corynebacterium species consistently resistant to all antibiotic therapy except
      vancomycin caused bacteremia in 32 of 284 (11%) marrow transplant patients.
      Twenty-one patients had colonization or infection before bacteremia. Twenty-six
      of the 32 patients were males, and males older than 16 years were infected
      significantly more often than females over 16, or than all patient under 16. A
      case-control study showed that infected patients had greater exposure to
      antibiotics; more often had failure of engraftment and persistent
      granulocytopenia; were in laminar air-flow rooms less often; and had greater
      inhospital mortality. Cultural surveillance showed that 17 of 42 marrow
      transplant patients were colonized with Corynebacterium species. Likelihood of
      colonization appeared related to age, sex, and duration of hospitalization.
      Prevalence of colonization in other populations was 1% in nonhospitalized healthy
      adults and 13% in adults in a general hospital. Corynebacterium species
      infections occur primarily in adult males with granulocytopenia, mucocutaneous
      defects, and receiving intensive antibiotic therapy.

      J. Bacteriol. 84:370-374. 1962.-A comparison of the extracellular products of
      glucose metabolism during aerobic exponential growth of Escherichia coli showed
      that a streptomycin-dependent strain produced large amounts of l-valine while
      only trace amounts of this amino acid were produced by streptomycin-sensitive
      strains. A further difference between sensitive and dependent mutants was the
      production by the latter of lactic acid when the gas phase was changed from air
      to nitrogen. Resistant cultures grown in antibiotic-free medium were similar to
      sensitive cultures, but when dihydrostreptomycin was added, the resistant
      organism produced lactic and pyruvic acids. Three strains of
      streptomycin-sensitive E. coli accumulated pyruvic acid from glucose oxidation in
      the presence of concentrations of dihydrostreptomycin which inhibited
      multiplication. Further evidence is thus provided to implicate reactions of
      pyruvate as being of significance in the mechanism of action of streptomycin.

PG  - 1809

AB  - Bacteria use chemical signals to sense each other and to regulate various
      physiological functions. Although it is known that some airborne volatile organic
      compounds function as bacterial signalling molecules, their identities and
      effects on global gene expression and bacterial physiological processes remain
      largely unknown. Here we perform microarray analyses of Escherichia coli exposed 
      to volatile organic compounds emitted from Bacillus subtilis. We find that
      2,3-butanedione and glyoxylic acid mediate global changes in gene expression
      related to motility and antibiotic resistance. Volatile organic
      compound-dependent phenotypes are conserved among bacteria and are regulated by
      the previously uncharacterized ypdB gene product through the downstream
      transcription factors soxS, rpoS or yjhU. These results strongly suggest that
      bacteria use airborne volatile organic compounds to sense other bacteria and to
      change master regulatory gene activity to adapt.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus ampicillin-resistant from the odontological clinic
      environment.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the prevalence of Staphylococcus spp.
      and S. aureus in the odontological clinic environment (air), their production of 
      beta-lactamase and antibacterial susceptibility to the major antibiotics utilized
      in medical particle. During 12 months of samples collect were isolated 9775 CFU
      by MSA medium suggesting a high amount of Staphylococcus spp. in the clinic
      environment which can appear through aerosols. A total of 3149 colonies (32.2%)
      were suggestive of pathogenic staphylococci. Gram coloration, catalase test,
      colony-mallow growing on chromogenic medium, and coagulase test confirmed the
      identity of 44 (0.45%) S. aureus isolates. Of these, 35 isolates (79.5%) showed
      production of beta-lactamase by Cefinase discs and resistance to ampicillin,
      erythromycin (7 isolates) and tetracycline (1 isolate) suggesting the existence
      of multiresistant isolates. The evaluation of the oxacillin MIC by Etest assays
      showed susceptibility patterns suggesting the inexistence of the mecA gene in
      chromosomal DNA. These results point out to the need of a larger knowledge on the
      contamination means and propagation of this microorganism into the odontological 
      clinic.

TI  - Factors affecting microbial adhesion to stainless steel and other materials used 
      in medical devices.
PG  - 1138-45
AB  - The role of biofilm in medical device associated infections is well documented.
      Biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic cells, these are
      extremely difficult to treat. Prevention strategies include efforts to insert
      implants under stringent aseptic conditions, and also encompass the development
      of novel materials which interfere with the initial attachment of microorganisms 
      to the surface of the device. Microbial cells also attach onto hygienic surfaces 
      in the hospital setting, and thereby pose a cross-infection problem. In this
      case, vigorous cleaning and sanitizing regimes may be employed in addition to any
      surface modifications. Many factors affect the initial attachment of organisms to
      inert substrata, and their subsequent retention or removal/detachment, including 
      the physical and chemical nature and location of the substratum, the type of
      organic material and microorganisms potentially fouling the surface, and the
      nature of the interface (solid-liquid in the body; solid-air on environmental
      surfaces). Focusing on one factor, surface topography, it is apparent that many
      further variables need to be defined in order to fully understand the
      interactions occurring between the cell and surface. It is therefore important
      when modifying one substratum surface property in order to reduce adhesion, to
      also consider other potentially confounding factors.

TI  - [Current strategies for prevention of prosthetic joint infection].
PG  - 229-36
AB  - Deep sepsis still remains the second most common cause of prosthetic joint
      failure despite its overall incidence is decreasing. It can be defined as a
      bacterial growth and replication on the prosthetic joint surface resulting in
      periprosthetic tissue damage and prosthesis loosening. The implants are colonized
      by airborne-, skin-, tool-, and/ or surgeon-related bacteria during surgery even 
      though majority of procedures are performed under strictly respected conditions
      nowadays. After the insertion of the prosthesis into the human body the race
      between bacteria and host cells begins on what will colonize the prosthetic
      surface first. If the bacteria are more successful then they develop on formation
      of biofilm which is the biological correlative for the prosthetic joint infection
      (PJI) resisting effectively against host immune response and antibiotics. That is
      why preventative measures are strongly worth to do it, and removal of the
      prosthesis is the single optimal treatment. Each step in the pathogenesis of
      prosthetic joint infection may represent relevant targets against which
      prevention strategies may be directed. Of them the most useful seems to be
      identification of individual factors predisposing for PJI development, antibiotic
      prophylaxis given before the surgery, and operating room/ surgical quality
      parameters. Key words: prevention, prosthetic joint infection, deep sepsis,
      biofilm, total joint replacement.

TI  - Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      from residential indoor bioaerosols.
PG  - 1859-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the levels of Staphylococcus aureus and
      antibiotic-resistant S. aureus in colony-forming units (CFU) per cubic meter of
      air. DESIGN: We used Andersen two-stage samplers to collect bioaerosol samples
      from 24 houses in El Paso, Texas, using tryptic soy agar as the collection media,
      followed by the replicate plate method on Chapman Stone selective medium to
      isolate S. aureus. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to determine
      antibiotic resistance to ampicillin, penicillin, and cefaclor, which represent
      two distinct classes of antibiotics. RESULTS: The average recovered concentration
      of respirable heterotrophic organisms found outside each home was 345.38 CFU/m3, 
      with an average of 12.63 CFU/m3 for S. aureus. The average recovered
      concentration of respirable heterotrophic organisms found inside each home was
      460.23 CFU/m3, with an average of 15.39 CFU/m3 for S. aureus. The respirable S.
      aureus recovered from inside each home had an average resistance of 54.59% to
      ampicillin and 60.46% to penicillin. Presence of cefaclor-resistant and of
      multidrug-resistant S. aureus was the same, averaging 13.20% per house. The
      respirable S. aureus recovered from outside each home had an average resistance
      of 34.42% to ampicillin and 41.81% to penicillin. Presence of cefaclor-resistant 
      and of multidrug-resistant S. aureus was the same, averaging 13.96% per house.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that antibiotic-resistant bioaerosols are
      commonly found within residential homes. Our results also suggest that resistant 
      strains of airborne culturable S. aureus are present in higher concentrations
      inside the study homes than outside the homes.

TI  - Airway hyperreactivity and peripheral airway dysfunction in influenza A
      infection.
PG  - 295-303
AB  - We studied 39 consecutive college students with documented nonpneumonitic
      influenza A/Victoria/3/75/H3N2 infection to examine alterations in pulmonary
      mechanics and airway reactivity to cholinergic challenge, and to assess the
      effect of the antiviral agent amantadine on these changes. Thirty-six of the 39
      subjects (92 per cent) demonstrated diminished forced flow rates and decreased
      density-dependent forced flow rates while breathing a helium-O2 mixture as
      compared to an air mixture. On initial evaluation, there was no significant
      difference in forced flow rates or density dependence between a group of 18
      subjects treated with amantadine and 21 subjects given a placebo. However, the
      placebo group demonstrated further decreases in density dependence 7 days after
      initial presentation, whereas the amantadine group demonstrated a significant
      increase in density dependence (P less than 0.05), which suggested an accelerated
      improvement in peripheral airway dysfunction in the treated group. After
      inhalation of carbachol aerosol, 25 subjects showed a significant (P less than
      0.05) increase in total respiratory resistance that was prolonged and independent
      of hay fever history. Airway hyperreactivity gradually diminished during a 7-week
      period in both groups. There was no significant difference in the initial degree 
      of hyperreactivity or in the rate of improvement between groups. These data
      suggest that nonpneumonitic influenza infection may be associated with both an
      inflammatory response predominantly in the peripheral airways and transient
      bronchial hyperreactivity. By means of its antiviral effect, amantadine may
      arrest the proliferation of virus and associated inflammatory response in
      peripheral airways, but airway hyperreactivity presumably related to initially
      damaged airway depithelium is not attenuated by inhibition of viral replication
      after infection has been established.

TI  - Analysis of Transmission of MRSA and ESBL-E among Pigs and Farm Personnel.
PG  - e0138173
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0138173 [doi]
AB  - Livestock-associated bacteria with resistance to two or more antibiotic drug
      classes have heightened our awareness for the consequences of antibiotic
      consumption and spread of resistant bacterial strains in the veterinary field. In
      this study we assessed the prevalence of concomitant colonization with
      livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and
      enterobacteriaceae expressing extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBL-E) in farms 
      at the German-Dutch border region. Nasal colonization of pigs with MRSA (113/547 
      (20.7%)) was less frequent than rectal colonization with ESBL-E (163/540
      (30.2%)). On the individual farm level MRSA correlated with ESBL-E recovery. The 
      data further provide information on prevalence at different stages of pig
      production, including abattoirs, as well as in air samples and humans living and 
      working on the farms. Notably, MRSA was detected in stable air samples of 34 out 
      of 35 pig farms, highlighting air as an important MRSA transmission reservoir.
      The majority of MRSA isolates, including those from humans, displayed
      tetracycline resistance and spa types t011 and t034 characteristic for LA-MRSA,
      demonstrating transmission from pigs to humans. ESBL-E positive air samples were 
      detected on 6 out of 35 farms but no pig-to-human transmission was found.
      Detection of ESBL-E, e.g. mostly Escherichia coli with CTX-M-type ESBL, was
      limited to these six farms. Molecular typing revealed transmission of ESBL-E
      within the pig compartments; however, related strains were also found on
      unrelated farms. Although our data suggest that acquisition of MRSA and ESBL-E
      might occur among pigs in the abattoirs, MRSA and ESBL-E were not detected on the
      carcasses. Altogether, our data define stable air (MRSA), pig compartments
      (ESBL-E) and abattoir waiting areas (MRSA and ESBL-E) as major hot spots for
      transmission of MRSA and/or ESBL-E along the pig production chain.

TI  - Efficacy of amikacin and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 101-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis was a leading cause of death at the turn of the 20th
      century and continues to be one of the medical scourges of mankind. Before the
      availability of antimicrobial drugs the cornerstone of treatment was rest in the 
      open air in sanatoria. The major breakthrough in treatment of tuberculosis came
      with the discovery of Streptomycin. Later, INH, Ethambutol. Pyrazinamide,
      Rifampicin were added to the arsenal. Objective of this study was to determine
      the sensitivity of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis against two
      second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin. METHODS: This
      cross-sectional study was conducted at Department of Microbiology. Armed Forces
      Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Rawalpindi. All routine clinical samples received
      for acid fast bacilli (AFB) in the Department of Microbiology. AFIP, Rawalpindi
      were processed by modified Petroff's technique and inoculated on Lowenstein
      Jensen (LJ) medium and Bactec 460 Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture system.
      After identification of M. tuberculosis sensitivity was performed against
      first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Then susceptibility of M. tuberculosis
      isolates against Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin was performed on LJ medium. H37Rv was
      used as control strain. RESULTS: Results were interpreted using resistance ratio 
      method. Out of 100 M. tuberculosis isolates, 98% were sensitive to Amikacin and
      97% to Ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin are very effective
      2nd line anti-tuberculosis drugs against tuberculosis isolates in our set-up.

TI  - Tuberculosis: medical students at risk.
PG  - 395-7
AB  - In 1979 an outbreak of tuberculosis occurred in medical students at the
      University of Sydney. Eight of 35 Mantoux-negative students who attended the
      autopsy of an immunosuppressed patient with unsuspected active tuberculosis
      became infected and one developed clinical disease. A report of the incident was 
      prepared for publication because it supported the then controversial University
      policy of recommending BCG vaccination to medical and dental students in a
      country where the reported prevalence of tuberculosis is very low. The report was
      never published, mainly in order to protect the privacy of the individual
      students involved, but also because it was felt by the administration of the time
      that it might undermine confidence in infection control procedures in the autopsy
      room. The original report, updated and reproduced here, suggested that
      tuberculosis might be an emerging nosocomial problem. This has been all too
      clearly realised since its re-emergence as an opportunistic infection in AIDS
      patients. Worldwide, the problem of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis provides an added risk of a return to the situation which prevailed 
      early this century when tuberculosis was a major occupational risk for young
      health care workers. Infection often restricted career choices, even in those
      whose disease was relatively benign. Our purpose in bringing this incident to
      light after so many years is to point out the relevance of the extensive studies 
      of the problem which were conducted in the 1930s and 1940s to the current
      situation and to suggest that health care students are vulnerable to airborne
      infections as well as those spread by inoculation injuries. In retrospect, our
      1979 conclusions about prospects for preventing nosocomial tuberculosis appear
      optimistic.

TI  - Surpassing nature: rational design of sterile-surface materials.
PG  - 343-8
AB  - The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens and recalcitrance of biofilm infections
      present a formidable challenge to combating infectious diseases. There are
      numerous disinfectants and antiseptics for treating materials in hospitals and
      community settings, and devices such as catheters impregnated with
      anti-infectives have been introduced into practice. However, there are many
      limitations of materials impregnated with a leaching antibacterial agent.
      Recently, non-leaching, permanent, sterile-surface materials have been developed 
      in which one end of a long-chained hydrophobic polycation containing
      antimicrobial monomers is attached covalently to the surface of a material, for
      example, cotton or plastic. The polymeric chain allows the antimicrobial moieties
      to permeate into, and kill, the cells of the pathogen. These sterile-surface
      materials kill both air- and waterborne pathogens and are not susceptible to
      existing resistance mechanisms.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate a dairy located in the arid southwest
      United States to determine the concentrations and seasonal variation of airborne 
      fungi and bacteria and to determine the percentage of antibiotic resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus. The authors used two-stage ambient air sampling systems to
      measure the culturable airborne fungal organisms and bacteria on a monthly basis.
      The authors recovered the most fungal, bacterial, and S. aureus organisms during 
      the spring months. The most common fungi identified were Cladosporium,
      Aspergillus, and Stemphylium, which were most common in the spring and least
      common in the summer. S. aureus made up 4.2% to 5.5% of the total bacteria, and
      greater than 50% of this bacteria were found to be resistant to ampicillin,
      penicillin, or cefaclor, with the greatest incidence of antibiotic resistance
      occuring in the fall. The incidence of S. aureus resistant to at least two
      antibiotics ranged from 14% in the spring to 54% in the fall.

TI  - [Serious bacterial infections in patients with hematologic disorders].
PG  - 462-7
AB  - In patients with hematologic disorders, especially, leukemias and lymphomas,
      complicated bacterial infection frequently becomes serious. Main predisposing
      factors are (1) the disease and its chemotherapy (2) granulocytopenia and (3)
      mucosal damage. The site of infection is often unidentified. Two special sites,
      the oral cavity and central venous catheter, should not be overlooked. The
      infection is usually treated by empiric therapy. G-CSF is effective for rapid
      granulocyte recovery. For prophylaxis, the laminar air flow room, oral
      nonabsorbable antibiotics, and systemic chemoprevention with colonization
      resistance are recommended. Noteworthy among recent infections are (1) MRSA
      infection caused by long-term use of third generation cephems and (2) neutropenic
      enterocolitis, for which the most recommended aid is surgical resection of the
      lesion.

TI  - Concentrated swine feeding operations and public health: a review of occupational
      and community health effects.
PG  - 685-99
AB  - Recent industry changes in swine-management practices have resulted in a growing 
      controversy surrounding the environmental and public health effects of modern
      swine production. The numerous wastes produced by intensive swine production not 
      only pose a significant challenge to effective environmental management but also 
      are associated with decreased air quality in confinement houses, potentially
      transferable antimicrobial resistance patterns, and several infectious agents
      that can be pathogenic to humans. Published studies have documented a variety of 
      contaminants, microbial agents, and health effects in those occupationally
      exposed to swine, and these have provided the groundwork for an increasing body
      of research to evaluate possible community health effects. Nonetheless, several
      factors limit our ability to define and quantify the potential role of intensive 
      swine-rearing facilities in occupational and community health. Our incomplete
      understanding and ability to detect specific exposures; the complicated nature of
      disease etiology; pathogenesis; and surveillance; and the inherent difficulties
      associated with study design all contribute to the inadequate level of knowledge 
      that currently prevails. However; an evaluation of the published literature; and 
      a recognition of the elements that may be compromising these studies; provides
      the foundation from which future studies may develop.

TI  - Identification of microorganisms based on headspace analysis of volatile organic 
      compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

AB  - The identification of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by
      microorganisms may assist in developing a fast and accurate methodology for the
      determination of pulmonary bacterial infections in exhaled air. As a first step, 
      pulmonary bacteria were cultured and their headspace analyzed for the total
      amount of excreted VOCs to select those compounds which are exclusively
      associated with specific microorganisms. Development of a rapid, noninvasive
      methodology for identification of bacterial species may improve diagnostics and
      antibiotic therapy, ultimately leading to controlling the antibiotic resistance
      problem. Two hundred bacterial headspace samples from four different
      microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus
      and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      to detect a wide array of VOCs. Statistical analysis of these volatiles enabled
      the characterization of specific VOC profiles indicative for each microorganism. 
      Differences in VOC abundance between the bacterial types were determined using
      ANalysis of VAriance-principal component analysis (ANOVA-PCA). These differences 
      were visualized with PCA. Cross validation was applied to validate the results.
      We identified a large number of different compounds in the various headspaces,
      thus demonstrating a highly significant difference in VOC occurrence of bacterial
      cultures compared to the medium and between the cultures themselves.
      Additionally, a separation between a methicillin-resistant and a
      methicillin-sensitive isolate of S. aureus could be made due to significant
      differences between compounds. ANOVA-PCA analysis showed that 25 VOCs were
      differently profiled across the various microorganisms, whereas a PCA score plot 
      enabled the visualization of these clear differences between the bacterial types.
      We demonstrated that identification of the studied microorganisms, including an
      antibiotic susceptible and resistant S. aureus substrain, is possible based on a 
      selected number of compounds measured in the headspace of these cultures. These
      in vitro results may translate into a breath analysis approach that has the
      potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in medical microbiology.

      wet sites as well as from air and dry surfaces. In variety "anitratus" strains
      from patients and hospital personal resistance against antibiotics and metal
      salts was more dominant than in other strains. Acinetobacter strains were more
      tolerant of dryness than E. coli but less than Micrococcus luteus. By repeated

TI  - Candida colonization in preterm babies admitted to neonatal intensive care unit
      in the rural setting.
PG  - 263-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Candida colonization in neonates results in significant morbidity and
      mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine colonization of Candida
      spp. in preterm babies and identify the risk factors. METHODS: Swabs from oral,
      rectum, groin and umblicus of 103 preterm and 100 term neonates were obtained
      within 24 hours of birth, day three, day five, day seven and thereafter every
      week till the neonate was admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
      Swabs were also collected from the mother's vagina prior to delivery. Twice every
      month, air of the NICU was sampled by settle plate and swabs were collected from 
      the hands of health care workers and inanimate objects of NICU. Identification
      and speciation was done by standard methods. Antibiotic sensitivity was studied
      against amphotericin B, ketoconazole and fluconazole by disk diffusion method.
      RESULTS: Colonization with Candida was significantly higher in preterms. Earliest
      colonization was of oral mucosa and 77.1% of the preterms had colonised at
      various sites by the first week of life. Significant risk factors in colonized
      versus non-colonized preterms were male sex, longer duration of rupture of
      membranes (DROM), administration of steroids and antibiotics and vaginal
      colonization of mothers, whereas those in preterms versus terms were low birth
      weight and gestational age. C. albicans was the commonest species, both in the
      colonized preterms (45.9%) and vagina of mothers. Resistance was seen to
      fluconazole and ketoconazole only. No Candida spp. was isolated from health care 
      personnel or environment. CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of preterms by Candida is a
      significant problem in NICU and the significant risk factors observed in
      colonized preterms were male sex, longer DROM, administration of steroids and
      antibiotics and vaginal colonization of mothers.

PG  - 423-8
AB  - Eleven hundred and sixty eight traumatic cases have been operated on under
      constant conditions in a conventional operating room with filtered air and
      positive pressure using absolute filters of 99.999 efficiency. Two hundred and
      five were submitted to post-operative prophylactic administration of
      Cephalosporin (Cefazolin) for 2 days. The overall results showed 0.6 p. 100 of
      infection but 4 cases of severe sepsis were seen in the group of patients who had
      received prophylactic antibiotics. The authors have compared these results with
      those obtained during the previous period when the operating room was less
      modern. They conclude that this factor is of paramount importance. On the other
      hand, they have observed 2.1 p. 100 of contaminated drains without subsequent
      infection. They are concerned at the increase of gram-negative organisms
      resistant to Cefazolin (60 p. 100) and of Staphylococci resistant to Methicillin 
      (30 p. 100). They conclude that the peroperative flash technique of the
      administration of Penicillin M is worthwhile.

TI  - Coccidioidomycosis in a 38-year-old man: a case report.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - The present article describes a case of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in a
      38-year-old man, a research worker. The disease started during the patient stay
      in Arizona, USA, and clinical symptoms persisted after his return to Poland.
      Acute coccidioidomycosis is one the clinical manifestations of Coccidioides
      immitis strain endemic infections occurring in the south-western regions of USA
      including California (mainly San Joaquin Valley), Western Texas, New Mexico and
      the desert areas of Arizona, and Central and South America. The native
      environment of Coccidioides immitis is soil penetrated by rodents. People,
      domestic and wild animals suffer from coccidioidomycosis. The infection rate in
      endemic areas is about 2-4% a year in the healthy population. Coccidioidomycosis 
      can be observed in non-endemic areas due to population mobility and in
      immunocompromised patients. The Coccidioides immitis infection is caused by
      inhaled airborne fungal spores and it may occur as primary pulmonary (acute or
      chronic) asymptomatic form, meningitis, or disseminated disease. The clinical
      symptoms of coccidioidomycotis like acute pulmonary manifestations may resemble
      typical, resistant to empiric antibiotic treatment of bacterial pneumonia. In
      healthy subjects, pulmonary coccidioidomycosis may occur as asymptomatic
      infection, which resolves spontaneously without medication. Sometimes, slight
      shadows like local fibrosis and cavities may be visible on the chest X-ray. The
      Coccidioides immitis infection in people with immunological deficiency syndromes,
      e.g. HIV/AIDS, manifests itself as disseminated disease and may lead to severe
      complications including death.

AB  - Patients with surgical wounds have been reported to be at high risk of MRSA
      carriage and infection. The prevalence and antibiotic resistance pattern of this 
      organism in the orthopaedic ward of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital
      (ABUTH), Zaria-Nigeria, a 547-bed Nigerian hospital, were thus studied. A total
      of 185 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were confirmed from 217 samples taken
      from the orthopaedic wards of the hospital using standard isolation methods. Out 
      of these, 44 (23.8%) were from the wounds of patients and 70 (37.8%) from the
      skin. The remaining 65 (35.1%) and 6 (3.2%) were from their beds and the
      atmospheric air, respectively. Out of these, 33 (75%), 36 (51.4%), and 48 (73.8%)
      from wounds, skin, and bed, respectively, were found to be methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using the disc-sensitive test methods. None was
      detected from the atmosphere. The antibiotic susceptibility pattern results
      showed the level of resistance to be ampicillin 100% in all the three sites,
      pefloxacin 90.9%, 72.2%, 66.7%, ceftriaxone 69.7%, 72.2%, 70.8%, gentamicin
      54.5%, 52.8%, 37.5%, and ciprofloxacin 51.5%, 47.2%, 35.4% at the wound, skin,
      and bed sites, respectively. Results confirm that MRSA continues to pose a threat
      to the hospitalized patients, especially those with bone and wound infections.

AB  - Size-resolved bacterial concentrations in atmospheric aerosols sampled by using a
      six stage viable impactor at rice field, sanitary landfill, and waste incinerator
      sites were determined. Culture-based and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods 
      were used to identify the airborne bacteria. The culturable bacteria
      concentration in total suspended particles (TSP) was found to be the highest (848
      Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/m(3)) at the sanitary landfill sampling site, while the
      rice field sampling site has the lowest (125 CFU/m(3)). The closed landfill would
      be the main source of the observed bacteria concentration at the sanitary
      landfill. The rice field sampling site was fully covered by rice grain with
      wetted conditions before harvest and had no significant contribution to the
      airborne bacteria concentration. This might occur because the dry conditions
      favor suspension of soil particles and this area had limited personnel and
      vehicle flow. The respirable fraction calculated by particles less than 3.3 mum
      was highest (26%) at the sanitary landfill sampling site followed by waste
      incinerator (19%) and rice field (10%), which showed a lower level of respiratory
      fraction compared to previous literature values. We identified 58 species in 23
      genera of culturable bacteria, and the Microbacterium, Staphylococcus, and
      Micrococcus were the most abundant genera at the sanitary landfill, waste
      incinerator, and rice field sites, respectively. An antibiotic resistant test for
      the above bacteria (Micrococcus sp., Microbacterium sp., and Staphylococcus sp.) 
      showed that the Staphylococcus sp. had the strongest resistance to both
      antibiotics (25.0% resistance for 32 microg ml(-1) of Chloramphenicol and 62.5%
      resistance for 4 microg ml(-1) of Gentamicin).

AB  - The goal of this paper was to establish the durability profile of antibacterial
      multilayer thin films under storage and usage conditions. Thin films were built
      on stainless steel (SS) by means of a layer-by-layer process alternating a
      negatively charged polyelectrolyte, polyacrylic acid, with a cationic
      antibacterial peptide, nisin. SS coupons coated with the antibacterial film were 
      challenged under environmental and usage conditions likely to be encountered in
      real-world applications. The change in antibacterial activity elicited by the
      challenge was used as an indicator of multilayer film resistance. Antibacterial
      SS samples could be stored for several weeks at 4 degrees C in ambient air and
      antibacterial films were resistant to dipping and mild wiping in water and
      neutral detergent. The multilayer coating showed some weaknesses, however, that
      need to be addressed.

TI  - In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis strains 
      using agar diffusion method.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - The genus Scopulariopsis is a common soil saprotroph and has been isolated from
      air, organic waste and also from plant, animal and human tissues. Scopulariopsis 
      has mainly been associated in humans with superficial mycoses, but it has also
      been described as the cause of subcutaneous and invasive infections. The most
      common aetiological agent of infections in humans is Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. 
      This species has been reported to be resistant in vitro to broad-spectrum
      antifungal agents available today. The aim of the study was to establish in vitro
      antifungal susceptibility of 35 S. brevicaulis strains against amphotericin B
      (AMB), flucytosine (FC), caspofungin (CAS), terbinafine (TER), ciclopirox (CIC), 
      voriconazole (VOR), clotrimazole (CTR), miconazole (MCZ), econazole (ECO),
      ketoconazole (KET), itraconazole (ITR), and fluconazole (FLU). Antifungal
      susceptibility tests were evaluated by an agar diffusion method (Neo-Sensitabs,
      Rosco, Denmark). AMB, FC, CAS, ITR and FLU showed no antifungal activity against 
      S. brevicaulis. TER, CIC, CTR, KET, VOR, ECO, and MCZ revealed inhibitory
      activity for S. brevicaulis, but it varied for each of the drugs. The best
      antifungal effect was observed for TER and CIC. All isolates had large inhibition
      zones for TER and CIC. CTR was also inhibitory for all tested S. brevicaulis
      isolates, but the diameters of inhibition zones were smaller than for TER and
      CIC. Nearly 89% isolates showed inhibition zones for KET and the mean diameter of
      the inhibition zone was comparable to CTR. The least antifungal activity
      exhibited VQR, ECO and MCZ. Because of the multiresistance of S. brevicaulis,
      infections due to this species may not respond to particular antifungal treatment
      and other therapeutic approaches should be considered, e.g., combined therapy
      and/or surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Air conditioning systems represent one important source of microbial 
      pollutants for indoor air. In the past few years, numerous strategies have been
      conceived to reduce the contamination of air conditioners, mainly in hospital
      settings. The biocidal detergent BATT2 represents a natural product obtained
      through extraction from brown seaweeds, that has been tested previously on
      multidrug-resistant microorganisms. METHODS: BATT2 has been utilized for the
      disinfection of fan coil units from four air conditioning systems located in
      hospital environments with a mean degree of risk. Samples were collected from the
      air supplied by the conditioning systems and from the surfaces of fan coil units,
      before and after sanitization procedures. Total microbial counts at 37 degrees C 
      and 22 degrees C and mycotic count at 32 degrees C were evaluated. Staphylococci 
      and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also detected on surfaces samples. RESULTS: The
      biodetergent was able to reduce up 50% of the microbial pollution of fan coil
      units surfaces and air supplied by the air conditioners. CONCLUSIONS: BATT2 could
      be considered for cleaning/disinfection of air conditioning systems, that should 
      be performed on the basis of accurate and verifiable sanitization protocols.

TI  - Infectious diseases in the operating room.
PG  - 8-14
AB  - Patients with infectious diseases have special implications for infection control
      in the operating room. The increased use and abuse of antibiotics has ushered in 
      a category of resistant organisms. These multiresistant organisms are spread by
      direct or indirect contact, primarily from the hands of caregivers or contact
      with contaminated environmental surfaces. Another category of infectious diseases
      is prions (pronounced pree-ons). Unlike other infectious diseases, human prions
      diseases are not spread through routine exposures such as direct contact,
      droplet, and airborne routes. The causative agent is highly resistant to
      traditional disinfecting and sterilization processes. This article provides an
      overview of the multiresistant infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus with reduced 
      susceptibility to vancomycin along with the human prions diseases
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, German-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, kuru, and fatal 
      familial insomnia. We provide a template of precautions that can be used in
      developing operating room and anesthesia infection control protocols for this
      patient population.

AB  - Compared with conventional surgical clothing, polypropylene coveralls reduced the
      bacterial contamination of the air of a conventionally ventilated operating room 
      by 62%. The contamination of surgical wounds during joint replacement was also
      reduced, but not to a significant degree. Sixteen percent of the bacteria sampled
      from the wounds were resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic and the importance 
      of a clean air system for performing joint replacement operations is stressed.
      The use of commercially available non-woven swabs for sampling bacteria from the 
      surgical wound compared favourably with the use of specially prepared velvet
      pads.

TI  - Saprophytic and cycloheximide resistant fungi isolated from golden hamster.
PG  - 195-207
AB  - Healthy hair samples from golden hamsters were examined for the presence of
      dermatophytes and non-dermatophytes using baiting technique and direct
      inoculation. Thirty-four species and 2 varieties attributed to 17 genera were
      recovered. Paecilomyces variotii (isolated from 84.4% of the examined hair) and
      Aspergillus niger (81.3%) were the more frequent isolates on Sabouraud's dextrose
      agar (SDA) without cycloheximide. Our results have clearly demonstrated that the 
      hair of hamster was free from true dermatophytes. Using the dilution plate method
      many fungal species were isolated from cage material (7 genera and 10 species + 1
      variety); from faeces (10 genera and 17 species); from standard chow (3 genera
      and 6 species) of hamster. P. variotii which was the most frequent fungus in the 
      preceding 3 substrates was completely absent in the presence of cycloheximide in 
      SDA. The present study has demonstrated for the first time the isolation of
      Trichophyton rubrum from hamster faeces. Also, several saprophytic and
      cycloheximide resistant fungi were isolated. In the air of hamster cage
      Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium chrysogenum, Alternaria alternata and
      Scopulariopsis brevicaulis were the most dominant species on SDA with or without 
      cycloheximide. Using the agar diffusion method, Aloe sap, onion oil, garlic bulb 
      extract and aqueous leaf extracts of Andropogon citratus, Euphorbia sp. and Ruta 
      graveolens were tested for their antifungal activity on 10 fungal species. It was
      observed that onion oil exhibited a high inhibitory effect against most of the
      tested fungi.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of microbial contamination in the operating room
      environment: Is there a risk for infection?
PG  - 573-9; discussion 579-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern operating rooms are considered to be aseptic environments. The
      use of surgical mask, frequent air exchanges, and architectural barriers are used
      to reduce airborne microbial populations. Breaks in surgical technique, host
      contamination, or hematogenous seeding are suggested as causal factors in these
      infections. This study implicates contamination of the operating room air as an
      additional etiology of infection. METHODS: To investigate the potential sources
      of perioperative contamination, an innovative in situ air-sampling analysis was
      conducted during an 18-month period involving 70 separate vascular surgical
      procedures. Air-sample cultures were obtained from multiple points within the
      operating room, ranging from 0.5 to 4 m from the surgical wound. Selected
      microbial clonality was determined by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. In a
      separate series of studies microbial nasopharyngeal shedding was evaluated under 
      controlled environmental conditions in the presence and absence of a surgical
      mask. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered from 86% of air
      samples, 51% from within 0.5 m of the surgical wound, whereas Staphylococcus
      aureus was recovered from 64% of air samples, 39% within 0.5 m from the wound.
      Anterior nares swabs were obtained from 11 members of the vascular team,
      clonality was observed between 8 strains of S epidermidis, and 2 strains of S
      aureus were recovered from selected team members and air-samples collected
      throughout the operating room environment. Miscellaneous Gram-negative isolates
      were recovered less frequently (<33%); however, 7 isolates expressed multiple
      patterns of antimicrobial resistance. The traditional surgical mask demonstrated 
      limited effectiveness at curtailing microbial shedding, especially during
      symptomatic periods of rhinorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-positive staphylococcal
      isolates were frequently isolated from air samples obtained throughout the
      operating room, including areas adjacent to the operative field. Nasopharyngeal
      shedding from person participating in the operation was identified as the source 
      of many of these airborne contaminants. Failure of the traditional surgical mask 
      to prevent microbial shedding is likely associated with an increased risk of
      perioperative contamination of biomedical implants, especially in procedures
      lasting longer than 90 minutes.

      maltophilia].
PG  - 127-34
AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacillus which is 
      becoming increasingly recognized as an important nosocomial pathogen especially
      in debilitated or immune suppressed patients. S. maltophilia is found in a wide
      variety of environments. It has been isolated from a number of water sources,
      soil, variety of plants and food sources. S. maltophilia can form biofilm on
      synthetic materials for temporary or permanent implantation, i.e. central venous 
      catheters, urinary catheters and prosthetic heart valves. In hospital the
      organism has been isolated from wet environments such as antiseptic fluids
      containing chlorhexidine, respiratory therapy equipment and air nebulizers.
      Little is known of the virulence factors of S. maltophilia. S. maltophilia is
      naturally resistant to many currently available broad-spectrum antimicrobial
      agents, including carbapenems. This study was carried out with the objective of
      evaluating clinical strains isolation and antibiotic susceptibility of S.
      maltophilia. A total of 80 clinical isolates of S. maltophilia were collected
      from individual patients, hospitalized at A. Jurasz University Hospital in
      Bydgoszcz, Poland. To identify S. maltophilia strains and receive biochemical
      profiles API 20 NE tests (bio Merieux) ATB Expression computer system (bio
      Merieux) with database V 2.4.7. were used. Antimicrobial agents susceptibility
      was evaluated for 19 different agents. For 18 out of 19 antimicrobial agent
      Etests (AB Biodisc) were used. For levofloxacine disc diffusion method was used. 
      Most of analyzed strains were isolated from broncho-alveolar lavage (37.5%) from 
      patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit (48.8%). 95.7% of isolated strains
      were susceptible to levofloxacine and 71,3% to trimethoprim/sulfametholxazole. 48
      (60.0%) of S. maltophilia strains were identified as multi-drug resistant.

TI  - [A case of pulmonary tuberculosis presenting with infected bulla].
PG  - 307-11
AB  - A case of pulmonary tuberculosis manifested as infected bulla complicating with
      tuberculous pneumonia is reported. A 63-year-old male visited our hospital
      because of chest X-ray abnormality detected by his home doctor. He complained of 
      pyrexia and productive cough. Chest X-ray showed large bulla with air-fluid
      level, associated with surrounding infiltration at right upper lobe. On the
      diagnosis of infected bulla empirical antibiotic therapy was started on
      out-patient basis and continued after admission, but chest X-ray findings
      worsened, although subjective symptoms were once relieved. Surgical intervention 
      was recommended, but after short interval pulmonary infiltrates rapidly worsened 
      and expanded to other lobes. Sputum was reexamined and Mycobacterium, later
      proved as Mycobacterium tuberculosis with DNA probe method, was detected in the
      sputum specimen. Anti-mycobacterial drugs were administered and subjective
      symptoms, laboratory, and chest X-ray findings improved. Infected bulla caused by
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rare, but when it is resistant to common empirical 
      therapy, Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be considered as one of its causative 
      agents.

TI  - Molecular characterisation of Hungarian macrolide-resistant Streptococcus
      pneumoniae isolates, including three highly resistant strains with the mef gene.
PG  - 488-95
AB  - The macrolide resistance of 304 Hungarian Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was
      investigated. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed in air and in 5%
      CO(2). More erythromycin resistance was noted when growth was in CO(2). A
      resistance determinant was found in almost all isolates: erm(B) gene (87.4%), mef
      genes (9.2%) and one strain with the erm(TR) gene. This indicates that screening 
      for carriage of resistance determinants should always be done in the presence of 
      5% CO(2). We found three isolates with mef(E), which were highly resistant to
      erythromycin. These contained multiple and some novel, ribosomal mutations. The
      most prevalent serogroups were 6, 19 and 14. Based on the PFGE pattern, we found 
      identity between the Hungarian isolates and two PMEN clones.

TI  - [Risk factors of surgical wound infection].
PG  - 5749-53
AB  - The risk of developing a surgical wound infection depends on the balance between 
      factors determining the number of bacteria contaminating the wound and factors
      determining the resistance of the wound against infection. Some of these factors 
      are responsive to interventive strategies, aiming at lowering the frequency of
      surgical wound infection. It has been shown, that the use of prophylactic
      antibiotics and ultraclean-air operation room techniques are beneficial in
      certain types of surgery, while the use of blood transfusion increases the risk
      of wound infection. Evidence suggests that the use of laparoscopic techniques in 
      abdominal surgery will decrease the risk of infection. Research in immunological 
      factors and hypoxia have not yet contributed any clinically applicable types of
      prophylactic strategies.

TI  - Significance of airborne transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus in an otolaryngology-head and neck surgery unit.
PG  - 644-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively investigate the existence of airborne
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a hospital environment and 
      to perform phenotyping and genotyping of MRSA isolates to study MRSA
      epidemiology. DESIGN: Prospective surveillance of patients with MRSA infections
      or colonizations was performed, as was an observational study of environmental
      airAirborne samples were taken by an air sampler; samples were obtained from
      object surfaces by stamping or swabbing. Epidemiological study of MRSA isolates
      was performed with an antibiotic susceptibility test, coagulase typing, and
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. SETTING: Three single-patient rooms in a 37-bed
      otolaryngology-head and neck surgery unit. PATIENTS: Three patients with squamous
      cell head and neck cancer were observed to have been colonized or infected with
      MRSA after surgery. RESULTS: The MRSA samples were collected from the air in
      single-patient rooms during both a period of rest and when bedsheets were being
      changed. Isolates of MRSA were detected in all stages (from stage 1 [>7 microm]
      to stage 6 [0.65-1.1 microm]). About 20% of the MRSA particles were within a
      respirable range of less than 4 microm. Methicillin-resistant S aureus was also
      isolated from inanimate environments, such as sinks, floors, and bedsheets, in
      the rooms of the patients with MRSA infections as well as from the patients'
      hands. An epidemiological study demonstrated that clinical isolates of MRSA in
      our ward were of one origin and that the isolates from the air and from inanimate
      environments were identical to the MRSA strains that caused infection or
      colonization in the inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin-resistant S aureus was
      recirculated among the patients, the air, and the inamimate environments,
      especially when there was movement in the rooms. Airborne MRSA may play a role in
      MRSA colonization in the nasal cavity or in respiratory tract MRSA infections.
      Measures should be taken to prevent the spread of airborne MRSA to control
      nosocomial MRSA infection in hospitals.

TI  - [Nocardia farcinica as the causative agent of a brain abscess in a patient with
      interstitial lung disease].
PG  - 13-20
AB  - This case report describes a two-step protocol for the identification of the
      causative agent of nocardiosis in a patient with brain abscess, antibiotic
      susceptibility testing and etiological treatment after neurosurgery. The patient 
      treated with corticosteroids for pulmonary fibrosis and presenting with multiple 
      neurological manifestations was admitted to a neurosurgery clinic. CT and
      contrast MRI revealed an expansive multilocular lesion 45 x 35 mm in size in the 
      left parietal lobe, differentially diagnosed as malignant glioma. The lesion was 
      biopsied and the histology showed a brain abscess containing white blood cells
      and dead tissue. The aspirated pus culture yielded bacteria of the genus Nocardia
      that were further identified, in the first step, by phenotypic methods (Gram
      positivity, partial acidoresistance, airborne mycelium detection, growth at 45
      degrees C, lysozyme resistance and antibiotic resistance phenotype) as belonging 
      to resistance phenotype V., v.s. N. farcinica (resistance to aminoglycosides
      except amikacin and to third-generation cephalosporins). In the second step of
      the polyphasic identification, rDNA was isolated and a 1000 bp part of the 16S
      rRNA gene was sequenced. Sequence comparison with the GenBank database using
      BLAST software identified the agent as N. farcinica (100%). The isolate was
      tested for susceptibility by the NCCLS /CLSI dilution method and showed good
      susceptibility to co-trimoxazole, amikacin and imipenem. The patient was treated 
      with long-term intravenous cotrimoxazole acid in combination with amikacin and
      his clinical condition and laboratory parameters of inflammation improved. N.
      farcinica is among the three most frequently isolated Nocardia species in Europe 
      as well as in the Czech Republic where it was repeatedly recovered from the lungs
      and respiratory tract of immunocompromised patients with systemic nocardiosis.

TI  - Suitability of electrolyzed oxidizing water for the disinfection of hard surfaces
      and equipment in radiology.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/s40201-015-0160-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitals are faced with increasingly resistant strains of
      micro-organisms. When it comes to disinfection, individual parts of electronic
      equipment of angiology diagnostics such as patient couches of computer tomography
      (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners prove to be very hard to
      disinfect. Disinfectants of choice are therefore expected to possess properties
      such as rapid, residue-free action without any damaging effect on the sensitive
      electronic equipment. This paper discusses the use of the neutral electrolyzed
      oxidizing water (EOW) as a biocide for the disinfection of diagnostic rooms and
      equipment. METHODS: The CT and MRI rooms were aerosolized with EOW using
      aerosolization device. The presence of micro-organisms before and after the
      aerosolization was recorded with the help of sedimentation and cyclone air
      sampling. Total body count (TBC) was evaluated in absolute and log values.
      RESULTS: The number of micro-organisms in hospital rooms was low as expected.
      Nevertheless, a possible TBC reduction between 78.99-92.50% or 50.50-70.60% in
      log values was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The research has shown that the use of EOW 
      for the air and hard surface disinfection can considerably reduce the presence of
      micro-organisms and consequently the possibility of hospital infections. It has
      also demonstrated that the sedimentation procedure is insufficient for the TBC
      determination. The use of Biocide aerosolization proved to be efficient and safe 
      in all applied ways. Also, no eventual damage to exposed devices or staff was
      recorded.

TI  - Avian heterophils in inflammation and disease resistance.
PG  - 972-7
AB  - Heterophils are the predominate granulated leukocyte in the acute inflammatory
      response in gallinaceous birds. Heterophils are highly phagocytic and are capable
      of a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. They accumulate in inflamed
      tissue, causing tissue damage and forming heterophil granulomas that are
      morphologically similar to inflammatory lesions in reptiles. The avian heterophil
      lacks myeloperoxidase and depends primarily on nonoxidative mechanisms for
      antimicrobial activity. The beta-defensins found in heterophil granules can kill 
      a wide variety of bacterial pathogens and are a major component of the heterophil
      antimicrobial arsenal. Heterophils form the first line of cellular defense
      against invading microbial pathogens in the lungs and air sacs where resident
      macrophages are lacking.

TI  - Individual bone cement spacers (IBCS) for septic hip revision-preliminary report.
PG  - 254-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two-stage septic hip revision with intermediate resection
      arthroplasty leads to temporary poor function and difficult reimplantation.
      Antibiotic-loaded cement spacers improve patient mobility and maintain stability 
      of the joint as well as length of the limb. Prefabricated spacers are readily
      available but lack adaptability. We developed modular moulds separately for stem 
      and head to create more individual spacers with optimised femoral press-fit and
      smooth head surface. METHODS: Moulds are fabricated preoperatively by forming 4
      mm polyethylene over trial stems and cups under vacuum (MS 30, Centerpulse,
      Switzerland). After gas sterilization, Refobacin Palacos (Merck, Darmstadt,
      Germany) is poured into stem and head moulds of appropriate size. A double K-wire
      is inserted as a rod. Fluoroscopy is used to check for air inclusions, which
      might impair resistance. For mechanical resistance testing trials, 5 spacers were
      resin-fixed with 80% stem insertion and loaded in a craniocaudal direction at 20 
      N/s (universal testing machine, Zwick, Germany) until failure. RESULTS: The
      static testing showed an average failure load of 1550 N (range 1350-2000 N). The 
      K-wires prevented complete dislocation of the fragments. CONCLUSION: Partial
      weight-bearing is possible with this system, but a fall might lead to an acute
      fracture. New materials for the core can be tested with our biomechanical model. 
      Following the presented craniocaudal static testing, torsion testing and dynamic 
      testing in Ringer's solution are planned.

TI  - Vancomycin bonded to bone grafts prevents bacterial colonization.
PG  - 487-94
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00741-10 [doi]
AB  - Infection is an important medical problem associated with the use of bone
      allografts. To retard bacterial colonization, we have recently reported on the
      modification of bone allografts with the antibiotic vancomycin (VAN). In this
      report, we examine the ability of this antibiotic-modified allograft to resist
      bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. When antibiotic was coupled to the 
      allograft, a uniform distribution of the antibiotic was apparent. Following
      challenges with Staphylococcus aureus for 6 h, the covalently bonded VAN
      decreased colonization as a function of inoculum, ranging from 0.8 to 2.0 log(10)
      CFU. Furthermore, the VAN-modified surface resisted biofilm formation, even in
      topographical niches that provide a protected environment for bacterial adhesion.
      Attachment of the antibiotic to the allograft surface was robust, and the bonded 
      VAN was stable whether incubated in aqueous media or in air, maintaining levels
      of 75 to 100% of initial levels over 60 days. While the VAN-modified allograft
      inhibited the Gram-positive S. aureus colonization, in keeping with VAN's
      spectrum of activity, the VAN-modified allograft was readily colonized by the
      Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Finally, initial toxicity measures indicated that
      the VAN-modified allograft did not influence osteoblast colonization or
      viability. Since the covalently tethered antibiotic is stable, is active, retains
      its specificity, and does not exhibit toxicity, it is concluded that this
      modified allograft holds great promise for decreasing bone graft-associated
      infections.

TI  - Effects of ceftiofur treatment on the susceptibility of commensal porcine
      E.coli--comparison between treated and untreated animals housed in the same
      stable.
PG  - 265
LID - 10.1186/s12917-015-0578-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy farm animals have been found to act as a reservoir of
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli).
      Therefore, the objective of the study was to determine the input of antimicrobial
      active ceftiofur metabolites in the stable via faeces and urine after
      intramuscular administration of the drug to pigs and the elucidation of the
      Escherichia coli ESBL resistance pattern of treated and untreated pigs housed in 
      the same barn during therapy. METHODS: For determination of the minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) the method of microdilutionaccording to the
      recommended procedure of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute was
      used. Inaddition to that, a qualitative determination was performed by agar
      dilution. Unsusceptible E. coli speciesselected via agar dilution with cefotaxime
      were confirmed by MALDI-TOF and ESBL encoding genes wereidentified by PCR. The
      amounts of ceftiofur measured as desfuroylceftiofur (DFC) in the different probes
      (plasma, urine, faeces and dust) were analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: In a first
      experiment two groups of pigs (6 animals per group) were housed in the same barn 
      in two separated boxes. One group (group B) were treated with ceftiofur according
      to the licence (3 mg/kg administered intramuscularly (i.m.) on three consecutive 
      days, day 1-3). During a second treatment period (day 29-31) an increased rate of
      ESBL resistant E. coli was detectable in these treated pigs and in the air of the
      stable. Moreover, the second group of animals (group A) formerly untreated but
      housed for the whole period in the same stable as the treated animals revealed
      increased resistance rates during their first treatment (day 45-47) with
      ceftiofur. In order to investigate the environmental input of ceftiofur during
      therapy and to simulate oral uptake of ceftiofur residues from the air of the
      stable a second set of experiments were performed. Pigs (6 animals) were treated 
      with an interval of 2 weeks for 3 days with different doses of ceftiofur (3
      mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg i.m.) as well as with 3 mg/kg per os) and the renal 
      and biliary excretion of ceftiofur as its active metabolite were measured in
      comparison to the plasma levels. In addition to that, probes of the sedimentation
      dust and the air of the stable were analysed for drug residues. CONCLUSION: The
      present study shows that treatment of several animals in a stable with ceftiofur 
      influences the resistance pattern of intestinal Escherichia coli of the treated
      as well as untreated animals housed in the same stable. During therapy with the
      drug which was administered by injection according to the licence we detected
      nameable amounts of ceftiofur and its active metabolites in the dust and air of
      the stable.

TI  - Morphological and cellular basis for airflow limitation in smokers.
PG  - 1505-15
AB  - Airflow limitation has two well-defined components, increased resistance, which
      is found predominantly in the small airways, and loss of elastic recoil. Small
      airways contribute to the increased resistance to flow by the narrowing of the
      airway lumen. Morphometric studies have shown that smokers have increased
      epithelial abnormalities, cellular inflammatory infiltrates in the airway wall,
      increased muscle and fibrosis, when compared with nonsmokers. Along with these
      anatomical changes, an increased percentage of airways < 400 microns in diameter 
      is found. In addition to the measured changes, other nonmeasurable, dynamic
      events occur in the airways of smokers, which further decrease lumen diameter.
      There is ample evidence to show that the airways of smokers react to nonspecific 
      stimuli by constricting, which results in increased resistance and decreased
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The pathological changes found in 
      smokers, that could be responsible for active muscle constriction and airway
      narrowing include: 1) airway epithelial damage, resulting in increased
      permeability and impairment of other epithelial function; 2) chronic airway
      inflammation; 3) structural changes in the airway wall; and 4) loss of alveolar
      attachments. However, not all smokers develop the abovementioned airway
      abnormalities. We describe how smokers could develop either centrilobular
      emphysema (CLE), or panlobular emphysema (PLE). We have found that smokers with
      CLE have more abnormal and narrower small airways, and flow limitation is
      correlated with the small airway abnormalities and not with loss of recoil. In
      contrast, smokers with PLE have much less severe airway abnormalities, diffuse
      emphysema that can be detected microscopically at a stage when FEV1 might be only
      mildly abnormal, and early changes in elastic recoil as evidenced by the changes 
      in the pressure-volume curve of the lung. Furthermore, in PLE, airflow limitation
      is correlated with loss of recoil but not with abnormalities in the small
      airways. We believe that the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the two
      types of emphysema in smokers are different; an airborne mechanism for CLE,
      possibly related to airway hyperresponsiveness, and a bloodborne mechanism for
      PLE, which may be related to dysfunction of alpha 1-antiproteases. We conclude
      that the separation of smokers based on their emphysema type is essential if we
      are to understand the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) in these subjects.

TI  - A world wide public health problem: the principal re-emerging infectious
      diseases.
PG  - e93-8
AB  - The extraordinary progress in the knowledge of infectious disease, the discovery 
      of antibiotics and effective vaccines are among the great achievement of the
      nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These achievement have led to a dramatic
      reduction in the levels of mortality from these diseases. According to the World 
      Health Organization, the term "re-emerging infectious diseases" refers to
      infectious diseases, which although well known, have not been of recent public
      health importance. However, climate change, migration, changes in health
      services, antibiotic resistance, population increase, international travel, the
      increase in the number of immune-depressed patients ,etc have lead to the
      re-emergence of these diseases. The climate changes are exposing sectors of the
      population to inadequate fresh air, water, food and resources for survival which,
      in consequence, provoke increases in both internal and international migration.
      In this particular period in which we find ourselves, characterized by
      globalization, the international community has become aware that the re-emergence
      of these diseases poses an important risk for public health underlines the
      necessity to adopt appropriate strategies for their prevention and control. The
      re-emerging diseases of the twenty-first century are a serious problem for public
      health and even though there has been enormous progress in medical science and in
      the battle against infectious diseases, they are still a long way from being
      really brought under control. A well organized monitoring system would enable the
      epidemiological characteristics of the infectious diseases to be analyzed and the
      success or otherwise of preventive interventions to be precisely evaluated. For
      this reason, the World Health Organization and the European Union have discussed 
      the formation of a collaborative network for the monitoring and control of
      re-emerging diseases and has initiated special programmes. The battle between
      humanity and infectious disease has a history lasting thousands of years and is
      destined to continue in the future emphasizing the need to adopt combined
      policies for the prevention and control of re-emerging diseases.

AB  - Acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and
      its early recognition and management still poses a challenge due to potentially
      serious consequences. The incidences of extracranial and intracranial suppurative
      complications of AOM in children have decreased significantly, yet they remain a 
      serious clinical problem, especially when caused by bacteria resistant to
      antibiotics. The authors presented a case of rare AOM complication - zygomatic
      abscess with temporal myositis. A 6-year-old boy was admitted to the ENT
      Department with 4 weeks of ear pain, treated for AOM with cefuroxime axetyl and
      amoxicilline, with acute mastoiditis and subsequent abscess formation in
      zygomatic and preauricular region. The inflammatory process spread through
      anterior air cells to the zygomatic cells leading to a fistula formation in the
      zygomatic bone and breakthrough into the temporal muscle. The surgical procedures
      applied were: myringotomy with drainage, cortical mastoidectomy and revision of
      zygomatic area and treatment with antibiotics (ceftriaxon). Enterococcus faecalis
      and Streptococcus viridans were found in the culture of middle ear and mastoid
      effusion. After half a year of follow-up the child had a normal hearing. Severe
      complications of AOM are rare today. An early diagnosis in order to promote
      adequate management and prevent inherently suppurative complications is
      essential.

PG  - 95-106
AB  - The distribution of Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or 
      gentamicin was studied in an isolation unit for patients undergoing bone marrow
      transplantation. During 1 week all such strains colonizing patients or staff
      members or found on the clothes of staff or in the air were investigated.
      Antibiograms and plasmid profiles were used for epidemiological typing.
      Thirty-one different antibiograms were found. A few strains were widely spread
      and dominated quantitatively. Staff colonization was 23%, but contamination of
      their clothes was 82%. Two strains which colonized three of the patients were
      widely spread in the air. They were found in the corridor and in every patient
      room, even where the patient was not colonized. The main source of the
      environmental contamination seems to have been patients. Possible routes of
      infection were direct airborne transmission as well as passive transfer via
      staff.

TI  - Microbiological quality assessment of natural therapeutic herbal drug products
      prepared locally in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
PG  - 140-3
AB  - One hundred and eighty one liquid and 183 powder preparations were purchased from
      different herbalists practising in open air markets in Hala District Dar es
      Salaam Region and analysed for total viable aerobic plate counts. Isolated
      microorganisms were identified by conventional microbiological and biochemical
      methods. The study revealed that the level of bacterial contamination in both
      liquid and powder drug samples was significantly higher (P <0.01) compared to the
      acceptable levels of 105/cfc/g. For fungi, the level of contamination in powders 
      was highly significant (P <0.02) while in liquids the levels were not significant
      (P <0.2) when compared to the acceptable levels of 104/cfc/g. In both
      preparations, two potentially pathogenic organisms, Klebsiella spp. and
      Pseudomonas spp., were isolated. The level of contamination with these bacteria
      was significantly high (P <0.01) in both preparations. Other pathogenic micro
      notorganisms recovered were Candida spp. and Escherichia coll The level of
      contamination with these agents was significantly high (P < 0.01) in the powders.
      These results indicate that liquid and powder herbal preparations commonly sold
      by traditional herbalists in open air markets in Dar es Salaam are frequently
      contaminated by bacteria and fungi. Some of these microbial contaminants are
      potential pathogens of man, and may thus predispose the patients taking these
      preparations to the risk of acquiring infections. These contaminated medicinal
      preparations may also facilitate transfer of strains of microorganisms which
      harbour antibiotic resistance genes. In view of these findings, it is recommended
      to conduct further studies to find out how these herbalists collect, prepare,
      store and dispense the drugs. Attempts should also be made to train traditional
      herbalists the fundamental aspects of Good Manufacturing Practices, with a view
      to improving their skills in proper handling of drugs in order to minimise
      chances of contamination.

TI  - Dual-mode triboelectric nanogenerator for harvesting water energy and as a
      self-powered ethanol nanosensor.
PG  - 6440-8
LID - 10.1021/nn501983s [doi]
AB  - When water is passing through the air or an insulating tube, it will contain not 
      only the mechanical energy but also the electrostatic energy due to the existence
      of triboelectric charges on its surface as a result of contact with the air/solid
      surface. In this paper, a hybrid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is designed
      to simultaneously harvest the electrostatic and mechanical energies of flowing
      water. Water-TENG, mainly constructed by a superhydrophobic TiO2 layer with
      hierarchical micro/nanostructures, is used to collect the electrostatic energy of
      water (Output 1). Contact-TENG, composed by a polytetrafluoroethylene film and a 
      layer of assembled SiO2 nanoparticles, is used to collect the mechanical energy
      of water (Output 1 and Output 2). Using TiO2 nanomaterials in water-TENG provides
      the advantages of photocatalytic activity and antibacterial property for water
      purification. Under the impact of a water stream from a household faucet at a
      flowing rate of 40 mL s(-1), the generated short-circuit current from Output 1
      and Output 2 of dual-mode TENG can reach 43 and 18 muA, respectively. The
      instantaneous output power densities from Output 1 and Output 2 of dual-mode TENG
      are 1.31 and 0.38 W m(-2), respectively, when connecting to a load resistor of 44
      MOmega. The rectified outputs have been applied to drive light-emitting diodes
      and charge commercial capacitors. Besides, the water-TENG has also been
      demonstrated as a self-powered nanosensor for ethanol detection.

TI  - Synergistic effect of fosfomycin and arbekacin on a methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus-induced biofilm in a rat model.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - Biofilms are a major concern for clinicians in the treatment of infectious
      disease because of the resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Using a rat air
      pouch model, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) growing as a
      biofilm was treated with a combination of fosfomycin (FOM) and arbekacin (ABK) or
      by the agents alone. This model has the advantage of permitting frequent sampling
      of exudates for bacterial counts and anti-bacterial activity, and morphological
      examination of the biofilm structure and inflammatory process in the pouch
      tissues. A clear synergistic effect was observed in the rats treated with a
      combination of fosfomycin and arbekacin. Morphological studies using scanning
      electron microscopy and histological staining showed dramatic changes of the
      biofilm structure as well as the inflammatory response in the rats. These results
      suggested an enhancement of bactericidal activity of arbekacin penetrating
      through the biofilm layer by virtue of fosfomycin. A possible mechanism of the
      synergistic effect is discussed.

TI  - Biofilm formation by Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 121-6
AB  - Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11637 produces a water-insoluble biofilm when grown
      under defined conditions with a high carbon:nitrogen ratio in continuous culture 
      and in 10% strength Brucella broth supplemented with 3 g l-1 glucose. Biofilm
      accumulated at the air/liquid interface of the culture. Light microscopy of
      frozen sections of the biofilm material showed few bacterial cells in the mass of
      the biofilm. The material stained with periodic acid Schiff's reagent. Fucose,
      glucose, galactose, and glycero-manno-heptose, N-acetylglucosamine and
      N-acetylmuramic acid were identified in partially purified and in crude material,
      using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The sugar composition strongly
      indicates the presence of a polysaccharide as a component of the biofilm
      material. Antibodies (IgG) to partially purified material were found in both
      sero-positive and sero-negative individuals. Treatment of the biofilm material
      with periodic acid reduced or abolished immunoreactivity. Treatment with 5 mol
      l-1 urea at 100 degrees C and with phenol did not remove antigenic recognition by
      patient sera. The production of a water-insoluble biofilm by H. pylori may be
      important in enhancing resistance to host defence factors and antibiotics, and in
      microenvironmental pH homeostasis facilitating the growth and survival of H.
      pylori in vivo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caught in buildings are a major global cause of sickness
      and mortality. Understanding how infections spread is pivotal to public health
      yet current knowledge of indoor transmission remains poor. AIM: To review the
      roles of natural ventilation and sunlight for controlling infection within
      healthcare environments. METHODS: Comprehensive literature search was performed, 
      using electronic and library databases to retrieve English language papers
      combining infection; risk; pathogen; and mention of ventilation; fresh air; and
      sunlight. Foreign language articles with English translation were included, with 
      no limit imposed on publication date. FINDINGS: In the past, hospitals were
      designed with south-facing glazing, cross-ventilation and high ceilings because
      fresh air and sunlight were thought to reduce infection risk. Historical and
      recent studies suggest that natural ventilation offers protection from
      transmission of airborne pathogens. Particle size, dispersal characteristics and 
      transmission risk require more work to justify infection control practices
      concerning airborne pathogens. Sunlight boosts resistance to infection, with
      older studies suggesting potential roles for surface decontamination.
      CONCLUSIONS: Current knowledge of indoor transmission of pathogens is inadequate,
      partly due to lack of agreed definitions for particle types and mechanisms of
      spread. There is recent evidence to support historical data on the effects of
      natural ventilation but virtually none for sunlight. Modern practice of designing
      healthcare buildings for comfort favours pathogen persistence. As the number of
      effective antimicrobial agents declines, further work is required to clarify
      absolute risks from airborne pathogens along with any potential benefits from
      additional fresh air and sunlight.

      rough colonies, consisting of two morphologically and physiologically different
      kinds of organisms, named primary colony organisms and secondary colony
      organisms. The primary colony organisms were slow-growing and
      cycloheximide-resistant as compared with the secondary ones which, like the
      parent organisms, were fast-growing in the absence of cycloheximide, but were
      inhibited when cycloheximide was incorporated in the medium. Cell aggregates,
      large swollen cells, and dwarf cells were found among the secondary colony
      organisms. The primary colony organisms were smaller than normal cells but were
      larger than the dwarf cells. The primary colony organisms also proved to have
      lost the faculty to sporulate, whereas the secondary colony organisms sporulated 
      like the untreated parents. In contrast to the normal organisms and the secondary
      colony organisms, the primary colony organisms did not consume oxygen in
      manometric experiments with glucose as a substrate. On solid medium without
      cycloheximide, the latter organisms grew considerably better in a nitrogen
      atmosphere than in air.

AB  - The Source of infectious bacteria is the first problem in provension of infection
      considered by the medical workers. In this paper, with the method of bacteria
      plasmid analysis, chromosome DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism
      analysis, drug resistance experiment (antibacterial drug, sterilizing drug) and
      so on. We confirmed that staphylococci of nosocomi is mainly from air; but the
      gram-negative bacteria is mainly from the patient's pharyngeal portion; and cause
      hospital infection indirectly. The drug resistance of gram-negative from air was 
      lower than the same gram-negative bacilli's isolated from the patient. Moreover, 
      kill bacteria the infectious strain is same strain in air. Above-mentioed results
      provided the important basis for control of the hoslpital infection.

AB  - Two naturally occurring, generally recognized as safe compounds, namely, caprylic
      acid (CA) (1%) and b -resorcylic acid (BR) (1%), and their combination, applied
      at 23 and 60 degrees C were evaluated for their antimicrobial effects against
      Escherichia coli O157:H7 on cattle hides in the presence and absence of bovine
      feces. Fresh cleaned cattle hides were cut into pieces (5 cm(2)), air dried, and 
      inoculated with a five-strain mixture of nalidixic acid-resistant (50 mug/ml) E. 
      coli O157:H7 ( approximately 8.0 log CFU). The hide samples were air dried under 
      a biosafety hood for 2 h and sprayed with 95% ethanol, 1% CA, 1% BR, or a mixture
      of 1% CA and 1% BR at 23 or 60 degrees C. The hide samples were kept at 23
      degrees C, and E. coli O157:H7 populations were determined at 2 and 5 min after
      treatment. Both CA and BR were effective in decreasing E. coli O157:H7
      populations on hides by 3 to 4 log CFU/cm(2) (P < 0.05). Sterile bovine feces had
      no effect on the decontaminating property of CA and BR on cattle hides (P >
      0.05). Results of this study indicate that CA and BR could potentially be used to
      decontaminate cattle hides, but follow-up research under slaughterhouse
      conditions is warranted.

TI  - Induction of gentamicin resistance by visible light.
PG  - 952-5
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of visible light or phototherapy to 
      modify the intracellular DNA of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The present
      study was undertaken to determine the effect of light used in phototherapy on
      antibiotic resistance in prokaryotic cells using tester strains of
      gentamicin-sensitive Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. A growing
      population of the tester microorganisms was inoculated on plates containing
      nutrient medium and gentamicin. Experiments were performed to determine the
      effect of blue light on the induction of gentamicin-resistant mutants. The plates
      were divided into two populations, one of which was illuminated, while the other 
      was kept in the dark to serve as a control. During photoirradiation, the plates
      were protected from direct sunlight and air coded to maintain a temperature of 27
      degrees C. The sample distance from the light source was adjusted to maintain a
      fluence rate (450 nm) of 141 uW/cm2. Control experiments were performed to
      investigate the effect of photoirradiation on the media and gentamicin. An
      increased frequency of mutation to gentamicin resistance was seen in the
      irradiated population of bacteria. The mutagenic effect was observed over a wide 
      range of gentamicin concentrations and correlated in a linear fashion with
      increasing duration of photoirradiation. There was an inverse correlation between
      the size of the bacterial inoculum and the recovery of mutant bacteria.

TI  - THE MECHANISM OF AERIAL DISINFECTION BY GLYCOLS AND OTHER CHEMICAL AGENTS : II.
      AN ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS GOVERNING THE EFFICIENCY OF CHEMICAL DISINFECTION OF
      THE AIR.
PG  - 741-57
AB  - The effectiveness of any compound as an aerial germicide depends upon the extent 
      of condensation of its vapor on air-suspended bacteria, and on the rate at which 
      the resulting concentration of germicide can produce death of the microorganisms.
      The properties of any compound conducive to production of the highest rate of
      kill of air-borne microorganisms by means of the smallest possible concentration 
      of germicide vapor, are as folows: (a) a low vapor pressure, but not lower than
      0.001 mm. Hg at 25 degrees C.; (b) high hygroscopicity; (c) toxicity for
      bacterial metabolism-a high degree of potency is not necessary although the
      killing action will be more efficient the higher the antibacterial activity of
      the compound employed. For any compound the killing action is always a direct
      function of the concentration of its vapor in the air. The maximum amount of a
      hygroscopic substance which can exist in the vapor state decreases as the
      relative humidity increases. Hence, at high relative humidities the bactericidal 
      efficiency is lowest. At lower relative humidities the air can contain more
      vapor, and hence a greater effect is possible. At any relative humidity, the
      killing action is greater, the more closely the germicide vapor concentration
      approaches the saturation point. The presence of soluble compounds in droplets
      containing bacteria promotes more extensive condensation of the germicide than
      would otherwise occur, and so enhances its effectiveness. In the absence of such 
      soluble substances, low atmospheric humidities may cause complete desiccation of 
      a bacterial particle. Under these conditions its surface may become resistant to 
      the condensation of the vapor, and thus prevent effective germicidal action. The 
      influence of temperature changes on the killing efficiency maybe correctly
      deduced from a consideration of the effect of a rise in temperature on the vapor 
      pressure of the germicide and on the rate of its bactericidal action in vitro.
      Equations are presented for estimating quantitatively the magnitude of some of
      the effects discussed.

TI  - Indoor air bacterial load and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates in
      operating rooms and surgical wards at jimma university specialized hospital,
      southwest ethiopia.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection is the second most common health care
      associated infection. One of the risk factors for such infection is bacterial
      contamination of operating rooms' and surgical wards' indoor air. In view of
      that, the microbiological quality of air can be considered as a mirror of the
      hygienic condition of these rooms. Thus, the objective of this study was to
      determine the bacterial load and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates in
      operating rooms' and surgical wards' indoor air of Jimma University Specialized
      Hospital. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted to measure indoor air
      microbial quality of operating rooms and surgical wards from October to January
      2009/2010 on 108 indoor air samples collected in twelve rounds using purposive
      sampling technique by Settle Plate Method (Passive Air Sampling following 1/1/1
      Schedule). Sample processing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done
      following standard bacteriological techniques. The data was analyzed using SPSS
      version 16 and interpreted according to scientifically determined baseline values
      initially suggested by Fisher. RESULTS: The mean aerobic colony counts obtained
      in OR-1(46cfu/hr) and OR-2(28cfu/hr) was far beyond the set 5-8cfu/hr acceptable 
      standards for passive room. Similarly the highest mean aerobic colony counts of
      465cfu/hr and 461cfu/hr were observed in Female room-1 and room-2 respectively
      when compared to the acceptable range of 250-450cfu/hr. In this study only 3
      isolates of S. pyogenes and 48 isolates of S. aureus were identified. Over 66% of
      S. aureus was identified in Critical Zone of Operating rooms. All isolates of S. 
      aureus showed 100% and 82.8% resistance to methicillin and ampicillin
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Higher degree of aerobic bacterial load was measured
      from operating rooms' and surgical wards' indoor air. Reducing foot trafficking, 
      improving the ventilation system and routine cleaning has to be made to maintain 
      the aerobic bacteria load with in optimal level.

      environmental Listeria monocytogenes.
PG  - 555-64
LID - 10.1111/jam.12239 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The effects of gaseous ozone and open air factor (OAF) on environmental
      Listeria monocytogenes attached to three common food contact surfaces were
      investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Listeria monocytogenes on different food
      contact surfaces was treated with ozone and OAF. Microbiological counts, scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed. Ozone
      at 10 ppm gave <1-log reduction when L. monocytogenes was attached to stainless
      steel, while 45 ppm gave a log reduction of 3.41. OAF gave better log reductions 
      than 10 ppm ozone, but lower log reductions than 45 ppm. Significant differences 
      were found between surfaces. Biofilm organisms were significantly more resistant 
      than those surface attached on stainless steel. SEM and AFM demonstrated
      different membrane and cell surface modifications following ozone or OAF
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The strain used demonstrated higher resistance to ozone
      than previous studies. This may be due to the fact that it was isolated from a
      food manufacturing premises that used oxidizing disinfectants. OAF was more
      effective at reducing the levels of the organism than an ozone concentration of
      10 ppm. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pathogen management strategies must
      account for resistance of environmental strains when validating cleaning and
      disinfection. OAF has shown potential for surface decontamination compared with
      ozone. SEM and AFM are valuable tools for determining mechanisms of action of
      antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Altered susceptibility to air sampling stress by filtration is related to
      colistin resistance development in Acinetobacter baumannii.
LID - 10.1111/ina.12487 [doi]
AB  - The accurate quantification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in indoor air has
      recently attracted increasing attention. Here, we investigated whether the
      susceptibility of a nosocomial infection-related microbe, Acinetobacter
      baumannii, to strong sampling stress caused by Nuclepore filter changes as it
      develops resistance to a drug called colistin. Both colistin-sensitive A.
      baumannii (CSAB) and colistin-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) are generally
      desiccation-resistant strains that can be collected by filter sampling. However, 
      the resistance of CRAB to the three combined stresses (aerosolization, impaction,
      and desiccation) caused by filter sampling was 1.8 times lower than that of CSAB 
      (P < 0.05). The sampling stresses caused by filter sampling not only reduced the 
      culturability of A. baumannii but also destroyed proteins to result in cellular
      protein leakage. CRAB released 17%-38% more extracellular protein than did CSAB
      when they were both subjected to desiccation stress for 240 minutes (P < 0.01).
      The combination of using a sampling flow rate of 20 L/min and sampling for 60
      minutes with a Nuclepore filter with open-face cassettes (OFCs) is recommended
      for collecting airborne A. baumannii. A Nuclepore filter operated with
      closed-face cassettes (CFCs) significantly decreased the culturability of CRAB
      due to desiccation effects.

TI  - A brief history of infection control - past and present.
PG  - 1161-4
AB  - The scientific study of hospital or nosocomial cross-infection began during the
      first half of the 18th century, and from that time until the start of the
      'Bacteriological Era' many of the most notable contributions originated in
      Scotland. However it was only 100 years later in 1858 that Florence Nightingale
      promoted the case for hospital reform. The real understanding of hospital
      infection followed upon the discoveries of Pasteur, Koch and Lister and the
      beginning of the 'Bacteriological Era'. The close of the 19th century saw the
      triumphs of hospital reform and asepsis and seemed to herald the final victory
      over hospital cross-infection. However, the victory was short-lived. It was soon 
      realised that infections occurred not only in obstetric and surgical patients,
      but in medical patients as well, and that air could also be a source of
      infection. Streptococcal, staphylococcal and then Gram-negative bacilli as a
      cause of hospital infection became a focus of attention, as did
      antibiotic-resistant organisms. This paper looks briefly at the establishment of 
      the control of infection doctor, infection control committee and infection
      control nurse as well as summarising the changes, problems and advances in
      infection control up to the present time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and
      characterization of Listeria species and Listeria monocytogenes isolated from raw
      fish and open-air fish market environments. Eight hundred and sixty two samples
      including raw fish and fish market environments (samples from workers' hands,
      workers' knives, containers and work surface) were collected from the open-air
      fish markets in the Northern region of Iran. RESULTS: Listeria spp. was isolated 
      from 104/488 (21.3%) raw fish and 29/374 (7.8%) of samples from open-air fish
      market environment. The isolates of Listeria spp. included L. innocua (35.3%), L.
      monocytogenes (32.3%), L. seeligeri (18%), and L. ivanovii (14.3%). Of the 43 L. 
      monocytogenes isolates, 31 (72.1%), 10 (23.3%) and 2 (4.7%) belonged to serovars 
      1/2a, 4b, and 1/2b, respectively. The inlA, inlB, inlC, inlJ, actA, hlyA, iap,
      plcA, and prfA virulence-associated genes were detected in almost all of the L.
      monocytogenes isolates. The Listeria spp. isolates showed high resistance against
      tetracycline (23.3%), penicillin G, and cephalothin (each 16.5%). Besides, we
      observed significant resistance level to tetracycline (27.9%), ampicillin
      (20.9%), cephalothin, penicillin G, and streptomycin (each 16.3%) in the L.
      monocytogenes isolates. All of the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime,
      gentamicin, kanamycin, and pefloxacin. We found that tetM (25.6%), tetA (23.3%), 
      ampC (14%), and penA (11.6%) were the most prevalent antibiotic resistance genes 
      in the L. monocytogenes isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of potentially pathogenic
      L. monocytogenes from raw fish and environment of open-air fish market samples in
      this study is a convincing evidence for the zoonotic potential of listeriosis.

TI  - Azithromycin maintains airway epithelial integrity during Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      infection.
PG  - 62-8
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2008-0357OC [doi]
AB  - Tight junctions (TJs) play a key role in maintaining bronchial epithelial
      integrity, including apical-basolateral polarity and paracellular trafficking.
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis
      (CF) often suffer from chronic infections by the opportunistic Gram-negative
      bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces multiple virulence factors,
      including rhamnolipids. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (azm) has been
      shown to improve lung function in patients with CF without reducing the bacterial
      count within the lung. However, the mechanism of this effect is still debated. It
      has previously been shown that azm increased transepithelial electrical
      resistance (TER) in a bronchial epithelial cell line. In this study we used an
      air-liquid interface model of human airway epithelia and measured TER, changes in
      TJ expression and architecture after exposure to live P. aeruginosa PAO1, and
      PAO1-Deltarhl which is a PAO1 mutant lacking rhlA and rhlB, which encode key
      enzymes for rhamnolipid production. In addition, the cells were challenged with
      bacterial culture medium conditioned by these strains, purified rhamnolipids, or 
      synthetic 3O-C(12)-HSL. Virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduced TER
      and caused TJ rearrangement in the bronchial epithelium, exposing the epithelium 
      to further bacterial infiltration. Pretreatment of the bronchial epithelium with 
      azm attenuated this effect and facilitated epithelial recovery. These data
      suggest that azm protects the bronchial epithelium during P. aeruginosa infection
      independent of antimicrobial activity, and could explain in part the beneficial
      results seen in clinical trials of patients with CF.

TI  - Airborne antibiotic resistant and nonresistant bacteria and fungi recovered from 
      two swine herd confined animal feeding operations.
PG  - 699-706
AB  - Inhalation of microorganisms could be a health concern for workers inside and
      downwind of animal confinement units. Using the Andersen two-stage viable
      microbial particle sizing sampler, air samples were collected from locations
      upwind, inside, and downwind during two visits to two swine herd confined animal 
      feeding operations. Six samples were taken at each location on each site.
      Bacteria isolated from each site were then tested for antibiotic resistance using
      the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Resistant bacterial forms were found
      inside and downwind of the swine confinement facilities, indicating that
      resistant organisms were being produced in and released from these facilities.
      Resistance to a battery of antibiotics including ampicillin, erythromycin,
      oxytetracycline, penicillin, tetracycline, and tylosin was found in the following
      bioaerosols: Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and fecal coliforms. The
      major conclusion reached by this study was that bacteria were recovered inside
      and downwind of these facilities in levels that previous studies had stated could
      cause a potential human health hazard.

TI  - Heterotrophic bacteria of the freshwater neuston and their ability to act as
      plasmid recipients under nutrient deprived conditions.
PG  - 15-25
LID - 10.1007/BF02540210 [doi]
AB  - Significantly higher numbers of Gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria were present
      at the air-water interface (neston) of freshwater lakes than in the bulk water.
      Neuston bacteria were distinguished as a population distinct from bacteria in the
      bulk water by a higher incidence of pigmented colony types and significantly
      greater levels of multiple resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals. The
      incidence of plasmids in 236 neuston and 229 bulk water strains were similar (14 
      and 16.2%, respectively). Nine of 168 plasmid-free strains and 2 of 14 plasmid
      carrying strains, isolated from both bulk water and neuston, acted as recipients 
      of plasmid R68.45 in plate matings with aPseudomonas aeruginosa donor strain
      PAO4032 at 21 degrees C, but at frequencies below that of matings with a
      restriction-minus recipient strain ofP. aeruginosa, strain PAO1168. In a model
      system composed of nutrient-free synthetic lake water, plasmid R68.45 was shown
      to transfer betweenP. aeruginosa strains at frequencies between 10(-3) and
      10(-5). Transconjugants were detected about 100 times more frequently at the
      interface than in the bulk water, which in part reflected a greater enrichment of
      the donor at this site. None of the aquatic isolates were able to act as
      recipients of plasmid R68.45 in this model system with strain PAO4032 as donor.
      The results suggest that under nutrient deprived conditions, the spread of
      plasmid R68.45 and similar plasmids by lateral transfer into this particular
      aquatic population would be a rare event.

TI  - Amphotericin B-induced oxidative damage and killing of Candida albicans.
PG  - 76-83
AB  - Amphotericin B (AmB) is known to bind to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, but
      the precise mechanism of its toxicity to cells is as yet poorly understood. AmB
      autooxidizes, and it is possible that its antifungal effects could result from
      oxidative damage. Exposure of protoplasts of Candida albicans to AmB under
      hypoxic conditions reduced protoplast lysis by as much as 80% compared with
      incubations in air. Protoplasts were protected from AmB-induced lysis by
      exogenous catalase and/or superoxide dismutase (SOD). Whole cells of C. albicans 
      were protected by exogenous catalase from AmB-induced leakage of [3H]leucine and 
      from killing by AmB. Cells grown on medium inducing high levels of endogenous
      catalase were resistant to AmB-induced growth inhibition. In contrast,
      AmB-induced K+ leakage was not hindered under hypoxic conditions or in the
      presence of catalase or SOD. Thus the lethal and lytic effects of AmB on C.
      albicans cells and protoplasts, but not prelethal AmB-induced K+ leakage, are
      mediated by oxidative damage.

PG  - 1005-15
AB  - We have examined background factors in MRSA infection in cases in which S. aureus
      had been isolated from sputa. The incidence of isolation of S. aureus was high
      and still increasing in expectorated sputa, and causative organisms in the cases 
      of pneumonia and autopsied lungs. A significant correlation was observed between 
      high incidence of isolation of S. aureus and abuse of third-generation cephems.
      MRSA isolation rates of inpatients was higher than that of outpatients. Among the
      inpatients such cases with severe underlying diseases and prolonged admission
      showed the highest incidence of isolation of MRSA. There seemed to be a
      correlation between distribution of patients with S. aureus and that of rooms
      with S. aureus in the air. This suggests nosocomial infection. Although MRSA was 
      frequently isolated from sputa, most cases showed no signs of infection, and this
      suggested that they had been transient colonization. Such antimicrobial agents as
      rifampicin, teicoplanin, vancomycin reveal excellent antibacterial activity
      against MRSA and minocycline, ofloxacin were moderately effective. The physician 
      must be informed of the significance of MRSA, because their understanding of MRSA
      still remains insufficient.

      interpretive compatibility with agar proportion method].
PG  - 754-66
AB  - A newly developed microdilution antimycobacterial susceptibility test, BrothMIC
      MTB (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to determine
      minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was evaluated at multisites. The test
      method utilizes air-dried microplates containing serially diluted antimicrobial
      agents and the modified Middlebrook 7H9 broth. The eight antimycobacterial agents
      tested were rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin,
      levofloxacin, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The test plates were reconstituted 
      by inoculation of 0.2 ml of cell suspensions (6 x 10(5) cells/ml) and were
      incubated at 36 degrees C in 5% to 10% CO2. The growth endpoints were visually
      read after 7-day and 10-day incubations. The reproducibility was evaluated with
      the four reference strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and were compared with 
      the agar proportion method described in the National Committee for Clinical
      Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M24-T. Of the 1,022 testings of the reference
      strains, 1,020 (99.8%) of the MICs read after 7-day incubation fell within 3 log2
      dilutions. The growth endpoints read after 7-day and 10-day incubations gave
      equal MIC ranges for the respective agents. The results obtained by the BrothMIC 
      MTB for 93 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis compared well with those
      determined by the NCCLS method with 98% to 99% agreements, except for ethambutol.
      According to the comparative analysis with the agar proportion method, the
      interpretive MIC breakpoints to discriminate between the isolates susceptible and
      resistant against the respective agents were proposed. In conclusion, this newly 
      developed microdilution test for M. tuberculosis is a practical, rapid,
      quantitative, nonradiometric alternative for the determination of MICs in
      clinical mycobacteriology laboratories.

TI  - Approach for selection of individual enteric bacteria for competitive exclusion
      in turkey poults.
PG  - 1378-82
AB  - The intentional early colonization of the intestinal tract with beneficial
      microflora, known as competitive exclusion, has been shown to successfully
      protect poultry from selected enteric pathogens. Although effective cultures have
      been produced and are available, an inexpensive, air-tolerant, and completely
      defined culture is needed. Presently, we developed an in vitro competition assay 
      to select for individual facultative anaerobes of poultry enteric origin that
      could exclude Salmonella. Using this assay, 24 isolates were selected and stored 
      individually. These 24 isolates were amplified in batch culture (tryptic soy
      broth, 4 h at 40 degrees C) and administered at final dilutions of 10, 100, or
      1,000 cfu to day-of-hatch poults. Forty-eight hours later, poults were challenged
      with 100 to 1,000 cfu antibiotic-resistance-marked Salmonella enteritidis PT 13A 
      by oral gavage. Five days later, all poults were killed, and cecal tonsils were
      aseptically removed for tetrathionate enrichment (24 h at 37 degrees C) followed 
      by selective plating with marker antibiotics. Selected lactose-negative,
      antibiotic-resistant colonies typical of Salmonella were further confirmed by
      serogrouping. Treatment-related protection ranged from 0 to 100% in three
      experiments. Greatest protection was related to the lowest concentrations of the 
      protective microflora in each experiment. These data suggest that effective
      combinations of competitive enteric microflora can be identified by appropriate
      in vitro selection methods.

AB  - A new rapid assay for detecting oseltamivir resistance in influenza virus, iART, 
      was used to test 149 clinical specimens. Results were obtained for 132, with iART
      indicating 41 as 'resistant'. For these, sequence analysis found known and
      suspected markers of oseltamivir resistance, while no such markers were detected 
      for the remaining 91 samples. Viruses isolated from the 41 specimens showed
      reduced or highly reduced inhibition by neuraminidase inhibition assay. iART may 
      facilitate broader antiviral resistance testing.

      ST208 in the emergency intensive care unit.
PG  - 1517-23
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.077503-0 [doi]
AB  - A series of clinical isolates of drug-resistant (DR) Acinetobacter baumannii with
      diverse drug susceptibility was detected from eight patients in the emergency
      intensive care unit of Tokai University Hospital. The initial isolate was
      obtained in March 2010 (A. baumannii Tokai strain 1); subsequently, seven
      isolates were obtained from patients (A. baumannii Tokai strains 2-8) and one
      isolate was obtained from an air-fluidized bed used by five of the patients
      during the 3 months from August to November 2011. The isolates were classified
      into three types of antimicrobial drug resistance patterns (RRR, SRR and SSR)
      according to their susceptibility (S) or resistance (R) to imipenem, amikacin and
      ciprofloxacin, respectively. Genotyping of these isolates by multilocus sequence 
      typing revealed one sequence type, ST208, whilst that by a DiversiLab analysis
      revealed two subtypes. All the isolates were positive for blaOXA-51-like and
      blaOXA-66, as assessed by PCR and DNA sequencing. A. baumannii Tokai strains 1-8 
      and 10 (RRR, SRR and SSR) had quinolone resistance-associated mutations in
      gyrA/parC, as revealed by DNA sequencing. The ISAba1 upstream of blaOXA-51-like
      and aminoglycoside resistance-associated gene, armA, were detected in A.
      baumannii Tokai strains 1-7 and 10 (RRR and SRR) as assessed by PCR. Among the
      genes encoding resistance-nodulation-division family pumps (adeB, adeG and adeJ) 
      and outer-membrane porins (oprD and carO), overexpression of adeB and adeJ and
      suppression of oprD and carO were seen in isolates of A. baumannii Tokai strain 2
      (RRR), as assessed by real-time PCR. Thus, the molecular characterization of a
      series of isolates of DR A. baumannii revealed the outbreak of ST208 and diverse 
      antimicrobial drug susceptibilities, which almost correlated with differential
      gene alterations responsible for each type of drug resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a structured review of good hygiene practices in infection
      control. MATERIAL: A review of existing recommendations on standard precautions, 
      isolation precautions and specific recommendations in infection control. RESULTS:
      Isolation precautions complement standard precautions when a patient is
      identified as a carrier of bacteria showing resistance to antibiotics, virulence 
      characteristics and/or epidemic potential. Full compliance with hand hygiene
      recommendations and standard precautions is mandatory as it optimizes safety when
      patient's viral and/or bacterial status is unknown. Acknowledging the routes of
      transmission, the value of individual protection equipment and good hygiene
      practices is therefore crucial in modern infection control. For specific
      micro-organisms, isolation precautions are needed against airborne, droplets
      and/or contact cross-contamination routes. Within isolation precautions, contact 
      precautions are the most widely indicated as they control the risks of
      contamination from germs involved in cutaneous or enteric infections and of
      transmission of multi-resistant bacteria (MRB). In addition, specific
      recommendations have been defined for emerging resistant MRB. CONCLUSION: MRB are
      becoming worldwide a major issue in public health. Reducing cross-contamination
      is, with lesser and better use of antibiotics, one of the main avenue in their
      control.

TI  - Biocidal textiles can help fight nosocomial infections.
PG  - 990-4
AB  - The rates of nosocomial infections, especially by those caused by antibiotic
      resistant bacteria, are increasing alarmingly over the globe. Although more
      rigorous infection control measures are being implemented, it is clear that the
      current modalities to reduce nosocomial infections are not sufficient. Textiles
      are an excellent substrate for bacterial growth under appropriate moisture and
      temperature conditions. Patients shed bacteria and contaminate their pyjamas and 
      sheets. The temperature and humidity between the patients and the bed are
      appropriate conditions allowing for effective bacterial proliferation. Several
      studies have found that personnel in contact with contaminated textiles were the 
      source of transmission of the micro-organisms to susceptible patients.
      Furthermore, it has been reported that bed making in hospitals releases large
      quantities of micro-organisms into the air, which contaminate the immediate and
      non-immediate surroundings. Contaminated textiles in hospitals can thus be an
      important source of microbes contributing to endogenous, indirect-contact, and
      aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. We hypothesize that the use
      of antimicrobial textiles, especially in those textiles that are in close contact
      with the patients, may significantly reduce bioburden in clinical settings and
      consequently reduce the risk of nosocomial infections. These textiles should
      possess broad spectrum biocidal properties. They should be safe for use and
      highly effective against antibiotic resistant micro-organisms, including those
      that are commonly involved in hospital-acquired infections, and they should not
      permit the development of resistant micro-organisms to the active compound.

TI  - Mechanism by which gamma irradiation increases the sensitivity of Salmonella
      typhimurium ATCC 14028 to heat.
PG  - 1759-63
AB  - Effects of irradiation and heating on survival of Salmonella typhimurium ATCC
      14028 were examined by measuring DNA damage and the integrity of the cytoplasmic 
      membrane. S. typhimurium cells fell into two distinct groups following heating:
      (i) heat-sensitive cells, which were rapidly inactivated at 65 degrees C and (ii)
      heat-resistant cells, which were only slowly inactivated at 65 degrees C.
      Radiation sensitivity of S. typhimurium was greater in the presence of air than
      in the presence of N2 gas (radiation doses required to inactivate 90% of the
      cells, 0.394 +/- 0.029 in air and 0.561 +/- 0.035 in N2). Recovery of the
      covalently closed circular form of plasmid pBR322 from S. typhimurium
      transformants (Ampr Tetr) was decreased by irradiation but not by heating.
      Heating prior to irradiation significantly decreased the recovery of plasmid DNA 
      without affecting survival of S. typhimurium. Transformability of the recovered
      plasmid pBR322 was affected by neither irradiation nor heating, and mutation of
      antibiotic resistance genes was not detected in S. typhimurium. Heating, but not 
      irradiation, caused destabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane, allowing
      penetration of hydrophobic dye. These results suggest that lethality of heating
      followed by irradiation for S. typhimurium was additive, reflecting
      irradiation-induced DNA damage and heat-induced membrane destabilization. When
      irradiation preceded heating in the absence of air, more cells were inactivated
      than was expected, because of heat-inactivating radiation-damaged DNA.

TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin against Haemophilus influenzae at epithelial
      lining fluid concentrations.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/1471-2180-8-23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae is one of the main aetiological agents of
      community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The primary aim of this study
      was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against H. influenzae
      clinical isolates showing different pattern of resistance in comparison with
      azithromycin and clarithromycin at 1/4 x, 1/2 x, 1 x, 2 x, 4 x minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) and to peak concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF). 
      The secondary aim was to determine the influence of CO2 enriched atmosphere on
      bacterial susceptibility. RESULTS: Telithromycin showed high activity against H. 
      influenzae, including strains susceptible to beta-lactams (n = 200),
      beta-lactamase producer (n = 50) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant
      (BLNAR) (n = 10), with MIC from < or =0.03 to 4 mg/L, and MIC50/MIC90 of 1/2 mg/L
      with susceptibility rate of 100%, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC)
      from 2 to 4-fold higher than the MIC. Azithromycin was the most active tested
      macrolide (range: 0.25 - 4 mg/L; MIC50/MIC90: 1/2 mg/L), comparable to
      telithromycin, while clarithromycin showed the highest MICs and MBCs (range: 0.25
      - 8 mg/L; MIC50/MIC90: 2/8 mg/L). In time-kill studies, telithromycin showed a
      bactericidal activity at the higher concentrations (4 - 2 x MIC and ELF) against 
      all the strains, being complete after 12 - 24 hours from drug exposition. At MIC 
      concentrations, at ambient air, bactericidal activity of telithromycin and
      azithromycin was quite similar at 12 hours, and better than that of
      clarithromycin. Besides, telithromycin and clarithromycin at ELF concentrations
      were bactericidal after 12 hours of incubation for most strains, while 24 hours
      were needed to azithromycin to be bactericidal. Incubation in CO2 significantly
      influenced the MICs and MBCs, and only slightly the in vitro killing curves.
      CONCLUSION: Telithromycin showed an in-vitro potency against H. influenzae
      comparable to azithromycin, with an in-vitro killing rate more rapid and superior
      to clarithromycin at 2X-MIC against beta-lactamase producers and BLNAR strains,
      and to azithromycin at ELF concentrations against beta-lactamase negative
      strains. Against all strains, MICs and MBCs were lower in the absence of CO2 for 
      the tested antibiotics, showing an adverse effect of incubation in a CO2
      environment. The in-vitro potency together with the tissue concentrations of the 
      antimicrobial, should be considered in predicting efficacy.

TI  - Use of physical chemistry and in vivo exposure to investigate the toxicity of
      formaldehyde bound to carbonaceous particles in the murine lung.
PG  - 1-39, discussion 41-9
AB  - Knowledge about the health effects of exposure to formaldehyde associated with
      automotive emissions is of pivotal importance in the risk assessment of this
      agent. Mobile sources emit many combustion-derived pollutants, including
      formaldehyde, in association with respirable carbon particles. Because it is
      hydrophilic, most of the inhaled formaldehyde is absorbed in the upper
      respiratory tract. However, if the organic vapor is adsorbed on respirable
      particles, formaldehyde may be deposited in the deep lung with the inhaled
      particles and may be available to interact adversely with cells along the lung
      parenchyma. On the respiratory surface, the alveolar macrophage phagocytic system
      plays the pivotal role in defending the lung against infectious agents.
      Susceptibility to respiratory infections is a relevant and sensitive indicator of
      the adverse effects of air pollution because acute and chronic exposures to a
      variety of air pollutants have been shown to decrease pulmonary antibacterial
      defenses. The goal of this research was to investigate whether exposure to
      formaldehyde decreases resistance to respiratory infections through dysfunctions 
      of the alveolar macrophage phagocytic system. The study also explored whether
      interactions between formaldehyde and respirable carbon black particles alter
      susceptibility to respiratory infections and impairment of alveolar macrophage
      phagocytosis by delivering adsorbed formaldehyde to the deep lung with the
      inhaled particles. A carbon black, Regal GR, was used in these studies as a
      surrogate for the carbonaceous core of Diesel particulate matter. This material
      was selected to represent the worst-case scenario because the carbon black was
      expected to adsorb formaldehyde strongly. To accomplish this goal, mice were
      exposed to formaldehyde and to carbon black and formaldehyde combinations;
      increased susceptibility to respiratory infections was quantified by alveolar
      macrophage-dependent intrapulmonary killing of Staphylococcus aureus after an
      inhalation challenge with the bacterium. The salient findings of the bactericidal
      studies are as follows: Fifteen parts per million (ppm)* formaldehyde impaired
      the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus when exposure followed the bacterial
      challenge. One ppm formaldehyde impaired the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus 
      when exposure preceded and was continued after the bacterial challenge.
      Coexposures to target concentrations of 3.5 mg/m3 carbon black and 2.5 ppm
      formaldehyde, or 10 mg/m3 carbon black and 5 ppm formaldehyde after the bacterial
      challenge had no effect on the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus. Preexposure
      for four hours per day for four days to target concentrations of 3.5 mg/m3 carbon
      black and 2.5 ppm formaldehyde had no effect on the intrapulmonary killing of S. 
      aureus when the assay was performed one day after the cessation of
      exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - An outbreak of infections caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to
      methicillin and aminoglycosides. II. Epidemiologic studies.
PG  - 280-7
AB  - Studies to determine the epidemiologic behavior of strains of Staphylococcus
      aureus resistant to methicillin and aminoglycosides (MARS) were conducted over a 
      period of two and one-half years, during which MARS were isolated from 201
      patients at a hospital in the midwestern United States. Most cases of infection
      or colonization with MARS (156 of 201) occurred in patients with burns. In the
      burn unit, MARS were recovered from the air, from the hair and hands of
      personnel, and from inanimate objects. Nasal (72%) and rectal (66%) colonization 
      were common among burned patients with infected or colonized burn wounds but
      occurred in only six of 74 burn unit personnel. When compared with two control
      periods, the prophylactic use of antistaphylococcal agents in patients with burns
      increased markedly at the time the outbreak began. Of the 45 patients without
      burns from whom MARS were isolated, 42 (93%) were surgical patients. MARS were
      not demonstrated in the air or environment of patients with infected surgical
      wounds. None of 334 non-burn unit hospital personnel were found to be carriers of
      MARS. Four phage types (83A, 6/75/85, 29/52/80, and 92) were recovered during the
      outbreak. A determinant of antibiotic resistance was probably transmitted among
      strains of S. aureus.

TI  - Infectious disease outbreaks in nursing homes: an unappreciated hazard for frail 
      elderly persons.
PG  - 870-6
AB  - The common occurrence and dire consequences of infectious disease outbreaks in
      nursing homes often go unrecognized and unappreciated. Nevertheless, these
      facilities provide an ideal environment for acquisition and spread of infection: 
      susceptible residents who share sources of air, food, water, and health care in a
      crowded institutional setting. Moreover, visitors, staff, and residents
      constantly come and go, bringing in pathogens from both the hospital and the
      community. Outbreaks of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection predominate in
      this setting, but outbreaks of skin and soft-tissue infection and infections
      caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria also occur with some frequency.

TI  - Air-drying beds reduce the quantities of antibiotic resistance genes and class 1 
      integrons in residual municipal wastewater solids.

AB  - This study investigated whether air-drying beds reduce antibiotic resistance gene
      (ARG) concentrations in residual municipal wastewater solids. Three
      laboratory-scale drying beds were operated for a period of nearly 100 days.
      Real-time PCR was used to quantify 16S rRNA genes, 16S rRNA genes specific to
      fecal bacteria (AllBac) and human fecal bacteria (HF183), the integrase gene of
      class 1 integrons (intI1), and five ARGs representing a cross-section of
      antibiotic classes and resistance mechanisms (erm(B), sul1, tet(A), tet(W), and
      tet(X)). Air-drying beds were capable of reducing all gene target concentrations 
      by 1 to 5 orders of magnitude, and the nature of this reduction was consistent
      with both a net decrease in the number of bacterial cells and a lack of selection
      within the microbial community. Half-lives varied between 1.5 d (HF183) and 5.4 d
      (tet(X)) during the first 20 d of treatment. After the first 20 d of treatment,
      however, half-lives varied between 8.6 d (tet(X)) and 19.3 d (AllBac), and 16S
      rRNA gene, intI1, and sul1 concentrations did not change (P > 0.05). These
      results demonstrate that air-drying beds can reduce ARG and intI1 concentrations 
      in residual municipal wastewater solids within timeframes typical of operating
      practices.

TI  - Ventilator associated pneumonia in a military deployed setting: the impact of an 
      aggressive infection control program.
PG  - S123-7; discussion S127-8
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e31816086dc [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the onset of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, there
      has been a marked increased in multidrug resistant bacterial infections among
      combat casualties. We describe the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
      before and after the implementation of aggressive infection control measures at
      the Air Force Theater Hospital in Iraq. METHODS: All patients admitted to the
      intensive care unit (ICU) were followed prospectively for the development of VAP.
      Baseline VAP rate was determined in May 2006, and preventive measures were
      implemented by June 2006. Interventions included hand hygiene, contact barrier
      precautions, patient and staff cohorting, chlorhexidine oral care, and reducing
      the duration and spectrum of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis. Additionally,
      each ICU tent was closed periodically for cleaning and disinfection. Daily
      inspections provided ongoing staff education and enforcement of procedures.
      Monthly VAP rates were calculated and compared for trend. RESULTS: There were 475
      ICU admissions from May 2006 through August 2006 for a mean admission rate of 119
      per month. The rate of VAP per 1,000 ventilator days was 60.6 in May, 31.6 in
      June, 21.3 in July, and 11.1 in August (p = 0.029). Targeted surveillance in
      November and December revealed VAP rates of 11.6 and 9.7, respectively. Notably, 
      the most common bacteria, Acinetobacter, had improved antimicrobial
      susceptibilities after the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of
      aggressive infection control procedures in a combat military hospital was
      associated with a significant decrease in the rate of VAP. Despite the numerous
      challenges in theater, infection control can have measurable and sustainable
      impact in a combat theater hospital.

TI  - Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid induces protein kinase D-dependent disassembly of
      apical junctions and barrier dysfunction in airway epithelial cells.
PG  - 1216-1224.e11
LID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2011.08.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disruption of the epithelial barrier might be a risk factor for
      allergen sensitization and asthma. Viral respiratory tract infections are
      strongly associated with asthma exacerbation, but the effects of respiratory
      viruses on airway epithelial barrier function are not well understood. Many
      viruses generate double-stranded RNA, which can lead to airway inflammation and
      initiate an antiviral immune response. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of
      the synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) on
      the structure and function of the airway epithelial barrier in vitro. METHODS:
      16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cells and primary airway epithelial cells at
      an air-liquid interface were grown to confluence on Transwell inserts and exposed
      to polyI:C. We studied epithelial barrier function by measuring transepithelial
      electrical resistance and paracellular flux of fluorescent markers and structure 
      of epithelial apical junctions by means of immunofluorescence microscopy.
      RESULTS: PolyI:C induced a profound decrease in transepithelial electrical
      resistance and increase in paracellular permeability. Immunofluorescence
      microscopy revealed markedly reduced junctional localization of zonula
      occludens-1, occludin, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and disorganization of
      junction-associated actin filaments. PolyI:C induced protein kinase D (PKD)
      phosphorylation, and a PKD antagonist attenuated polyI:C-induced disassembly of
      apical junctions and barrier dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: PolyI:C has a powerful and
      previously unsuspected disruptive effect on the airway epithelial barrier.
      PolyI:C-dependent barrier disruption is mediated by disassembly of epithelial
      apical junctions, which is dependent on PKD signaling. These findings suggest a
      new mechanism potentially underlying the associations between viral respiratory
      tract infections, airway inflammation, and allergen sensitization.

TI  - Pilot-study on the influence of carrier gas and plasma application (open resp.
      delimited) modifications on physical plasma and its antimicrobial effect against 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - Doc02
LID - 10.3205/dgkh000186 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physical plasma is a promising new technology regarding its
      antimicrobial effects. This is especially accounting for treatment of bacterial
      infection of chronic wounds. Plasma can be generated with different carrier gases
      causing various biological effects. Screening of different carrier gases and
      plasma generation setups is therefore needed to find suitable compositions for
      highly effective antimicrobial plasma treatments and other applications. METHOD: 
      The plasma source used was a radio-frequency plasma jet which generates tissue
      tolerable plasma (TTP). The study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of air,
      argon, or helium plasma alone or admixed with 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% oxygen against
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).
      Treatment took place in an environmentally open and delimited system. Therefore, 
      bacteria were plated on agar and treated with plasma in a punctiform manner. The 
      resulting inhibition zones were measured and the reduction factors were
      calculated by colony counting, respectively. RESULTS: For S. aureus and P.
      aeruginosa, inhibition zones and overall reduction of colony forming units (CFU) 
      on the agar plate were observed while an accumulative reduction of CFU dominated 
      for S. aureus. The highest antimicrobial effect was shown in form of an
      inhibition zone for argon plasma with 0.1% oxygen admixture for both species. S. 
      aureus was more sensitive for helium plasma with >0.1% oxygen admixture compared 
      to P. aeruginosa which in turn was more sensitive for argon plasma with and
      without oxygen. The efficacy of air plasma was very low in comparison to the
      other gases. The treatment in a closed system predominantly enhanced the
      antimicrobial effect. The effect intensity varied for each treatment time and gas
      mixtures. DISCUSSION: As expected, the antimicrobial effect mostly increased when
      increasing oxygen admixture to the carrier gases. The variation in bacterial
      growth and inhibition after exposure to different plasma gas compositions could
      be due to a varying generation of reactive oxygen species or radiation.
      CONCLUSION: The applied plasma in a "closed system" accumulates bactericidal
      plasma species and might increase antimicrobial efficacy in clinical settings as 
      in wound management involving multi-drug resistant bacteria.

TI  - Spoilage potentials and antimicrobial resistance of Pseudomonas spp. isolated
      from cheeses.
PG  - 5851-6
LID - 10.3168/jds.2011-4676 [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas spp. are aerobic, gram-negative bacteria that are recognized as major
      food spoilage microorganisms. A total of 32 (22.9%) Pseudomonas spp. from 140
      homemade white cheese samples collected from the open-air public bazaar were
      isolated and characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      biochemical characteristics, the production of extracellular enzymes, slime and
      beta-lactamase, and antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas spp. isolated
      from cheeses. The identified isolates including Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes,
      Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens biovar
      V, and P. pseudoalcaligenes ssp. citrulli were found to produce extracellular
      enzymes, respectively: protease and lecithinase production (100%), and lipase
      activity (85.7, 42.9, 100, and 100%, and nonlipolytic, respectively). The
      isolates did not produce slime and had no detectable beta-lactamase activity. The
      antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was tested using the disk diffusion 
      method. Pseudomonas spp. had the highest resistance to penicillin G (100%), then 
      sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (28.1%). However, all Pseudomonas spp. isolates
      were 100% susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, and
      imipenem. Multidrug-resistance patterns were not observed among these isolates.
      In this study, Pseudomonas spp., exhibiting spoilage features, were isolated
      mainly from cheeses. Isolation of this organism from processed milk highlights
      the need to improve the hygienic practices. All of the stages in the milk
      processing chain during manufacturing have to be under control to achieve the
      quality and safety of dairy products.

TI  - Prevalence of cytomegalovirus infection in severe refractory ulcerative and
      Crohn's colitis.
PG  - 773-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cytomegalovirus infection has been reported as a cause of refractory 
      inflammatory bowel disease, but no data are available on its prevalence in severe
      colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and outcome of
      cytomegalovirus infection in a consecutive series of patients with severe steroid
      refractory colitis admitted to our department from 1997 to 1999. METHODS: Among
      62 patients with severe colitis, 55 with ulcerative colitis and seven with
      Crohn's disease, 19 (30%) were resistant to intravenous steroids and bowel rest. 
      In all of them, rectal biopsies were examined for cytomegalovirus (the flexible
      proctoscopy being performed without air insufflation and limited to the first 10 
      cm). Buffy coat preparation on leukocytes was also performed to detect systemic
      infection. If cytomegalovirus was not detected, cyclosporine was started.
      RESULTS: In seven (five with ulcerative colitis and two with Crohn's disease) out
      of 19 (36%) patients with refractory disease, cytomegalovirus was diagnosed in
      the rectal specimens as well as by buffy coat preparation. Five patients went
      into remission after antiviral treatment (three with ganciclovir and two with
      foscarnet). One patient did not respond and was operated on. In one patient,
      cytomegalovirus was found in the surgical specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Cytomegalovirus 
      infection is a frequent cause of severe refractory colitis. Rectal biopsy should 
      always be performed in severe steroid-resistant colitis.

TI  - Feasibility determination for use of polymerase chain reaction in the U.S. Air
      Force air-transportable hospital field environment: lessons learned.
PG  - 816-20
AB  - At present, the use of molecular probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
      the identification of microorganisms in body fluids or tissues is becoming more
      commonplace. There is an added advantage when serological or culture methods are 
      difficult, expensive, or unavailable. Slow-growing or fastidious microorganisms, 
      including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, spirochetes, viruses, and the dimorphic
      fungi, can be detected rapidly using these techniques. The presence of different 
      chromosomal or plasmid-mediated antibiotic-resistant markers can also be
      determined. PCR is an extremely powerful tool that has been applied to research, 
      and more recently it has been used to augment standard clinical applications. It 
      is a very simple process that can amplify nucleic acid sequences, both DNA and
      RNA, a million times over. The sensitivity, rapidity, broad applicability, and
      compactness of this technology make it an ideal candidate for use in the military
      arena. We recently established a molecular biology laboratory at a Deployable
      Medical System at the Camp Parks Army Reserve Training Facility in Dublin,
      California. This article will briefly summarize the use of PCR and its
      applicability in the air-transportable hospital field environment. Proper
      handling, processing, and testing as well as the requirements for setting up a
      molecular biology laboratory will be discussed. Finally, the benefits and
      disadvantages of using PCR-based techniques in the deployed field environment
      will be considered.

TI  - Environmental health effects of concentrated animal feeding operations:
      implications for nurses.
PG  - 311-9
LID - 10.1097/NAQ.0b013e3181f5649c [doi]
AB  - Changes in livestock farming over the last 50 years have led to the increase of
      large-scale livestock farms called concentrated animal feeding operations
      (CAFOs). These farms pose a threat to the environment by polluting the air and
      nearby ground and surface waters. In addition, adverse health effects have been
      found in CAFO workers and CAFO neighbors. A multitude of respiratory effects have
      been noted by workers and neighbors, some of which are severe enough to cause
      workers to leave the industry. The mental health of CAFO neighbors appears to
      suffer as well, mainly because of noxious odors and stress. Concentrated animal
      feeding operations also contribute to the growth of antibiotic-resistant
      bacteria, which have the potential to harm populations nationwide. Although
      research is being done on this topic around the world, the nursing literature
      contains very little information on health effects from CAFOs. Occupational,
      community, and public health nurses should be aware of the dangers from CAFOs and
      should participate in caring practices, research, and advocacy to diminish the
      risks.

TI  - Incidence and antibiotic susceptibility of genital mycoplasmas in sexually active
      individuals in Hungary.
PG  - 1423-6
LID - 10.1007/s10096-013-1892-y [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and antibiotic sensitivity of 
      Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis strains cultured from the genital
      discharges of sexually active individuals who attended our STD outpatient
      service. Samples were taken with universal swab (Biolab(R), Budapest, Hungary)
      into the Urea-Myco DUO kit (Bio-Rad(R), Budapest, Hungary) and incubated in
      ambient air for 48 h at 37 degrees C. The determination of antibiotic sensitivity
      was performed in U9 and arginin broth using the SIR Mycoplasma kit (Bio-Rad(R),
      Budapest, Hungary) under the same conditions. Between 01.05.2008 and 31.12.2011, 
      373/4,466 (8.35 %) genito-urethral samples with U. urealyticum and 41/4,466 (0.91
      %) genito-urethral samples with M. hominis infection were diagnosed in sexually
      active individuals in the National STD Center, Semmelweis University. U.
      urealyticum was isolated in 12.54 % in the cervix and 4.1 % in the male urethra, 
      while M. hominis was isolated in 1.33 % in the cervix and 0.51 % in the male
      urethra. The affected age group was between 21 and 60 years old. U. urealyticum
      strains were sensitive to tetracycline (95.9 %), doxycycline (97.32 %), and
      azithromycin (85.79 %), and resistant to erythromycin (81.23 %), clindamycin
      (75.06 %), and ofloxacin (25.2 %). Cross-resistance occurred in 38.71 % of
      patients to erythromycin and clindamycin. M. hominis strains were sensitive to
      clindamycin, ofloxacin, and doxycycline in more than 95 %, to tetracycline in
      82.92 %, and no cross-resistance was detected among the antibiotics. Our study
      confirms that the continuously changing antibiotic resistance of ureaplasmas and 
      mycoplasmas should be followed at least in a few centers in every country, so as 
      to determine the best local therapy options for sexually transmitted infection
      (STI) patients.

TI  - Systemic insecticides (neonicotinoids and fipronil): trends, uses, mode of action
      and metabolites.
PG  - 5-34
LID - 10.1007/s11356-014-3470-y [doi]
AB  - Since their discovery in the late 1980s, neonicotinoid pesticides have become the
      most widely used class of insecticides worldwide, with large-scale applications
      ranging from plant protection (crops, vegetables, fruits), veterinary products,
      and biocides to invertebrate pest control in fish farming. In this review, we
      address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of
      similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the
      environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one 
      third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the
      archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000 tonnes
      active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of
      neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in
      target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their
      physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of 
      insecticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3)
      they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic 
      nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of
      the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects.
      The toxicity persists for a variable period of time-depending on the plant, its
      growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications
      are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural
      Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use
      and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all
      environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and
      fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system 
      of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while
      fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate
      neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all
      insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target
      organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of
      synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review
      extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both
      compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may
      result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode
      of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate,
      coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds
      and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks
      to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of
      their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this 
      review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of
      evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious
      risks of undesirable environmental impacts.

TI  - Computed tomographic study of the common cold.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colds are common, but the abnormalities they produce in the nasal
      passages and sinus cavities have not been well defined. METHODS: We studied
      healthy adult volunteers with self-diagnosed colds of 48 to 96 hours' duration
      and obtained the following data: information on symptoms, computed tomographic
      (CT) studies of the nasal passages and sinuses, mucosal-transport times, measures
      of nasal-airway resistance, and viral-culture studies. Thirty-one subjects (mean 
      age, 24 years) had complete evaluations, including CT scans, which were read
      without knowledge of the clinical data. An additional 79 subjects underwent the
      same evaluations, except the CT scans. RESULTS: Of the 31 subjects with CT scans,
      24 (77 percent) had occlusion of the ethmoid infundibulum; 27 (87 percent) had
      abnormalities of one or both maxillary-sinus cavities; 20 (65 percent) had
      abnormalities of the ethmoid sinuses; 10 (32 percent) had abnormalities of the
      frontal sinuses; and 12 (39 percent) had abnormalities of the sphenoid sinuses.
      Infraorbital air cells were present in 14 subjects (45 percent), and
      pneumatization of the middle turbinate (concha bullosa) was noted in 11 subjects 
      (35 percent). Also common were engorged turbinates (in 7 subjects) and thickening
      of the walls of the nasal passages (in 13). After two weeks, the CT studies were 
      repeated in 14 subjects, none of whom received antibiotics. In 11 of these
      subjects (79 percent) the abnormalities of the infundibula and sinuses had
      cleared or markedly improved. Nasal-airway resistance was abnormal in 29 (94
      percent) and mucosal transport in 19 (61 percent) of the 31 subjects who had CT
      scans. Rhinovirus was detected in nasal secretions from 24 (27 percent) of 90
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The common cold is associated with frequent and variable
      anatomical involvement of the upper airways, including occlusion and
      abnormalities in the sinus cavities.

TI  - Polyelectrolyte multilayers with intrinsic antimicrobial functionality: the
      importance of mobile polycations.
PG  - 7686-94
LID - 10.1021/la900349c [doi]
AB  - Cationic contact-killing is an important strategy for creating antimicrobial
      surfaces that prevent viable bacteria attachment. Recent studies have shown that 
      highly swollen, compliant surfaces resist bacterial attachment and a sufficient
      density of mobile cationic charge can effectively disrupt bacterial cell
      membranes. Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs), a popular coating system for
      surface modification, have been used to kill bacteria through the incorporation
      of contact-killing or leaching biocides. In this work, we show that manipulation 
      of multilayer assembly and postassembly conditions (e.g., pH) to expose mobile
      cationic charge can create antimicrobial PEMs without the addition of specific
      biocidal species. As a model system, we explored PEMs comprising poly(allylamine 
      hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (SPS) assembled at high
      pH and subsequently immersed in low pH solutions. This system undergoes a
      reversible pH-dependent swelling transition, and we demonstrate that
      antimicrobial functionality at physiological pH conditions can be turned on and
      off with suitable pH treatment. In both airborne and waterborne bacteria assays, 
      the viability of two strains of Gram positive Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.
      epidermidis), one biofilm forming and one nonbiofilm forming, and two strains of 
      Gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) was effectively reduced on SPS/PAH
      multilayers displaying accessible cationic charge. To generalize our results, the
      pH assembly conditions of PEMs comprising poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and PAH were
      also modified to introduce antibacterial capabilities.

TI  - Prophylaxis of bacterial infections after bone marrow transplantation. A
      randomized prospective study comparing oral broad-spectrum nonabsorbable
      antibiotics (vancomycin-tobramycin-colistin) to absorbable antibiotics
      (ofloxacin-amoxicillin).
PG  - 33-8
AB  - Bacterial infection is a common complication after allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation. It is related to the toxic effects of the conditioning regimen
      on mucosal surfaces, to bone marrow aplasia and to the prolonged lymphopenia with
      immune deficiency that lasts for several weeks after bone marrow transplantation.
      We have performed a prospective randomized study comparing two methods of
      prophylaxis. Group I (OA) received a combination of ofloxacin 400 mg/day and
      amoxicillin 20 g/day; group II (VTC) received the oral nonabsorbable antibiotics 
      vancomycin 450 mg/day, tobramycin 450 mg/day and colistin 4.5.10(6) units daily, 
      from day -15 to 15 days after discharge from laminar air flow (LAF) rooms. All
      patients were nursed in LAF rooms with a strict isolation procedure and sterile
      water and food. They were evaluated daily for clinical symptoms, and bacterial
      culture samples were taken from the throat, stools and blood twice weekly.
      Forty-four patients were randomized, 22 entered in group I (OA) and 22 in group
      II (VTC). There were no differences between the two groups in age (mean 33 years,
      range 11-54), sex, diagnosis and mean duration of agranulocytosis (21.8 days,
      range 10-49). Seven patients were excluded because of the selection of a
      resistant bacteria, 5 were in group I (OA), and 2 were in group II (VTC). The
      mean duration of fever was 9.2 +/- 7.1 days in group I (OA) and 13.7 +/- 6.8 days
      in group II (VTC; p = 0.05). There were no significant differences between the
      two groups in graft-versus-host disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock: current evidence for emergency
      department management.
PG  - 1-22; quiz 22-3
AB  - In the middle of a busy shift, a patient arrives by ambulance from a local
      long-term care facility with a report of altered mental status. You enter the
      room to find a chronically ill-appearing 85-year-old man with fever, tachycardia,
      and hypotension, and it is instantly apparent that this patient is septic. What
      is not clear is what the source is, what modifications in treatment might be
      necessary based on preexisting microbial resistance, and which of the array of
      invasive resuscitation techniques are appropriate when meaningful recovery is
      questionable and efforts may not be desired by the patient and family. You order 
      IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics; send lab tests, including lactate and
      cultures of blood, urine, and sputum; and begin to review his extensive history
      to discuss goals of care with his family and primary doctor. While reviewing
      these issues, a 54-year-old woman with a history of asthma is brought straight
      back from triage with respiratory distress. You listen to her lungs, expecting
      wheezes, but hear decreased lung sounds at the right base, preserved air movement
      elsewhere, and her skin radiates heat. Now, on the monitor, she has a heart rate 
      of 135 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, O2 saturation of 86%, and
      a temperature of 39.4 degrees C (103 degrees F). You again identify sepsis and
      instruct your team that you will be using your department's severe sepsis
      protocol. Equipment for monitoring and procedures is assembled, your staff
      provides preprinted order and monitoring flow sheets, and the ICU is alerted.
      Within an hour, the patient is intubated, has a central line placed, and has
      received IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and norepinephrine, and you are
      pleased to see a MAP of 67 mm Hg, a lactate decreasing from an initial value of
      7.0, CVP of 10, and ScvO2 of 78%.

TI  - Risk factors for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
PG  - 323-30
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance is primarily due to excessive and often
      unnecessary use of antibiotics in humans and animals. Risk factors for the spread
      of resistant bacteria in hospitals and the community can be summarised as
      over-crowding, lapses in hygiene or poor infection control practices. Increasing 
      antibiotic resistance in bacteria has been exacerbated by the slow pace in
      developing newer antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
      vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria 
      are spread primarily by direct or indirect person-to-person contact. Independent 
      risk factors for MRSA include the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, the presence
      of decubitus ulcers and prosthetic devices while those for VRE include prolonged 
      hospitalisation and treatment with glycopeptides or broad spectrum antibiotics.
      For the spread of resistant Gram-negative bacteria risk factors include urinary
      catheterisation, excessive use of antibiotics and contamination of humidifiers
      and nebulisers. The spread of penicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRP) and
      drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTb) is due to airborne
      transmission. Risk factors for the spread of PRP include overcrowding,
      tracheostomies and excessive use of penicillins for viral respiratory infections;
      for MDRTb they include poor compliance, convergence of immunosuppressed patients,
      delayed diagnosis or treatment, and poor or inadequate ventilation and isolation 
      facilities. Recent developments in the genomic mapping of many bacteria and
      advances in combinatorial chemistry promise to usher in a new era of antibiotic
      development. While this may result in our regaining some of the ground lost to
      resistant bacteria, there will still be a continuing need to minimise the spread 
      of antibiotic resistance through the rational use of antibiotic agents and
      stringent infection control practice.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of Cocos nucifera
      var. typica.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-13-107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Teas from the husk fiber of Cocos nucifera are used in the folk
      medicine to treat arthritis and other inflammatory processes. Some works show
      that some varieties have biological activities. However, one of the main variety 
      of the species, C. nucifera var. typica, known in Brazil as "gigante", was not
      studied yet. Thus, this study evaluates if this variety has the anti-inflammatory
      and antimicrobial activities already reported in other varieties. METHODS: C.
      nucifera aqueous crude extract (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg) and the reference drugs
      morphine (1 mg/kg) and acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/kg) were evaluated in models 
      of inflammation (formalin-induced licking and subcutaneous air pouch). The
      antioxidant activity was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate
      (DPPH) photometric assay and compared with those of the standards (quercetin,
      rutin, and ascorbic acid). The extract was also screened against Candida
      albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in the agar diffusion method. The minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 
      determined by the broth micro-dilution assay. Activities of combinations of the
      extract and antibiotics (methicillin or vancomycin) against MRSA were evaluated
      using checkerboard assays. RESULTS: The extract significantly inhibited the time 
      that the animals spent licking the formalin-injected paws (second phase). The
      extract also inhibited the inflammatory process induced by subcutaneous
      carrageenan injection by reducing cell migration, protein extravasation, and
      TNF-alpha production. Additionally, the extract showed an antioxidant potential
      in vitro as good as standards in their antioxidant activity. The extract was
      active only against S. aureus and MRSA. MIC and the bactericidal concentrations
      were identical (1,024 mug/ml). The extract and methicillin acted synergistically 
      against the clinical MRSA isolate, whereas an indifferent effect was detected
      when the extract was combined with vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: The extract exhibits 
      anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of the cell migration. The
      mixture of extract constituents and methicillin could lead to the development of 
      a new combination antibiotic against MRSA infections.

TI  - Syndrome of Rochalimaea henselae adenitis suggesting cat scratch disease.
PG  - 331-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a clinical syndrome of cat scratch disease caused by
      Rochalimaea henselae, including methods for isolation of the organism from tissue
      and for identification. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: U.S. Air Force referral
      hospital infectious diseases clinic. PATIENTS: Two previously healthy patients.
      MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two immunocompetent patients who had handled cats 
      developed unilateral upper-extremity adenitis associated with a distal papular
      lesion and fever. The adenitis and distal lesions persisted and progressively
      worsened. Cultures of the involved lymph nodes from both patients grew R.
      henselae, a recently described organism associated with bacillary angiomatosis
      and peliosis hepatis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and with
      bacteremia in immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. The organism was
      characterized as oxidase negative and X-factor dependent and had a characteristic
      pattern in analysis of whole-cell fatty acids differing from Afipia felis, a
      bacterium that has been associated with cat scratch disease. The identity of the 
      isolate was confirmed by analysis of whole-cell fatty acids using gas
      chromatography and by amplification of the citrate synthetase gene sequence and
      analysis of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product. The organisms were
      broadly susceptible to a variety of antimicrobials by broth microdilution;
      however in-vitro resistance to first-generation cephalosporins correlated with
      clinical failure of therapy. CONCLUSION: Rochalimaea henselae can be a cause of
      cat scratch disease in immunocompetent patients.

TI  - Bacterial colonization of patients undergoing international air transport: a
      prospective epidemiologic study.
PG  - 44-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of multiresistant bacteria in patients
      treated in foreign hospitals and repatriated by international interhospital air
      transport. METHODS: This was a prospective epidemiologic study on patients who
      were hospitalized in a foreign country and repatriated to a hospital in their
      home country by international aeromedical transport on scheduled airlines or
      ambulance jets. The study was carried out by the Department of Pediatrics,
      Department of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, and
      MedCall Germany, the organizing company for repatriation. One hundred and three
      patients, who were hospitalized abroad, required repatriation by international
      interhospital air transport and met the entry criteria. RESULTS: Four hundred and
      eighty-three swabs from brow, nose, ear, throat, groin or axilla were taken from 
      103 patients, mean age 62 years. They were transported from southern and eastern 
      European countries, Morocco, Egypt, Ghana, Tunisia, Pakistan, the United States
      and the Bahamas to destinations in Germany, the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, the
      United States and Japan. Forty-four patients were in an intensive care unit (ICU)
      for 6.5 days (median) prior to transport. Forty patients received antibiotics at 
      the time of repatriation. Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Proteus,
      Staphylococcus aureus and Candida were found. Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found in three patients (3%), ventilated for 17 
      days, and treated in the ICU for a median of 23 days. In 2 patients,
      multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization of patients undergoing
      international interhospital air transport does not differ from that of patients
      in a European hospital. Multiresistant bacteria, especially MRSA, were found only
      in ICU patients. There is no elevated risk of transmission of multiresistant
      bacteria in this patient group compared to other patients treated in hospital,
      especially in ICUs.

AB  - The spread of Gram-negative bacteria with plasmid-borne extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamases (ESBLs) has become a worldwide problem. Their prevalence is
      increasing, both in hospitals and in the environment. The aim of this study was
      to investigate the presence of ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae in municipal
      sewage and their emission to the ambient air and the river receiving effluent
      from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In the group of 455 isolated strains, up 
      to 19.8% (90 isolates) were phenotypic ESBL-producers. They were detected in the 
      63 (100%) of sewage samples analyzed, 7 (33.3%) of river water and in 10 (23.8%) 
      of air samples collected at the WWTP area. The plasmid-mediated genes encoding
      beta-lactams resistance were detected in almost 10% out of bacteria of the WWTP's
      final effluents and in above 32% out of bacteria of air at the WWTP area. It
      confirms that those genes are released into the environment, which might
      facilitate further dissemination among environmental bacteria. Moreover, genes
      encoding antibiotic resistance were shown to be transferrable to an Escherichia
      coli recipient strain, which indicates a high possibility of horizontal gene
      transfer among strains of different genera within the sewage and environmental
      samples. This study demonstrated that despite the treatment, the municipal sewage
      may be a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and plasmid-mediated
      antibiotic resistance genes. This may pose a public health risk, which requires
      future evaluation and control.

TI  - Airborne antibiotic concentrations in a swine feeding operation.
PG  - 357-66
AB  - During the past 50 years, it has become common practice in the U.S. to add
      antibiotics to livestock feed to reduce disease and promote growth. Use of
      antibiotics in this manner has become the source of increasing controversy
      because overuse of antibiotics is suspected of leading to resistance in bacteria 
      that cause human diseases. The purpose of this study was to measure airborne
      antibiotic concentrations in a swine production facility that routinely included 
      antibiotics in feed. Samples were collected in a hog facility that included rooms
      devoted to farrowing, nursery, and growing operations. Analytical methods were
      developed to measure concentrations of the antibiotics tylosin and lincomycin in 
      air samples. Tylosin was mixed in the feed in some of the rooms in the facility. 
      While lincomycin was not added during this study, it had been used in this
      facility in the past and therefore was included in the analytical testing.
      Inhalable (n = 34), respirable (n = 37), and high-volume (n = 16) dust samples
      were collected on PVC filters over a two-month period. Tylosin concentrations
      were above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in 93% of the samples, while
      lincomycin concentrations were above the LOQ in only 9% of the samples (LOQ =
      0.04 ng/sample). The average tylosin concentrations were 3, 18, and 49 ng/m3 in
      the respirable, inhalable, and high-volume samples, respectively. No occupational
      or environmental worker exposure criteria currently exist for antibiotics in air.
      The results of this study may be used to estimate potential swine production
      worker exposures and to further study the association between these exposures and
      health effects.

LID - 10.1007/s10453-017-9481-7 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus were isolated from air sampled from living
      spaces in Krakow (Poland). In total, 55 strains belonging to the genus
      Staphylococcus were isolated from 45 sites, and 13 species of coagulase-negative 
      staphylococci were identified. The species composition of studied airborne
      microbiota contains Staphylococcus species that are rarely infectious to humans. 
      Most commonly isolated species comprised S. hominis and S. warneri. The
      disk-diffusion tests showed that the collected isolates were most frequently
      resistant to erythromycin. The PCR technique was employed to search for genes
      conferring the resistance in staphylococci to antibiotics from the group of
      macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins. The analyzed Staphylococcus isolates
      possessed simultaneously 4 different resistance genes. The molecular analysis
      with the use of specific primers allowed to determine the most prevalent gene
      which is mphC, responsible for the resistance to macrolides and for the enzymatic
      inactivation of the drug by phosphotransferase. The second most often detected
      gene was msrA1, which confers the resistance of staphylococci to macrolides and
      is responsible for active pumping of antimicrobial particles out of bacterial
      cells.

      meat-contact surface materials.
PG  - M343-7

AB  - UNLABELLED: Studies examined the effects of meat-contact material types,
      inoculation substrate, presence of air at the liquid-solid surface interface
      during incubation, and incubation substrate on the attachment/transfer and
      subsequent biofilm formation by Escherichia coli O157:H7 on beef carcass
      fabrication surface materials. Materials studied as 2 x 5 cm coupons included
      stainless steel, acetal, polypropylene, and high-density polyethylene. A 6-strain
      rifampicin-resistant E. coli O157:H7 composite was used to inoculate (6 log
      CFU/mL, g, or cm(2)) tryptic soy broth (TSB), beef fat/lean tissue homogenate
      (FLH), conveyor belt-runoff fluids, ground beef, or beef fat. Coupons of each
      material were submerged (4 degrees C, 30 min) in the inoculated fluids or ground 
      beef, or placed between 2 pieces of inoculated beef fat with pressure (20 kg)
      applied. Attachment/transfer of the pathogen was surface material and substrate
      dependent, although beef fat appeared to negate differences among surface
      materials. Beef fat was the most effective (P < 0.05) inoculation substrate,
      followed by ground beef, FLH, and TSB. Incubation (15 degrees C, 16 d) of beef
      fat-inoculated coupons in a beef fat homogenate (pH 4.21) allowed the pathogen to
      survive and grow on coupon surfaces, with maximal biofilm formation observed
      between 2 and 8 d of storage and when air was present at the liquid-solid
      interface. The results indicated that the process of fabricating beef carcasses
      may be conducive to the attachment of E. coli O157:H7 onto meat-contact surfaces 
      and subsequent biofilm formation. Furthermore, it is recommended that substrates 
      found in beef fabrication settings, rather than laboratory culture media, be used
      in studies designed to investigate E. coli O157:H7 biofilm development and
      control in these environments. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Findings of this study
      provide knowledge on the effect of type of beef carcass fabrication surface
      material, fabrication-floor fluids and residues, and incubation conditions on
      attachment/transfer and subsequent biofilm formation by E. coli O157:H7. The
      results highlight the importance of thoroughly cleaning soiled surfaces to remove
      all remnants of beef fat or other organic material that may harbor or protect
      microbial contaminants during otherwise lethal antimicrobial interventions.

TI  - [Controversial points in the treatment of patients with haematologic malignancies
      complicated with systemic fungal infections].
PG  - 143-9
AB  - Prophylaxis and treatments for fungal infections differ with the infection type. 
      However, the eradication of risk factors for outbreak of fungal infections, and
      the usage of appropriate antifungal agents are universally important to prevent
      these infections. For infections due to intrinsic fungi such as Candida spp.,
      risk factors such as changes in normal flora by aggressive and prolonged
      broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy should not be permitted to emerge. On the
      other hand, infections due to extrinsic fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans and
      Aspergillus spp. can be prevented by eradication of the colonized fungi using
      antifungal prophylaxis and the use of air-cleaning machines to combat
      colonization of patients and contamination in the hospital environment. The most 
      important risk factor of fungal infections in patients suffering from
      haematologic malignancies is leukopenia. In these cases, it is crucial to reduce 
      the duration of neutropenia and enhance the anti-microbial function using
      granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor. When a patient is complicated
      with a fungal infection, appropriate antifungal agents must be used at
      appropriate dosages for the appropriate period. However, there are still very few
      satisfactory antifungals with minimal adverse effects and good potential efficacy
      for systemic fungal infections. Therefore, combination therapy with amphotericin 
      B and azole antifungals is necessary for patients with severe fungal infections. 
      In patients complicated with fungal infections, the underlying disease is often
      resistant to aggressive antifungal therapy. Control of this underlying disease is
      thus a most important therapeutic factor.

TI  - [Nocardia infections: clinical and biological aspects].
PG  - 545-54
AB  - The nocardiosis is an infection caused by a bacterial pathogen agent, Nocardia,
      belonging to the Actinomycetales order. They are Gram-positive, strictly aerobic 
      bacteria. Members of the genus Nocardia are ubiquitous. They are frequently
      isolated from soil, water, air dusts. The mode of contamination occurs by
      inhalation or by cutaneous or ocular traumatic lesion. Clinically, nocardiosis is
      essentially characterized by pulmonary diseases. Others secondary localizations
      are described, such as in the central nervous system. Nocardia can be responsible
      for important cutaneous, subcutaneous and lymphocutaneous manifestations. In the 
      same way, some extrapulmonary diseases and spread nocardiosis are more rarely
      observed. Several factors seem to favour the development of Nocardia. The
      immunocompromised patients, particularly those with organ transplant and the
      patients treated with immunosuppressor treatments, offer strong predispositions
      to this opportunistic disease. The nocardiosis is nevertheless observed in
      healthy persons. In front of polymorphic and specific-less clinical
      manifestations, large phenotypic heterogeneity, and resistance profiles to
      specific antibiotics, a correct diagnosis for Nocardia species is necessary to
      apply an adequate treatment. The techniques of identification based on the
      chemotaxonomic analysis and the susceptibility to different inhibitors are
      efficient for the identification of genus and species. However, because of the
      slow growth rate of Nocardia, the reading of these tests can require several
      weeks of incubation. With the intention of the rapid identification of genus and 
      species, the molecular techniques (PCR-RFLP) seem to be efficient. The technique 
      of RAPD allows an efficient molecular typing, which will give a better knowledge 
      concerning transmission, ecological niches and epidemic reservoirs.

TI  - Evaluation of a cefoxitin 30 microg disc on Iso-Sensitest agar for detection of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 204-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a cefoxitin 30 microg disc on
      Iso-Sensitest agar, using a semi-confluent inoculum and overnight incubation at
      35-36 degrees C, for detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA). METHODS: A total of 457 S. aureus, including 190 MRSA of several defined 
      PFGE types and a number of low-level resistant isolates, were tested with a
      cefoxitin 30 microg disc on Iso-Sensitest agar, using a semi-confluent inoculum
      and overnight incubation at 35-36 degrees C. This method was compared with the
      standard SRGA (Swedish Reference Group for Antibiotics) method (oxacillin 1
      microg disc on Iso-Sensitest agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood, 
      confluent growth and 24 h incubation in ambient air at 30 degrees C). RESULTS:
      The cefoxitin method was excellent, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity 
      of 99% using an interpretative zone diameter of S > or = 29 mm and R < 29 mm. Its
      performance was much better than the SRGA method, which with this collection of
      difficult strains had a sensitivity of only 78% using the current breakpoint of S
      > or = 12 mm. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the cefoxitin method should replace
      that currently recommended by the SRGA for the detection of MRSA, and that it
      would fit well into BSAC methodology.

PG  - 77-82
AB  - To separate the respective effects of sterile air and antibiotic prophylaxis in
      orthopedic surgery, the authors reviewed 2,384 cementless total hip replacements 
      performed from 1975 to 1984 for incidence of deep sepsis. During this period, a
      conventionally ventilated room (100 particle-forming units (pfu)/m3) and a
      laminar vertical flow (1 pfu/m3) were alternately used, without significant
      difference in the sepsis rate. Beginning in 1979, a prophylactic antibiotic
      regimen was added, which from 1979 to 1984 reduced the incidence of deep sepsis
      from 2.78% to 0.52%. There was also a change in common infecting organisms, from 
      sensitive to resistant strains, which is not an insignificant consequence.

TI  - Clinical aromatherapy and AIDS.
PG  - 81-99
AB  - Clinical aromatherapy is the use of essential oils for expected outcomes that are
      measurable and is a therapy that is used as part of nursing care in Switzerland, 
      Germany, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and, more recently, the United
      States. Essential oils are steam distillates obtained from aromatic plants. These
      volatile extracts have been used for many years by French hospitals against
      airborne bacteria and fungi. As antimicrobial agents, essential oils may be
      appropriate in HIV/AIDS for specific opportunistic infections. Aromatherapy can
      also alter perceptions of chronic pain, help maintain skin integrity, and is
      useful in stress management. Methods of application vary depending on the site of
      infection and the psychological profile of the patient and can include
      inhalation, compresses, baths, massage, and the "m" technique. This article will 
      explore the potential use of essential oils in HIV/AIDS focusing on four
      opportunistic infections: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and herpes simplex types I and II.

TI  - [The clinical and pathogenic characteristics of keratitis caused by Alternaria
      alternata].
PG  - 32-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and pathogenic characteristics of keratitis
      caused by Alternaria alternata and to provide evidence for the diagnose and
      treatment of mycotic keratitis. METHODS: The patients with keratitis were
      examined by lamp microscope; the direct smears of corneal scrapings were stained 
      using 10% potassium hydroxide and Giemsa's staining and the results were observed
      under microscope. After hypha was found, the samples from corneal were taken for 
      fungal culture and fungal susceptibility test in vitro according to the National 
      Community of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS) document M38-A at the same
      time. Ketoconazole, Amphotericin B and Fluconazole eye drops were applied into
      eyes frequently and alternately. The affectivity of the treatment were also
      observed. The isolates of Alternaria alternata from patients were used to induce 
      keratitis in rabbits. The rabbits were sacrificed by air after 5 days and 14 days
      and their corneas were taken for pathology and inoculating for fungi. RESULTS:
      All the patients have only one eye with Alternaria alternata's keratitis and
      their average age was 50 years old. The lesions of corneal necrosis in the
      patients and Alternaria alternata's keratitis in the rabbits were appeared as
      light grey, shallow and a diffused edge. Alternaria alternata showed as thick
      transparent hypha and a great of spherical chlamydospores on the top of hypha or 
      cluster one and the other in corneal scraping under microscope. The hypha and
      spores of Alternaria alternata in the culture medium were all brown and the
      spores were separated into cells like wall brick and grew on the top of spores
      linking like chains. Anti-microbial susceptibility testing in vitro showed that
      Alternaria alternata was susceptible to Voriconazole, Amphotericin B,
      Ketoconazole, Miconazole, Econazole, Terbinafine and Fluconazole but it was
      resistant to Clotrimazole, Flucytosine ang Itraconazole. 22 of the patients were 
      cured by dropping Amphotericin B, Ketoconazole and Fluconazole frequently and
      alternately but surgery was performed in one case. The mean cured time was 34
      day. The lesion of rabbits keratitis caused by Alternaria alternata was thin and 
      localized only in the region of lacking epicytes. The isolate from the rabbit's
      keratitis model was Alternaria alternata. CONCLUSIONS: The keratitis caused by
      Alternaria alternata has its distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics.
      The virulence of Alternaria alternata is relatively low to cornea and the
      combination of anti-fungal agents could cure Alternaria alternata keratitis.

TI  - Analysis of cell wall constituents of biocide-resistant isolates from dental-unit
      water line biofilms.
PG  - 340-7
LID - 10.1007/s00284-008-9200-2 [doi]
AB  - In past years, the significance of microbial resistance to biocides has
      increased. Twenty biocide-resistant bacterial strains were isolated from
      dental-unit water line biofilm. All strains resisted high biocide concentrations 
      (up to 100 microg ml(-1)): sodium dodecyl sulphate, hydrogen peroxide, sodium
      hypochlorite, phenol, Tween 20, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, chlorohexidine
      gluconate, and povidine iodine. Among bacteria, biocide sensitivity is based on
      permeability of biocides through the cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria are more
      permeable and susceptible to biocides, whereas gram-negative bacteria have a more
      complex cell wall and are the least sensitive bacteria. The present study was
      designed to study the effect of biocides on the cell wall of biocide-resistant
      bacteria. Peptidoglycan (PG), diaminopimelic acid (DAP), and teichoic acid
      contents of the cell wall were determined in L-broth and L-broth supplemented
      with biocides at different temperatures (37 degrees C and 45 degrees C) and pH
      levels (7 and 9). In general and Gram staining-specific comparison, a significant
      increase (p < 0.05) in the DAP content of biocide-resistant bacteria was observed
      at pH 7 and at both temperatures. In tubing-specific comparison, a significant
      increase in the amount of teichoic acid in air water tubing (37 degrees C at pH
      9) and DAP in patient tubing (pH 7 at both temperatures) was observed. In main
      water pipe, a significant decrease (p > 0.05) in PG content was noticed at 45
      degrees C and pH 9. Overall, a significant increase in DAP content may be an
      important constituent in the manifestation of isolate resistance against various 
      biocides.

TI  - Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: an emerging respiratory tract pathogen.
PG  - 877-80
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the Viridans 
      Streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease and respiratory tract infections (RTI). Very scanty information is
      available on the isolation of S. pseudopneumoniae from India. Hence, the present 
      study was an attempt to isolate S. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to 
      study their drug resistance pattern. METHODS: Sputum samples (n=150) submitted to
      the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically
      suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep
      blood agar and chocolate agar plates. Alpha haemolytic colonies were identified
      as S. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin 
      susceptibility in 5 per cent CO(2) and ambient air. Disk diffusion method was
      used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. RESULTS: Among the samples screened, 
      4 per cent showed the growth of only S. pseudopneumoniae. Other pathogens
      isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp.,
      Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus
      aureus, Candida albicans. All the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to 
      erythromycin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed
      presence of S. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were
      associated with RTI. Currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin
      susceptible isolates in 5 per cent CO(2) as S. pneumoniae and the resistant ones 
      are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. As a result, S.
      pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. Hence, performance of at least two tests,
      viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent CO(2) and ambient air 
      along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S.
      pseudopneumoniae.

PG  - 4770-7
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.06.038 [doi]
AB  - Poultry are known to harbor antibiotic resistant and pathogenic bacteria, and as 
      such poultry litter and poultry house air can be contaminated with these
      bacteria. However, the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in biological
      aerosols and litter is largely not understood. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the amount of aerosolized bacteria and endotoxin, particularly fecal
      indicators, staphylococci, and enterococci, associated with poultry house and
      outdoor air. Aerosol samples were collected at multiple locations on the farm and
      in the house. Antibiotic resistance was investigated using the Kirby Bauer method
      on selected isolates using twelve different antibiotics spanning both narrow to
      broad spectrums of effectiveness. Overall there was a cyclical increase in
      bacterial concentrations as flocks progressed from pre-flock to late-flock, with 
      >2 orders magnitude lower concentration during pre-flock periods (no chickens),
      in both the litter and aerosol samples. The house environment provided for
      significantly concentrated bacterial and endotoxin levels. It was estimated that 
      Staphylococcus bacteria accounted for at least 90% of cultured aerobic bacteria
      and culture-independent 16S rRNA analyses demonstrated that significant
      population changes occurred from pre- to late-flock. Rarely was an isolate
      resistant to more than 4 antibiotic classes; however there was a trend upwards in
      overall resistance of enterococci as the flock cycle progressed. It appears that 
      although levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria were highly concentrated within 
      the house, levels were much lower outside of the house, and very little house
      escape occurred.

TI  - Pathophysiology of cardiopulmonary bypass: current issues.
PG  - 177-89
AB  - Much of the research related to cardiopulmonary bypass in recent years has been
      directed toward defining the changes in plasma and blood cells during bypass. In 
      this review, recent information is reexamined for six areas of current interest. 
      These areas are complement activation, immune response, anaphylactic reactions,
      coagulation, and cerebral dysfunction. Complement may be activated by either the 
      classical or alternate pathway during cardiopulmonary bypass and protamine
      administration. Membrane oxygenators appear to diminish the degree of complement 
      activation. Complement is a major factor in the whole body inflammatory response;
      which often accompanies cardiopulmonary bypass. A product of complement
      activation, C5a- desArg, causes activation and aggregation of granulocytes. Other
      products of complement activation lead to lysis of blood cells including
      granulocytes and red cells. Bubble oxygenators appear to have a distinct
      disadvantage compared to membrane oxygenators regarding infection. Airborne
      microorganisms are more likely to be entrained into circulating blood with bubble
      oxygenators than with membrane oxygenators. Bubble oxygenators cause a greater
      decrease in leukocyte number and function than membrane oxygenators. Anaphylactic
      reactions have been associated with use of antibiotics, blood products,
      protamine, and volume expanders during cardiopulmonary bypass. Protamine
      reactions may be on an immunological basis or due to direct toxicity of the drug.
      Free radicals including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical
      may be generated during cardiopulmonary bypass and reperfusion. Free radical
      scavengers including; vitamin E, coenzyme Q, vitamin C, mannitol, and glutathione
      have been studied. The avoidance of blood transfusion because of risk of
      transmitted infection including AIDS has become a major goal in cardiac surgery. 
      Factors that correlate with increased transfusion requirement include low
      hematocrit, female gender, increased age, small body size, low ejection fraction,
      reoperation, and emergency operation. Heparin resistance due to antithrombin III 
      deficiency is being recognized more commonly. Antithrombin III deficiency may be 
      corrected with fresh frozen plasma. Patients with heparin induced
      thrombocytopenia may be difficult to manage. Several management protocols are
      suggested. The most straightforward appears to be the use of aspirin
      preoperatively and platelet transfusions postoperatively. The incidence of
      cerebral dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass depends on the sensitivity of
      the test or indicator used. Perioperative stroke is associated with intrinsic
      cerebrovascular disease and atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta. Retinal
      angiograms during cardiopulmonary bypass show that microemboli are very common.
      Cerebroplegia has been shown to extend the period of safe circulatory arrest in
      animals. Much of the new knowledge concerning cardiopulmonary bypass is the
      result of close collaboration between cardiac surgeons and nonsurgical
      scientists.

TI  - Frequency of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, pigmentation, and plasmids in
      bacteria of the marine air-water interface.
PG  - 2338-42
AB  - A field investigation of marine coastal waters revealed that the frequency of
      pigmented bacteria and the occurrence of bacterial antibiotic resistance were
      higher at the air-water interface than in the bulk water. The differences in the 
      frequency of pigmented colonies at the surface and in the bulk-water samples
      could not be explained by the degree of cell surface hydrophobicity or by
      bacterial adhesion to air-water interfaces. Pigmented strains exhibited a higher 
      degree of multiple drug resistance than did nonpigmented strains. However, the
      frequency of multiple drug resistance in nonpigmented strains was also
      substantial. An average of 91% of all strains were resistant to more than one
      antibiotic, and 21% of the bacteria isolated were resistant to five of the eight 
      antibiotics tested. High numbers of plasmid-carrying strains were found among
      selected surface isolates, but the presence of detectable plasmids could not be
      correlated with either pigmentation or multiple drug resistance. Furthermore,
      selected surface isolates were significantly more resistant to mercury than were 
      bulk-water bacteria. The higher frequency of pigmented, antibiotic-resistant, and
      mercury resistant strains at the air-water interface than in the bulk water are
      discussed in terms of various forms of selective pressure and genetic exchange at
      the surface.

TI  - Studies on the production and purification of an antimicrobial compound and
      taxonomy of the producer isolated from the marine environment of the Sundarbans.
PG  - 497-505
AB  - A microorganism isolated from the Sundarbans region of the Bay of Bengal, India, 
      showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative
      bacteria, molds, yeast and several multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria,
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The isolate grew in
      the presence of 20% (w/v) NaCl, antibiotic production being maximum with 5% (w/v)
      NaCl in the production medium. Natural seawater stimulated antibiotic
      biosynthesis. The absence of catabolite repression during the synthesis of the
      antimicrobial substance was demonstrated by the utilization of glucose by this
      isolate. The 16S rRNA gene of this aerobic, gram-positive, mycelium- and
      spore-forming microorganism was amplified, and molecular phylogenetic analysis of
      the DNA sequence showed less than 93% similarity with its closest relative,
      indicating differentiation at the genus level. The highly stable, active
      principle was purified by butyl acetate extraction and silica-gel chromatography 
      and a single compound was found to posses the broad-spectrum activity. Molecular 
      characterization showed that the active compound is a lipid. Bioreactor studies
      demonstrated that antibiotic production is strongly dependent on the scale of
      operation and there is a definite relation between the dissolved oxygen
      concentration, medium pH, glucose utilization, cell differentiation and
      antibiotic production. Maximum production in 30 h could be obtained by regulation
      of the medium pH in the alkaline range by a combination of controlled addition of
      NaOH, regulation of the air supply and changes in the reactor configuration.
      Considering all of the above evidences and based on comparison with the current
      literature, a novel antimicrobial appears to have been isolated.

PG  - 83-90
LID - 10.1111/lam.12091 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) affect 5-10% of acute
      hospital admissions. Environmental decontamination is an important component of
      all strategies to prevent HCAI as many bacterial causes survive and persist in
      the environment, which serve as ongoing reservoirs of infection. Current
      approaches such as cleaning with detergents and the use of chemical disinfectant 
      are suboptimal. We assessed the efficacy of helium and helium-air plasma in
      killing Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile on a glass surface and
      studied the impact on bacterial cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both
      plasma types exhibited bactericidal effects on Staph. aureus (log3.6 - >log7),
      with increased activity against methicillin-resistant strains, but had a
      negligible effect on Cl. difficile spores (<1log). AFM demonstrated cell surface 
      disruption. The addition of air increased the microbicidal activity of the plasma
      and decreased the exposure time required for an equivalent log reduction. Further
      evaluation of cold plasma systems is warranted with, for example, different
      bacteria and on surfaces more reminiscent of the health care environment as this 
      approach has potential as an effective decontaminant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF 
      THE STUDY: Many bacterial causes of healthcare infection can survive in the
      inanimate environment for lengthy periods and be transmitted to patients.
      Furthermore, current methods of environmental decontamination such as detergents,
      chemical disinfectants or gaseous fumigation are suboptimal for a variety of
      reasons. We assessed the efficacy of helium and helium-air plasma as a
      decontaminant and demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial counts of
      Staphylococcus aureus on a glass surface. Atomic force microscopy morphologically
      confirmed the impact on bacterial cells. This approach warrants further study as 
      an alternative to current options for hospital hygiene.

TI  - Changing patterns of bacterial nosocomial infections: a nine-year study in a

PG  - 69-76
AB  - Surveillance data on 12,944 bacterial isolates derived from nosocomial
      infections, reported to the Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of
      the Hellenic Air Force and VA General Hospital over a 9-year period (1986-1994), 
      were analyzed by the use of a microbial infection control software system.
      Overall, the isolation rate of Escherichia coli decreased from 25.2% in 1986 to
      18.2% in 1994 and Proteus spp. from 5.3 to 2.6%. Remarkably, Pseudomonas spp.
      increased from 7.2 to 11.3%, Enterobacter spp. from 1.6 to 5.1%, Klebsiella spp. 
      from 5.9 to 7.8% and Enterococcus spp. from 3 to 7.4%. Interestingly, the above
      phenomenon was paralleled by a significant increase in resistance rate to various
      antibiotics. Specifically, Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative
      staphylococci, though they did not display any significant variation in isolation
      rates, showed an alarming increase in resistance rate to oxacillin, from 11 and
      21% in 1986 to 51 and 75% in 1994, respectively. Enterococcus spp. sensitivity to
      vancomycin remained unlatered at 90%. The above-mentioned serious shift towards
      more resistant bacteria should be a matter of consideration.

      mummies at the Mexico City Museum "El Carmen"].
PG  - 283-8
AB  - We present a study on the control and elimination of the fungi affecting the
      mummies specifically at the museum "El Carmen", in San Angel, Mexico City. Twelve
      analysed mummies presented an important deterioration attributed to colonizing
      fungi. The degree of fungal contamination and the efficacy of imazalil were
      evaluated. Two samplings were performed in order to isolate and identify the
      fungal genera, one for control and the other after the treatment. Isolation was
      done by the carpet-square technique and identification was performed by
      morphological features. Each sampling gave a total of 100 samples as follows: 17 
      from the air, 23 from the walls and 60 from the mummies. Samples were cultured on
      Sabouraud dextrose agar. From the first sampling a total of 649 colonies
      corresponding to 24 genera were obtained being the most frequent Penicillium,
      Cladophialophora and Aspergillus. From the second sampling, after the imazalil
      treatment, which was applied by means of lit candles containing the antifungal
      drug, 57 colonies were recovered, representing a 91.2% fungal reduction; 18
      genera were eliminated. In spite of resistance showed by many Penicillium
      strains, the imazalil is an alternative drug for the control of fungal
      colonization on these studied materials.

TI  - Prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization and its risk factors 
      in chronic hemodialysis patients in Shiraz, Iran.
PG  - 52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE) are increasing in prevalence at
      many institutions, and are often reported in dialysis patients. The aim of this
      cross-sectional prevalence study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors
      of VRE colonization in chronic hemodialysis patients in two hemodialysis centers 
      in Shiraz, Iran. METHODS: Rectal swabs were obtained from all consenting patients
      and were streaked on the surface of Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA) and
      incubated at 37 degrees C in air for 24 h. The vancomycin susceptibility of each 
      isolate was confirmed by disk susceptibility testing. The MICs of vancomycin and 
      teicoplanin were confirmed by the E test. To identify risk factors, a
      questionnaire was completed for all the studied patients and the data of VRE
      positive and negative groups were compared using Man-Withney U test for continues
      data and the Fisher exact test for categorical data. RESULTS: Of 146 patients
      investigated, 9 (6.2%) were positive for VRE. All VRE strains were genotypically 
      distinguishable. Risk factors for a VRE-positive culture were "antimicrobial
      receipt within 2 months before culture" (P = 0.003) and "hospitalization during
      previous year" (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: VRE colonization is an under-recognized
      problem among chronic dialysis patients in Iran. VRE colonization is associated
      with antibiotic consumption and hospitalization.

TI  - Characterization of antibacterial silver coated yarns.
PG  - 2361-6
LID - 10.1007/s10856-009-3796-z [doi]
AB  - Surface treatments of textile fibers and fabrics significantly increase their
      performances for specific biomedical applications. Nowadays, silver is the most
      used antibacterial agent with a number of advantages. Among them, it is worth to 
      note the high degree of biocompatibility, an excellent resistance to
      sterilization conditions, antibacterial properties with respect to different
      bacteria associated with a long-term of antibacterial efficiency. However, there 
      are only a few antibacterial fibres available, mainly synthetic with high
      production cost and limited effectiveness. Cotton yarns with antimicrobial
      properties are most suitable for wound healing applications and other medical
      treatments thanks to their excellent moisture absorbance while synthetic based
      fibres are most suitable for industrial applications such as automotive tapestry 
      and air filters. The silver-coated fibers were developed applying an innovative
      and low cost silver deposition technique for natural and synthetic fibers or
      yarns. The structure and morphology of the silver nanoclusters on the fibers was 
      observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy analysis 
      (AFM) and XRD analysis, and quantitatively confirmed by thermogravimetric
      analysis (TGA) measurements. Good silver coating stability has been confirmed
      performing several industrial washing. Antimicrobial tests with Escherichia coli 
      were performed.

TI  - Nosocomial infection update.
PG  - 416-20
AB  - Historically, staphylococci, pseudomonads, and Escherichia coli have been the
      nosocomial infection troika; nosocomial pneumonia, surgical wound infections, and
      vascular access-related bacteremia have caused the most illness and death in
      hospitalized patients; and intensive care units have been the epicenters of
      antibiotic resistance. Acquired antimicrobial resistance is the major problem,
      and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is the pathogen of greatest
      concern. The shift to outpatient care is leaving the most vulnerable patients in 
      hospitals. Aging of our population and increasingly aggressive medical and
      surgical interventions, including implanted foreign bodies, organ
      transplantations, and xenotransplantation, create a cohort of particularly
      susceptible persons. Renovation of aging hospitals increases risk of airborne
      fungal and other infections. To prevent and control these emerging nosocomial
      infections, we need to increase national surveillance, "risk adjust" infection
      rates so that interhospital comparisons are valid, develop more noninvasive
      infection-resistant devices, and work with health-care workers on better
      implementation of existing control measures such as hand washing.

      behaviour of sodium carboxymethylcellulose and other macromolecules towards
      streptomycin sulphate (author's transl)].
PG  - 548-51
AB  - Unlike the other macromolecules under investigation (polyvinylpyrrolidone,
      methylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol), sodium carboxymethylcellulose acts on
      streptomycin sulphate, which leads to isolable precipitates. By equilibrium
      dialysis in electrolyte-free and electrolyte-containing solutions, the
      interaction was characterized in more detail and described by Donnan curves. The 
      associates (which contained, on an average, 40% of streptomycin) proved to be
      resistant to light and air, and stable to thin-layer chromatography.
      Microbiological assays on the test strain Bacillus subtilis SG119 revealed a
      decrease in activity of the streptomycin-sodium carboxymethylcellulose associates
      compared to pure streptomycin (tested in the solid form, using rice granulate as 
      a carrier substance). In contrast, the associate was as efficient as the
      antibiotic when dissolved in a concentrated solution of sodium chloride.

TI  - Fabrics for atopic dermatitis.
PG  - 63-5
AB  - The type of fabric worn by sufferers from atopic dermatitis should not exacerbate
      the condition but, if possible, help to control it. Synthetic fabrics and wool
      tend to produce itching and irritate the skin. Cotton is traditionally
      recommended but its structure contains short fibres which expand and contract,
      causing a rubbing movement that can irritate delicate skin. Dyes used in cotton
      garments can increase the potential of a sensitivity reaction. Cotton is also
      prone to bacterial and fungal attack. Silk garments are often closely woven which
      impedes the flow of air, and some people are allergic to the sericin protein in
      silk. Published studies suggest that a specially treated silk material
      (DermaSilk), which is loosely knitted, has had the sericin removed and has a
      microbial agent (AEM 5772/5) permanently bonded to it, is well tolerated and has 
      beneficial effects on the skin of children and adults with atopic dermatitis.
      Atopic dermatitis often becomes infected, commonly with Staphylococcus aureus.
      Some studies have investigated the use of clothing materials impregnated with
      substances such as silver, which has antimicrobial properties. However, these are
      still unproven and there are concerns about bacterial resistance and the local
      and environmental effects of silver. The use of the antimicrobial AEM 5772/5,
      which does not transfer to the skin of the patient, is a new development in the
      control of atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to determine whether an 
      antimicrobial shield bonded to clothing material will reduce the colonisation of 
      atopic skin by S. aureus.

AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to
      antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the
      hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery
      ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were
      detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps.
      aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9
      strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only
      one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being
      coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but 
      also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards
      and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains
      resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor
      (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container 
      with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to
      many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and
      infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains),
      Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 
      strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E.
      coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant
      strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel
      hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps.
      maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture.
      Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass,
      Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the
      pharmacies.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of multiple drug resistant type 6B Streptococcus
      pneumoniae in the Northern Territory and Queensland, Australia.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - The emergence of type 6B Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to five antibiotics
      (penicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole, erythromycin and
      tetracycline) in both the Northern Territory and Queensland prompted an
      investigation of the genetic relatedness and patterns of migration of the
      isolates. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA of 74 multiple
      drug-resistant (MDR) isolates cultured in both regions between August 1988 and
      June 1997 showed that 100% of MDR isolates from the Northern Territory and 96% of
      MDR strains from Queensland were genetically indistinguishable or closely related
      to the index strain. None of a further 65 type 6B isolates that were resistant to
      one or two, or susceptible to all of the above antibiotics, were clonally related
      to the MDR pneumococci. The geographical distribution of the MDR type 6B clone
      increased over time. The index strain, first isolated in Darwin in August 1988,
      was identified in Brisbane, 2900 km distant, less than 4 years later and
      subsequently in other Queensland centres. Surveillance programmes are important
      to monitor the emergence and spread of potentially invasive MDR pneumococcal
      clones in countries that are well serviced by air and road transport.

TI  - Potential use of copper surfaces to reduce survival of epidemic
      meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the healthcare environment.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - Epidemic meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (EMRSA) emerged in the early 
      1980s with EMRSA-15 and -16 being the most prevalent strains within the UK. MRSA 
      transmission between patients is largely via the hands of healthcare workers, and
      contamination of the hospital environment may occur. The objective of this study 
      was to evaluate the effectiveness of copper and brass to reduce the viability of 
      air-dried deposits of three MRSA strains [MRSA (NCTC 10442), EMRSA-1 (NCTC 11939)
      and EMRSA-16 (NCTC 13143)] compared with stainless steel. MRSA and EMRSA
      [10(7)colony-forming units (CFU)] were inoculated on to coupons (1 cm x 1 cm) of 
      copper, brass or stainless steel and incubated at either 22 degrees C or 4
      degrees C for various time periods. Viability was determined by resuspending
      removed CFUs and plating out on tryptone soy agar plates in addition to staining 
      with the respiratory indicator fluorochrome 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium. On
      pure copper surfaces, 10(7) MRSA, EMRSA-1 and EMRSA-16 were completely killed
      after 45, 60 and 90 min, respectively, at 22 degrees C. In contrast, viable
      organisms for all three strains were detected on stainless steel (grade 304)
      after 72 h at 22 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, complete kill was achieved on copper 
      for all three strains within 6 h. The results demonstrate an antimicrobial effect
      of copper on MRSA, EMRSA-1 and -16 in contrast to stainless steel. Consequently, 
      the contemporary application of stainless steel in hospital environments for work
      surfaces and door furniture is not recommended.

TI  - Mycoplasma iowae: a review.
PG  - 205-29
AB  - Mycoplasma iowae is an avian mycoplasma which has rather different properties
      from other avian mycoplasmas such as resistance to bile salts, predilection for
      the gastrointestinal tract and a relative resistance to many antimicrobials.
      There is also an unusually large degree of antigenic variation among strains
      belonging to this species. The Mycoplasma has been isolated from a number of
      avian hosts, but in natural infections the main manifestation is mortality of
      turkey embryos in the later stages of incubation. In experimental infections some
      strains cause chick and turkey embryo mortality and, depending on the route of
      infection and the age of bird, can give rise to joint and bone abnormalities and 
      occasional air sacculitis. In turkeys it is well known that the organism is
      egg-transmitted and can also spread laterally. In the mature bird the oviduct,
      semen and cloaca are sources of infection. Less is known about the natural
      infection in chickens. The humoral response in turkeys and chickens is poor and
      diagnosis is currently by culture although several polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) detection methods have been developed. Eradication from some turkey breeder
      flocks has been achieved by treating eggs with fluoroquinolones, monitoring the
      progeny for infection, and imposing stringent hygiene measures, especially at
      artificial insemination.

AB  - A method for detecting and measuring air contamination by drugs is described
      which uses an electrostatic bacterial air sampler, sprayers for micronizing
      drugs, and Mueller-Hinton medium seeded with a highly susceptible strain of
      Sarcina lutea. Three antibiotics (penicillin, tetracycline, aminosidine) and a
      sulfonamide (sulfapyrazine) were identified by pretreating portions of medium,
      showing no bacterial growth, with penicillinase or p-aminobenzoic acid solution
      and subsequently determining how both drug(-) susceptible and drug-resistant
      strains of Staphylococcus aureus were affected by this pretreatment. Quantitative
      determinations were also attempted by measuring the size of the inhibition zones.

LID - 10.1016/j.biortech.2009.03.068 [doi]
AB  - The practice of spreading of livestock wastes onto land used for the production
      of food or animal feeds is widely regarded as the least environmentally damaging 
      disposal method, however, the practice is still fraught with pitfalls such as N
      pollution of air and water and significant microbiological risks. Therefore this 
      paper focuses on some of the latest developments that provide new insights into
      the microbiological safety of animal manures, the related treatment options and
      the spreading the products onto land. In conclusion the paper stresses the need
      to fully address issues concerning environmental contamination and transmission
      of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through livestock manure, improve current
      environmental regulations regarding manure management practice and coordination
      of research activities and dissemination of technical information.

TI  - Chlorine gas exposure increases susceptibility to invasive lung fungal infection.
PG  - L765-73
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00030.2013 [doi]
AB  - Chlorine (Cl(2)) is a highly irritating and reactive gas with potential
      occupational and environmental hazards. Acute exposure to Cl(2) induces severe
      epithelial damage, airway hyperreactivity, impaired alveolar fluid clearance, and
      pulmonary edema in the presence of heightened inflammation and significant
      neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. Herein, we investigated whether Cl(2)
      exposure affected the lung antimicrobial immune response leading to increased
      susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Mice exposed to Cl(2) and challenged 
      intratracheally 24 h thereafter with the opportunistic mold Aspergillus fumigatus
      demonstrated an >500-fold increase in A. fumigatus lung burden 72 h postchallenge
      compared with A. fumigatus mice exposed to room air. Cl(2)-exposed A. fumigatus
      challenged mice also demonstrated significantly higher lung resistance following 
      methacholine challenge and increased levels of plasma proteins (albumin and IgG) 
      in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Despite enhanced recruitment of inflammatory
      cells to the lungs of Cl(2)-exposed A. fumigatus challenged mice, these cells
      (>60% of which were neutrophils) demonstrated a profound impairment in generating
      superoxide. Significantly higher A. fumigatus burden in the lungs of Cl(2)
      exposed mice correlated with enhanced production of IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL1, CCL2,
      and CCL3. Surprisingly, however, Cl(2)-exposed A. fumigatus challenged mice had a
      specific impairment in the production of IL-17A and IL-22 in the lungs compared
      with mice exposed to room air and challenged with A. fumigatus. In summary, our
      results indicate that Cl(2) exposure markedly impairs the antimicrobial activity 
      and inflammatory reactivity of myeloid cells in the lung leading to increased
      susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens.

TI  - Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula from Quebec dairy barns: application of simplified
      criteria for the identification of an agent responsible for farmer's lung
      disease.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (Micropolyspora faeni) is one of the major agents 
      responsible for farmer's lung disease, a form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It
      is frequently isolated from the air of contaminated barns. The identification of 
      this actinomycete is difficult because most of its phenotypic characteristics are
      variable and classical tests are not easy to perform on actinomycetes. Fatty acid
      analysis is very useful for the identification of these strains, but is not
      available except in some research or reference laboratories. Morphological
      (microscopic and macroscopic observations), physiological and biochemical tests
      (growth properties; macromolecules degraded; citrate utilisation and acid
      production from carbohydrates; resistance to antibiotics, lysozyme and heat),
      cell wall and fatty acid analyses and IgG analyses with serum from patients with 
      farmer's lung were performed on 12 environmental isolates presumed to be S.
      rectivirgula and two control strains of S. rectivirgula. From this, a simple and 
      rapid scheme for the identification of this actinomycete is proposed: optimal
      growth temperature (55 degrees C); colony appearance based on morphology
      (filamentous) and colour (beige to orange-brown); microscopic morphology (chains 
      of spores on both aerial and substrate mycelium); growth on NaCl 10%; cell-wall
      analysis (type IV); and the verification of antibody response with serum from a
      patient with farmer's lung. This last criterion is important to confirm the
      immunogenicity of the strains identified as S. rectivirgula. This scheme provides
      an accurate and efficient way of identifying S. rectivirgula strains and
      evaluating exposure to this bacterium. The study shows the limited value and the 
      lack of reproducibility of some classical biochemical tests.

TI  - New developments in the diagnosis and management of invasive fungal infections.
PG  - 88-93
AB  - Invasive fungal infections in cancer patients are on the increase. Candidemia is 
      now the fourth leading cause of bloodstream infections in many intensive care
      units (ICUs). Although a number of risk factors have been identified, antifungal 
      therapy should not be started in non-neutropenic patients until a diagnosis of
      invasive candidiasis or candidemia is made or presumed in order to avoid the
      development of resistance. Even a single positive blood culture should be
      treated, and requires removal of intravascular lines. Fluconazole is the first
      line agent for treatment candidemia other than that caused by Candida glabrata or
      C. krusei. High-resolution CT scan pictures showing a halo sign or crescent air
      sign are helpful for establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.
      Sandwich ELISA can be used to detect circulating galactomannan in serial serum
      samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood samples may also be used. There
      are only a few randomized studies of newly developed antifungal drugs compared to
      conventional amphotericin B (AmB). So far, both AmB colloidal dispersion and AmB 
      lipid complex have failed to show more favorable efficacy or lesser toxicity
      rates, except for nephrotoxicity. Liposomal AmB, used during febrile neutropenia,
      did have a significantly lower toxicity rate. In neutropenic patients with
      invasive fungal infections liposomal AmB proved to be better than conventional
      AmB in terms of clinical efficacy, mortality and nephrotoxicity rates. The use of
      tests to achieve an earlier diagnosis combined with more potent treatment
      formulations such as liposomal AmB may be significant steps towards successful
      management of invasive fungal infections.

TI  - [Prevention and control of nosocomial and health-care facilities associated
      infections caused by species of Candida and other yeasts].
PG  - 298-311
AB  - Knowledge of the epidemiology of invasive fungal diseases caused by yeasts
      (Candida spp., especially) in health care settings allows the establishment of
      the levels necessary for its prevention. A first step is to identify groups of
      patients at high risk of nosocomial invasive fungal infections, establish
      accurate risk factors, observing the periods of greatest risk, and analyze the
      epidemiological profile in genera and species as well as the patterns of
      antifungal resistance. Secondly, mechanisms to avoid persistent exposure to
      potential fungal pathogens must be programed, protecting areas and recommending
      measures such as the control of the quality of the air and water, inside and
      outside the hospital, and other products or substances able to cause outbreaks.
      Finally, apart from the correct implementation of these measures, in selected
      patients at very high risk, the use of antifungal prophylaxis should be
      considered following the guidelines published.

AB  - Antibacterial activity of negative air ions (NAI) on Escherichia coli and
      Pseudomonas fluorescens has been investigated. Appropriately diluted cell
      suspensions of E. coli and P. fluorescens were inoculated onto agar and exposed
      to NAI (> 2 x 10(6) ions/cm(3)) in an airtight chamber. Although no bacterial
      killing was observed after short exposure (15-30 min), longer exposure upto 4
      hours caused 33% and 42% reduction in viability of E. coli and P. fluorescens,
      respectively. Maximum killing was observed when the plates were positioned in
      front of the NAI generator. Young exponential phase cells of P. fluorescens were 
      more resistant (8% reduction in viability) as compared to stationary phase cells 
      (42% reduction in viability). Also, the starved cells displayed less reduction in
      viability (33%) as compared to normal cells (42%). The susceptibility of
      bacterial strains to NAI varies depending upon the strain type, their
      physiological state as well as the distance/orientation with respect to the
      source. Although application of NAI for decreasing the ambient microbial load is 
      a valid option; extended exposures might be required for controlling
      physiologically different cells such as exponential phase cells and/or starved
      cells.

AB  - Epidemiology examines the distribution and source of a disease in a population.
      Understanding epidemiology and disease transmission is vital to nursing care.
      Infectious disease transmission requires three components: an agent (virus,
      bacterium, parasite or other microbe), a vulnerable host and a conducive
      environment. Disease spread can occur through direct contact or via indirect
      methods (airborne droplets, vectors, fomites, water or food). Intervention can
      occur by attacking the agent (e.g., using microbicides), changing the environment
      (e.g., providing negative pressure rooms) or strengthening the host (e.g.,
      vaccination). Three epidemiologically relevant microbes are the SARS (severe
      acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus, methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). The first 
      is an emerging pathogen, and the latter two are existing agents that have mutated
      such that they are resistant to their standard treatments. For SARS, control
      measures include screening for possible cases and appropriate triage, respiratory
      and barrier precautions within the healthcare facility, and voluntary isolation
      in the community for contacts or healthcare workers who exhibit symptoms. Control
      measures for MRSA include the screening of patient lesions, isolating or
      cohorting patients who are already infected, covering wounds with impermeable
      dressings, treating staff and patient carriers with antibiotics, and improved
      hygiene. Control measures for C. difficile Control measures include paying close 
      attention to the hygiene of the clinical setting, disinfecting using bleach and
      the isolation of infected patients.

TI  - Zinc for severe pneumonia in very young children: double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial.
PG  - 1683-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young
      children. Early reversal of severity signs--chest indrawing, hypoxia, and
      tachypnoea--improves outcome. We postulated that zinc, an acute phase reactant,
      would shorten duration of severe pneumonia and time in hospital. METHODS: In a
      double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in Matlab Hospital, Bangladesh,
      270 children aged 2-23 months were randomised to receive elemental zinc (20 mg
      per day) or placebo, plus the hospital's standard antimicrobial management, until
      discharge. The outcomes were time to cessation of severe pneumonia (no chest
      indrawing, respiratory rate 50 per min or less, oxygen saturation at least 95% on
      room air) and discharge from hospital. Discharge was allowed when respiratory
      rate was 40 per minute or less for 24 consecutive hours while patients were
      maintained only on oral antibiotics. FINDINGS: The group receiving zinc had
      reduced duration of severe pneumonia (relative hazard [RH]=0.70, 95% CI
      0.51-0.98), including duration of chest indrawing (0.80, 0.61-1.05), respiratory 
      rate more than 50 per min (0.74, 0.57-0.98), and hypoxia (0.79, 0.61-1.04), and
      overall hospital duration (0.75, 0.57-0.99). The mean reduction is equivalent to 
      1 hospital day for both severe pneumonia and time in hospital. All effects were
      greater when children with wheezing were omitted from the analysis.
      INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant treatment with 20 mg zinc per day accelerates recovery
      from severe pneumonia in children, and could help reduce antimicrobial resistance
      by decreasing multiple antibiotic exposures, and lessen complications and deaths 
      where second line drugs are unavailable.

TI  - Office pediatrics: current issues in lower respiratory infections in children.
PG  - 111-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent estimates indicate that 1.9 million children worldwide 
      die each year from acute respiratory illnesses, many of which are lower
      respiratory infections (LRIs). Global threats from indoor and outdoor air
      pollution, urban crowding, biologic weapons, and worldwide rapid transportation
      complicate our efforts to reduce the impact of LRI disease in children. As new
      strategies are developed to limit the spread of LRI disease in children, existing
      pathogens become more complex to treat and newer pathogens emerge as causes of
      clinical disease. Most LRI disease is managed in outpatient settings and remains 
      a challenge to those who care for children. RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical pathogens
      (notably mycoplasma pneumoniae) are now known to cause a wide spectrum of
      disease, and with more extensive complications than previously recognized.
      Available data suggest a rapid increase in S. pneumoniae resistance to penicillin
      and macrolides in many cases of community acquired pneumonia, which has resulted 
      in shifts in outpatient (and inpatient) antibiotic treatment regimens. Human
      metapneumovirus (HMPV) is now recognized to cause LRI illness similar to
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and children. General strategies for
      the prevention of influenza infection are expanded to include many infants and
      young children, and are projected to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality
      from this key LRI pathogen. SUMMARY: The spectrum of LRI pathogens--and the
      clinical illnesses caused by them--continues to change. Innovations in
      immunotherapy and vaccines will be instrumental to reducing the burden of LRI
      morbidity in infants and children worldwide in the future.

      antimicrobial activity.
PG  - 1847-68
LID - 10.1007/s00253-011-3213-7 [doi]
AB  - The photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide are well known and have many
      applications including the removal of organic contaminants and production of
      self-cleaning glass. There is an increasing interest in the application of the
      photocatalytic properties of TiO(2) for disinfection of surfaces, air and water. 
      Reviews of the applications of photocatalysis in disinfection (Gamage and Zhang
      2010; Chong et al., Wat Res 44(10):2997-3027, 2010) and of modelling of TiO(2)
      action have recently been published (Dalrymple et al. , Appl Catal B
      98(1-2):27-38, 2010). In this review, we give an overview of the effects of
      photoactivated TiO(2) on microorganisms. The activity has been shown to be
      capable of killing a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,
      filamentous and unicellular fungi, algae, protozoa, mammalian viruses and
      bacteriophage. Resting stages, particularly bacterial endospores, fungal spores
      and protozoan cysts, are generally more resistant than the vegetative forms,
      possibly due to the increased cell wall thickness. The killing mechanism involves
      degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane due to the production of
      reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. This
      initially leads to leakage of cellular contents then cell lysis and may be
      followed by complete mineralisation of the organism. Killing is most efficient
      when there is close contact between the organisms and the TiO(2) catalyst. The
      killing activity is enhanced by the presence of other antimicrobial agents such
      as Cu and Ag.

TI  - Multi-resistant infections in repatriated patients after natural disasters:
      lessons learned from the 2004 tsunami for hospital infection control.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Infections are a frequent consequence of natural disasters. Repatriated victims
      may require hospital care due to multiple fractures, pneumonia or wound
      infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens that require specific infection
      control measures. To address potential pitfalls of infection control and clinical
      care in repatriated patients, we sought to provide microbiological insight into
      the possible origins of multi-drug antibiotic resistance in survivors of natural 
      disasters. A review of the medical literature was performed from 1986 to 2006
      with an emphasis on the 2004 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean. After natural 
      disasters, polymicrobial infections may occur following heavy inoculation during 
      trauma. Multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens are more prevalent than
      Gram-positive bacteria. A high incidence of extended spectrum
      beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and difficult-to-treat fungal infections in
      otherwise immunocompetent hosts may challenge routine hospital care. We recommend
      that survivors of natural disasters should be kept in pre-emptive contact
      isolation during air transport and hospitalisation until the results of all
      microbiological cultures become available. A meticulous diagnostic work-up is
      necessary upon admission and empiric antibiotic treatment should be avoided.
      Infections may also become manifest after several weeks of hospitalisation. In
      case of life-threatening infection, antibiotic therapy should cover
      non-fermenting pathogens.

      beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli from the hospital and municipal
      sewage to the water basin and to the air at the WWTPs (Waste Water Treatment
      Plants) area and their surroundings. Accordingly, it seems particularly
      interesting to trace the fate of these bacteria and their genes encoding
      antibiotic resistance in both untreated sewage from hospitals, and in sewage
      after different stages of purification, and finally to examine the degree of
      their emissions to environment. Although wastewater treatment processes reduce
      number of bacteria in sewage up to 99%, in the presented study it was reported
      that more than 2.7x10(3) CFU/mL E. coli reached the receiving water and
      contributed to dissemination of resistant bacteria into the environment. We
      received 395 E. coli strains from sewage and environmental samples and we
      investigated their antibiotic susceptibility and the presence of bla gene
      encoding TEM, CTX, OXA and SHV. From among 167 and 147 E. coli strains isolated
      from hospital effluents and municipal sewage in Olsztyn, Poland, up to 37.1% and 
      17.7%, respectively, were ESBL-positive. From among 38 and 43 strains isolated
      from river water and the air up to 18.4% and 27.9%, respectively, were
      ESBL-producers. The blaCTX-M (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-5, blaCTX-M-15)
      genes were the predominant group of the plasmid-coded ESBLs. More than 38% out of
      ESBL-producing isolates carried several bla genes. The
      multiple-antibiotic-resistant (MAR) indexes for ESBL-positive were higher than
      for ESBL-negative isolates and ranged from 0.45 to 0.63. The MAR indexes for E.
      coli from hospital effluents and air samples were greater than the indexes
      calculated for strains isolated from other samples. Presumably, the preliminary
      disinfection of hospital sewage before its inflow into the sewage system might
      minimize the spreading of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the environment.

TI  - Dynamic aspects of airborne bacterial flora over an experimental area in a suburb
      and distribution of resistant strains to antibacterial agents among airborne
      staphylococci.
PG  - 756-62
AB  - Airborne bacterial floras were investigated at stations A to E and P on the UOEH 
      campus located in a suburb of the city of Kitakyushu. Bacterial collections were 
      carried out by a filtration method using a soluble gelatin foam filter at an
      altitude of 1 m from the ground and viable bacterial cells were enumerated on
      nutrient agar plates supplemented with 50 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. At station
      P, where airborne bacterial composition was evaluated as a mean value of 20
      repeated experiments, there were 42% Gram-positive cocci, 37% Gram-positive rods,
      3.5% Bacillus strains and 5.5% Gram-negative rods. Fluctuating values of cell
      amounts for Gram-positive cocci and rods during these experiments suggested that 
      in the atmospheric layer near the ground, the former was a more transient group
      of airborne bacteria than the latter. When airborne bacterial flora over the
      experimental area was surveyed by observations at six stations, the dispersion
      profile of bacterial flora closely corresponded to vegetating states on the
      surface of the ground. Over vegetating areas, airborne bacterial flora appeared
      in about equal amounts of Gram-positive rods and cocci, while over bare ground,
      Gram-positive rods appeared more abundantly than Gram-positive cocci. To
      investigate the distribution of drug-resistant strains among airborne bacteria,
      sensitivity tests to six antibiotics were carried out with S. xylosus strains
      isolated at stations P and E. As a result, considerable amounts of
      single-drug-resistant strains for TC (DOX) and EM were recognized, but the
      distribution of multiple-drug-resistant S. xylosus was restricted to a few
      strains.

TI  - Destruction of planktonic, adherent and biofilm cells of Staphylococcus
      epidermidis using a gliding discharge in humid air.
PG  - 621-8
AB  - AIMS: To determine the efficiency of an electric discharge of the gliding arc
      type for the destruction of Staphylococcus epidermidis planktonic, adherent and
      biofilm cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial cells were treated in humid air and
      at atmospheric pressure by a nonthermal quenched plasma of the glidarc type. The 
      kinetics of destruction (followed by plating) were modelled by an Add-inn for
      Microsoft Excel, GInaFiT. For planktonic cells, log-linear destruction was
      obtained, whereas biphasic kinetics were observed for sessile cells. An increased
      resistance of biofilm cells was observed: the reduction of 6 logarithm units of
      the population was obtained in 15, 30 and 70 min for planktonic, adherent and
      biofilm cells, respectively. The experiments also show that the cells destruction
      did not depend on the adhesion surface but was governed by the gap between the
      target and the plasma source. CONCLUSION: The complete destruction of planktonic,
      adherent and more resistant biofilm cells of Staph. epidermidis is achieved by a 
      glidarc air plasma at atmospheric pressure. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:
      The glidarc plasma technology is a promising candidate among the emerging
      nonthermal techniques for decontamination, as it can destroy even biofilms that
      are known as particularly resistant to various antimicrobials.

TI  - The occurrence of Staphylococcus epidermidis in a department of thoracic and

PG  - 269-74
AB  - Changes in resistance traits of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated in the
      preoperative and postoperative phases from patients undergoing open heart surgery
      were studied in a two-step prospective investigation. Period 1 comprised 32
      patients. All received streptomycin for five days and methicillin for seven days,
      starting the evening before operation. None of the patients was colonized with
      multiresistant (MR) strains before or immediately after operation. Two days after
      operation, in the intensive care unit (ICU) 79% of the patients carried MR S.
      epidermidis in the nose. Air analyses showed that 30% of the bacteria isolated
      from the ICU were MR, while such strains were seldom found in the operating
      theatre. Nose swabs from the staff showed that 26% at the ICU and none in the
      operating theatre carried MR strains. In an attempt to counteract the selection
      for MR strains, all patients in period 2 received methicillin alone for only 3
      days, and disinfection of the ICU was then performed after each patient. Period 2
      comprised 105 patients. The frequency of MR S. epidermidis in the patient
      material declined from 80% to 40% and from 26% to 15% in the staff members. No
      changes were found concerning the frequency of postoperative complications. The
      conclusion is that methicillin alone for three days gives as good a protection
      against postoperative infections as a more broad-spectrum treatment and that
      reduced use of antibiotics will reduce the risk of early colonization with
      resistant strains.

TI  - Global Survey of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Air.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.8b02204 [doi]
AB  - Despite its emerging significant public health concern, the presence of
      antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in urban air has not received significant
      attention. Here, we profiled relative abundances (as a fraction, normalized by
      16S rRNA gene) of 30 ARG subtypes resistant to seven common classes of
      antibiotics, which are quinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines,
      sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and vancomycins, in ambient total particulate
      matter (PM) using a novel protocol across 19 world cities. In addition, their
      longitudinal changes in PM2.5 samples in Xi'an, China as an example were also
      studied. Geographically, the ARGs were detected to vary by nearly 100-fold in
      their abundances, for example, from 0.07 (Bandung, Indonesia) to 5.6 (San
      Francisco, USA). The beta-lactam resistance gene blaTEM was found to be most
      abundant, seconded by quinolone resistance gene qepA; and their corresponding
      relative abundances have increased by 178% and 26%, respectively, from 2004 to
      2014 in Xi'an. Independent of cities, gene network analysis indicates that
      airborne ARGs were differentially contributed by bacterial taxa. Results here
      reveal that urban air is being polluted by ARGs, and different cities are
      challenged with varying health risks associated with airborne ARG exposure. This 
      work highlights the threat of urban airborne transmission of ARGs and the need of
      redefining our current air quality standards in terms with public health.

TI  - Growth characteristics and influence of antibiotics on rough/smooth phenotypic
      variants of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - 490-5
AB  - Helicobacter pylori shows a rather high variability of several biochemical
      markers including lipopolysaccharide structures. This study aimed to determine
      whether Helicobacter pylori has a potential for phenotypic variability and to
      describe its effects on bacterial pathogenesis. From colonies of three clinical
      strains of Helicobacter pylori with rough (R) colony morphology, spontaneous
      phenotypic variants with smooth (S) colony morphology were isolated that occurred
      with a frequency of 10(-2) to 10(-3), irrespective of growth conditions.
      R-variant bacteria produced exclusively low-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide.
      They exhibited increased lysis in the presence of plain air. In contrast, the S
      variants produced low- and high-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide and did not
      exhibit increased lysis in the presence of plain air. Cocultivation of bacterial 
      cells with AGS stomach cancer cells revealed that R-variant bacteria but not
      S-variant bacteria effected an inhibition of high molecular-weight glycoprotein
      biosynthesis and secretion by the host cells. Skirrow supplement added as
      selective agent to liquid and/or solid media was tolerated to a similar extent
      among R- and S-variant bacteria, while all variants proved sensitive to
      metronidazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin except for the R and S isolates of 
      strain Hp57, which showed resistance to the latter compound. It was concluded
      that R- and S-variants of Helicobacter pylori may have distinct roles in
      pathogenesis; nevertheless, these bacteria may be isolated by traditional methods
      and eradicated by conventional anti-infective therapy.

TI  - The effect of leukocyte depletion on smoke inhalation injury in sheep.
PG  - 208-15
AB  - Leukocytes and the production of oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes have
      been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung injury after smoke inhalation. We
      investigated the mechanism responsible for this form of pulmonary damage in
      chronically prepared sheep previously made leukopenic with intra-arterial
      infusions of nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine hydrochloride). A control air
      insufflated group (sham: n = 6), a cotton smoke insufflated group (smoke: n =
      12), and a leukopenic cotton smoke insufflation group (smoked + depleted: n = 6) 
      were compared. Although both smoke insufflation groups had equivalent smoke
      exposure, which was indexed by carboxyhemoglobin, the smoked + depleted group had
      significant attenuation in the increases in pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary 
      vascular resistance, and pulmonary lymph flow. The PaO2 to FiO2 ratio (P:F) did
      not fall to the same extent, nor was there a fall in PaO2. The production of
      oxygen radicals, which was measured as plasma-conjugated dienes, and the
      consumption of antiprotease, as measured by alpha 2-macroglobulin levels in lung 
      lymph, were not changed in the smoked + depleted group, whereas it was elevated
      in the smoked group. We conclude that circulating leukocytes and the release of
      oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes contribute to the lung injury, pulmonary 
      microvascular permeability increase, and pulmonary edema seen after smoke
      inhalation.

TI  - Spread of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus to animals and humans: an
      underestimated role for the pig farm environment.
PG  - 2746-54
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkt289 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to discover the potential role of the pig
      farm environment in the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterococcus strains,
      including high-risk clones, to animals and humans. METHODS: Enterococcus isolates
      were recovered from a variety of samples (n = 82; swine,
      feed/medicines/antiseptics and pig farm facilities) from six Portuguese farms,
      most using antibiotics. Antimicrobial susceptibility/conjugation assays were
      performed by standard procedures, bacterial identification/screening of
      antibiotic resistance genes were performed by PCR and clonality was determined
      using PFGE/multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: Enterococcus isolates resistant
      to antibiotics (n= 473) were recovered from samples of different origin (swine,
      feed/antiseptics, animal residues and pig farm facilities), but only the
      clinically relevant species Enterococcus faecium (n = 171) and Enterococcus
      faecalis (n = 78) were included for further comprehensive molecular analysis.
      Isolates resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, erythromycin and
      aminoglycosides were better recovered in Slanetz-Bartley medium with these
      antibiotics present than in media not supplemented with antibiotics (P < 0.05).
      E. faecium was more frequently resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or
      nitrofurantoin and E. faecalis to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol or
      aminoglycosides (P < 0.05). Glycopeptide and erythromycin resistance rates were
      similar in both species. The transfer of resistance to several antibiotics,
      including vancomycin and ampicillin, was demonstrated. Clones associated with
      human infections were detected in different samples from the same farm [E.
      faecium from sequence type (ST) 78 lineage and E. faecalis ST16; manure, waste
      lagoons, faeces and drinking water] and in geographically distant farms [E.
      faecium clonal complex (CC) 5; E. faecalis CC21 and ST16]. CONCLUSIONS: The pig
      farm environment has an underestimated potential role in the transmission of MDR 
      Enterococcus to animals and, possibly, to humans. The continuous contact of swine
      with MDR Enterococcus by different routes (e.g. feed, dust, air and rooms) might 
      decrease the impact of restrictive antibiotic use policies and reinforces the
      need for different and preliminary interventions at the husbandry management
      level.

AB  - Variation in the quantity and quality of the essential oil (EO) of wild
      population of Origanum vulgare at different phenological stages, including
      vegetative, late vegetative, and flowering set, is reported. The oils of
      air-dried samples were obtained by hydrodistillation. The yield of oils (w/w%) at
      different stages were in the order of late vegetative (2.0%), early vegetative
      (1.7%), and flowering (0.6%) set. The oils were analyzed by gas chromatography
      (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 36, 33, and 16 components were
      identified and quantified in vegetative, late vegetative, and flowering set,
      representing 94.47%, 95.91%, and 99.62% of the oil, respectively. Carvacrol was
      the major compound in all samples. The ranges of major constituents were as
      follows: carvacrol (61.08-83.37%), p-cymene (3.02-9.87%), and gamma-terpinene
      (4.13-6.34%). Antibacterial activity of the oils was tested against three
      Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria by the disc diffusion method and
      determining their diameter of inhibition and the minimum inhibitory concentration
      (MIC) values. The inhibition zones and MIC values for bacterial strains, which
      were sensitive to the EO of O. vulgare subsp. glandulosum, were in the range of
      9-36 mm and 125-600 mug/mL, respectively. The oils of various phenological stages
      showed high activity against all tested bacteria, of which Bacillus subtilis was 
      the most sensitive and resistant strain, respectively. Thus, they represent an
      inexpensive source of natural antibacterial substances that exhibited potential
      for use in pathogenic systems.

TI  - [Clinical relevance of the Streptococcus milleri group in head and neck
      infections].
PG  - 14-21
AB  - Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, the 3 species of
      the S. milleri group, form part of the normal flora commonly found in the mouth, 
      throat, and gastrointestinal and genital tracts. This group has become known as
      an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical
      distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. We
      obtained 275 strains of the S. milleri group from different departments at our
      hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from
      internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32
      from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6
      from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. The 44 strains from
      head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with
      secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. The primary infection group
      included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4
      paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections, 
      2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound
      infection. The secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound
      infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3
      terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. The S.
      milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary
      infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. Among other organisms from the
      primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility tests of the S. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to
      CCL and 33% to CTM. ABPC, CPDX, and CFDN were also found to be less sensitive,
      although no resistant strains were detected. To adequately culture the S. milleri
      group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere 
      is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests. 
      Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological
      examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in
      unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative
      cases. With antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the S.
      milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections
      due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  - Activity of ketolide ABT-773 (cethromycin) against erythromycin-resistant
      Streptococcus pneumoniae: correlation with extended MLSK phenotypes.
PG  - 907-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (i) To determine the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of
      ABT-773, a novel ketolide, against sensitive and erythromycin-resistant
      pneumococci; (ii) to subdivide erythromycin-resistant pneumococci into resistance
      phenotypes, more extensive than the conventional M and MLS(B) groups, by
      assessing susceptibilities to, and interactions between, erythromycin
      (14-membered macrolide), clindamycin (lincosamide), rokitamycin (16-membered
      macrolide), ABT-773 (ketolide), quinupristin (streptogramin B) and dalfopristin
      (streptogramin A). METHODS: MICs and MBCs of ABT-773 were determined for 165
      strains of pneumococci (113 resistant to erythromycin). Extended phenotypes for
      the erythromycin-resistant strains were described in terms of intrinsic
      susceptibility to, and induction of resistance by, the antibiotics listed above. 
      RESULTS: Erythromycin-resistant strains could be divided into 10 extended
      phenotypes (designated II-XI), two of which (II and IX) predominated. ABT-773 at 
      0.12 mg/L inhibited 109 strains (median 0.03 mg/L). MICs for the other four
      strains (of phenotypes X and XI) were 0.25-1 mg/L. MICs were only slighter higher
      when measured on agar in CO(2) than by the NCCLS method (in broth in air). MBCs
      were usually < or = 2 x MIC, but for 10 strains (eight of phenotype X, one each
      of types IX and XI) MBCs were > 1 mg/L, and three of the latter (all type X) were
      tolerant. Clones of reduced susceptibility (MICs 1-8 mg/L, increased by up to
      32-fold) could be isolated from some strains of phenotypes VII, IX and X, but not
      from those of type II (efflux mechanism) or from erythromycin-sensitive strains. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ABT-773 was active against all 113 erythromycin-resistant
      pneumococci tested, which belonged to 10 phenotypes. Extended phenotyping of
      pneumococci revealed interesting and potentially useful subdivisions of the
      classical phenotypes.

TI  - Comparative transcriptome analysis of the CO2 sensing pathway via differential
      expression of carbonic anhydrase in Cryptococcus neoformans.
PG  - 1207-19
LID - 10.1534/genetics.110.118315 [doi]
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) sensing and metabolism via carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play 
      pivotal roles in survival and proliferation of pathogenic fungi infecting human
      hosts from natural environments due to the drastic difference in CO(2) levels. In
      Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes fatal fungal meningoencephalitis, the Can2 
      CA plays essential roles during both cellular growth in air and sexual
      differentiation of the pathogen. However the signaling networks downstream of
      Can2 are largely unknown. To address this question, the present study employed
      comparative transcriptome DNA microarray analysis of a C. neoformans strain in
      which CAN2 expression is artificially controlled by the CTR4 (copper transporter)
      promoter. The P(CTR4)CAN2 strain showed growth defects in a CO(2)-dependent
      manner when CAN2 was repressed but resumed normal growth when CAN2 was
      overexpressed. The Can2-dependent genes identified by the transcriptome analysis 
      include FAS1 (fatty acid synthase 1) and GPB1 (G-protein beta subunit),
      supporting the roles of Can2 in fatty acid biosynthesis and sexual
      differentiation. Cas3, a capsular structure designer protein, was also discovered
      to be Can2-dependent and yet was not involved in CO(2)-mediated capsule
      induction. Most notably, a majority of Can2-dependent genes were environmental
      stress-regulated (ESR) genes. Supporting this, the CAN2 overexpression strain was
      hypersensitive to oxidative and genotoxic stress as well as antifungal drugs,
      such as polyene and azole drugs, potentially due to defective membrane integrity.
      Finally, an oxidative stress-responsive Atf1 transcription factor was also found 
      to be Can2-dependent. Atf1 not only plays an important role in diverse stress
      responses, including thermotolerance and antifungal drug resistance, but also
      represses melanin and capsule production in C. neoformans. In conclusion, this
      study provides insights into the comprehensive signaling networks orchestrated by
      CA/CO(2)-sensing pathways in pathogenic fungi.

      nontoxic properties and its innate ability for antibacterial and hemostasis
      effects. In this study, the novel composites containing CS and cellulose (CEL)
      (i.e., [CEL + CS]), which we have previously synthesized using a green and
      totally recyclable method, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity,
      absorption of anticoagulated whole blood, anti-inflammatory activity through the 
      reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6),
      and the biocompatibility with human fibroblasts. The [CEL + CS] composites were
      found to inhibit the growth of both Gram positive and negative micro-organisms.
      For examples, the regenerated 100% lyophilized chitosan material was found to
      reduce growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739 and vancomycin resistant
      Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 51299) by 78, 36, and 64%, respectively. The
      composites are nontoxic to fibroblasts; that is, fibroblasts, which are critical 
      to the formation of connective tissue matrix were found to grow and proliferate
      in the presence of the composites. They effectively absorb blood, and at the same
      rate and volume as commercially available wound dressings. The composites, in
      both air-dried and lyophilized forms, significantly inhibit the production of
      TNF-alpha and IL-6 by stimulated macrophages. These results clearly indicate that
      the biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic [CEL + CS] composites, particularly
      those dried by lyophilizing, can be effectively used as a material in wound
      dressings.

AB  - The increasing risk of drug-resistant bacterial infections indicates that there
      is a growing need for new and effective antimicrobial agents. One promising, but 
      unexplored area in antimicrobial drug design is de novo purine biosynthesis.
      Recent research has shown that de novo purine biosynthesis in microbes is
      different from that in humans. The differences in the pathways are centered
      around the synthesis of 4-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR) which
      requires the enzyme N(5)-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (N(5)-CAIR)
      synthetase. Humans do not require and have no homologs of this enzyme.
      Unfortunately, no studies aimed at identifying small-molecule inhibitors of
      N(5)-CAIR synthetase have been published. To remedy this problem, we have
      conducted high-throughput screening (HTS) against Escherichia coliN(5)-CAIR
      synthetase using a highly reproducible phosphate assay. HTS of 48,000 compounds
      identified 14 compounds that inhibited the enzyme. The hits identified could be
      classified into three classes based on chemical structure. Class I contains
      compounds with an indenedione core. Class II contains an indolinedione group, and
      Class III contains compounds that are structurally unrelated to other inhibitors 
      in the group. We determined the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for five compounds
      representing each of the classes. Examination of compounds belonging to Class I
      indicates that these compounds do not follow normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
      Instead, these compounds inhibit N(5)-CAIR synthetase by reacting with the
      substrate AIR. Kinetic analysis indicates that the Class II family of compounds
      are non-competitive with both AIR and ATP. One compound in Class III is
      competitive with AIR but uncompetitive with ATP, whereas the other is
      non-competitive with both substrates. Finally, these compounds display no
      inhibition of human AIR carboxylase:SAICAR synthetase indicating that these
      agents are selective inhibitors of N(5)-CAIR synthetase.

TI  - Bronchopleural cutaneous fistula due to Eikenella corrodens.
PG  - 265-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to review the subject and to report on and
      discuss a case of bronchopleural cutaneous fistula due to Eikenella corrodens.
      DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old girl was brought to our hospital with fever and
      blood-tinged sputum 2 weeks prior to her admission. She suffered from neurologic 
      sequelae of herpetic encephalitis and had been bed-ridden since 5 years of age. A
      longitudinal paraspinal soft mass had been noted in the previous week by her
      mother. She had been given oral feeding despite frequent choking for the past few
      years. On palpation, the mass can be squeezed to follow the least resistance of
      subcutaneous space longitudinally extending to the lower thoracic region. Chest
      computed tomography scan revealed right lower lobe necrotizing pneumonitis and a 
      pleuro-cutaneous fistula leading to the subcutaneous air locules. A protracted
      course of antibiotics was prescribed and subcutaneous air trapping decreased in
      size over 8 weeks. COMMENTS: Eikenella corrodens has increasingly been implicated
      as a potential causative pathogen in pleuropulmonary infections. Pleuro-cutaneous
      fistula and abscess formation complicating empyema and necrotizing pneumonitis
      due to E. corrodens infection have not been reported. A bulging thoracic
      subcutaneous lesion waxes and wanes with respiration suggest the possibility of a
      pleruo-cutaneous fistula. Treatment of Eikenella empyema using antibiotics
      without surgical decortication requires a prolonged course of antibiotic therapy.

TI  - What animal models teach humans about tuberculosis.
PG  - 503-8
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2008-0154TR [doi]
AB  - Animal models have become standard tools for the study of a wide array of human
      infectious diseases. Although there are no true animal reservoirs for
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, many different animal species are susceptible to
      infection with this organism and have served as valuable tools for the study of
      tuberculosis (TB). The most commonly used experimental animal models of TB are
      the mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig. Although substantial differences in TB
      susceptibility and disease manifestations exist between these species, they have 
      contributed significantly to the understanding of TB immunopathogenesis, host
      genetic influence on infection, efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, and
      host/pathogen interactions that determine the outcome or severity of infection.
      Among the three species, mice are relatively resistant to TB infection, followed 
      by rabbits and then guinea pigs, which are extremely vulnerable to infection.
      Mice are most often used in experiments on immune responses to TB infection and
      drug regimens against TB. Rabbits, unlike the other two animal models, develop
      cavitary TB and offer a means to study the factors leading to this form of the
      disease. Guinea pigs, due to their high susceptibility to infection, have been
      ideal for studies on airborne transmission and vaccine efficacy. In addition to
      these three species, TB research has occasionally involved nonhuman primates and 
      cattle models. Current concepts in TB pathogenesis have also been derived from
      animal studies involving experimentally induced infections with related
      mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium bovis) whose manifestations in select animal
      hosts mimic human TB.

TI  - Filamentous fungi in a tertiary care hospital: environmental surveillance and
      susceptibility to antifungal drugs.
PG  - 60-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate filamentous fungi with respect to environmental load and
      potential drug resistance in a tertiary care teaching hospital. DESIGN: Monthly
      survey in 2 buildings of the hospital during a 12-month period. SETTING:
      Hippokration Hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece. METHODS: Air, surface, and tap
      water sampling was performed in 4 departments with high-risk patients. As
      sampling sites, the solid-organ transplantation department and the hematology
      department (in the older building) and the pediatric oncology department and the 
      pediatric intensive care unit (in the newer building) were selected. RESULTS:
      From January to May of 2000, the fungal load in air (FLA) was low, ranging from 0
      to 12 colony-forming units (cfu) per m(3) in both buildings. During the summer
      months, when high temperature and humidity predominate, the FLA increased to 4-56
      cfu/m(3). The fungi commonly recovered from culture of air specimens were
      Aspergillus niger (25.9%), Aspergillus flavus (17.7%), and Aspergillus fumigatus 
      (12.4%). Non-Aspergillus filamentous fungi, such as Zygomycetes and Dematiaceous 
      species, were also recovered. The pediatric intensive care unit had the lowest
      mean FLA (7.7 cfu/m(3)), compared with the pediatric oncology department (8.7
      cfu/m(3)), the solid-organ transplantation department (16.1 cfu/m(3)), and the
      hematology department (22.6 cfu/m(3)). Environmental surfaces were swabbed, and
      62.7% of the swab samples cultured yielded filamentous fungi similar to the fungi
      recovered from air but with low numbers of colony-forming units. Despite vigorous
      sampling, culture of tap water yielded no fungi. The increase in FLA observed
      during the summer coincided with renovation in the building that housed the
      solid-organ transplantation and hematology departments. All 54 Aspergillus air
      isolates randomly selected exhibited relatively low minimum inhibitory or
      effective concentrations for amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole,
      posaconazole, micafungin, and anidulafungin. CONCLUSION: Air and surface fungal
      loads may vary in different departments of the same hospital, especially during
      months when the temperature and humidity are high. Environmental Aspergillus
      isolates are characterized by lack of resistance to clinically important
      antifungal agents.

AB  - The conflict between hosts and microorganisms evidences the breakdown in the
      hosts' defence system or the acquisition of characters new to the infectious
      agents; it occurs constantly in the hospital environment and particularly in
      surgical intensive care units, due to the weakened defence system in the patient,
      contact with infected material, contamination of the environment, and resistance 
      of microorganisms to antibiotics. The sources of infectious agents are the
      patient himself, other patients, hospital personnel, visitors, inanimate
      surroundings, the air, materials used and/or nutrition, liquids, drugs,
      dressings, drainage, etc. These microorganisms cause postoperative infections,
      urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, and systemic infections.
      Preventive hygiene wards off or reduces these infections. Regular follow-up of
      results obtained can be documented by permanent epidemiological surveillance.

TI  - Deciphering cell wall integrity signalling in Aspergillus fumigatus:
      identification and functional characterization of cell wall stress sensors and
      relevant Rho GTPases.
PG  - 506-19

AB  - The fungal cell wall, a conserved and highly dynamic structure, is essential for 
      virulence and viability of fungal pathogens and is an important antifungal drug
      target. The cell wall integrity (CWI) signalling pathway regulates shape and
      biosynthesis of the cell wall. In this work we identified, localized and
      functionally characterized four putative CWI stress sensors of Aspergillus
      fumigatus, an airborne opportunistic human pathogen and the cause of invasive
      aspergillosis. We show that Wsc1 is specifically required for resistance to
      echinocandin antifungals. MidA is specifically required for elevated temperature 
      tolerance and resistance to the cell wall perturbing agents congo red and
      calcofluor white. Wsc1, Wsc3 and MidA additionally have overlapping functions and
      are redundantly required for radial growth and conidiation. We have also analysed
      the roles of three Rho GTPases that have been implicated in CWI signalling in
      other fungi. We show that Rho1 is essential and that conditional downregulation
      of rho1 or deletion of rho2 or rho4 results in severely impaired CWI. Our data
      indicate significant functional differences between the CWI stress sensors of
      yeasts and moulds.

TI  - Microbiology of bacterial respiratory infections.
PG  - S55-61
AB  - The upper respiratory tract may become susceptible to bacterial infection as a
      result of health conditions such as allergies and viral infections, as well as
      the effects of smoking and airborne environmental pollutants. Streptococcus
      pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common 
      bacterial pathogens in upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
      Streptococcus pyogenes is the predominant bacterial pathogen in pharyngitis and
      tonsillitis. Bacterial pathogens adhere to mucous membranes and colonization
      ensues. In an otherwise healthy individual the host immune system responds to the
      invading bacteria resulting in edema and swelling. If antimicrobial treatment
      does not eradicate the invading organisms and successfully interrupt the progress
      of the infection, the patient may develop recurrent or chronic disease. S.
      pneumoniae and other pathogens once susceptible to penicillin and other
      antibiotics are now becoming resistant. Bacterial resistance has developed and
      disseminated because of the widespread use of antibiotics. Major mechanisms of
      bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in upper respiratory tract infections
      include enzymatic inhibition, membrane impermeability, alteration of target
      enzymes, active pumping out of antibiotic and alteration of the ribosomal target.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135402 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to discern the contribution of poultry farms to the
      contamination of the environment with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and
      therewith, potentially to the spread of these bacteria to humans and other
      animals. ESBL-producing E. coli were detected at all investigated laying hen
      farms (n = 5) and broiler farms (n = 3) in 65% (46/71) and 81% (57/70) of poultry
      faeces samples, respectively. They were detected in rinse water and run-off water
      (21/26; 81%), other farm animals (11/14; 79%), dust (21/35; 60%), surface water
      adjacent to farms (20/35; 57%), soil (48/87; 55%), on flies (11/73; 15%), and in 
      barn air (2/33; 6%). The highest prevalence and concentrations in the outdoor
      environment were observed in soil of free-range areas at laying hen farms (100%
      of samples positive, geometric mean concentration 2.4x10(4) cfu/kg), and surface 
      waters adjacent to broiler farms during, or shortly after, cleaning between
      production rounds (91% of samples positive, geometric mean concentration
      1.9x10(2) cfu/l). The diversity of ESBL-producing E. coli variants with respect
      to sequence type, phylogenetic group, ESBL-genotype and antibiotic resistance
      profile was high, especially on broiler farms where on average 16 different
      variants were detected, and the average Simpson's Indices of diversity (SID; 1-D)
      were 0.93 and 0.94 among flock and environmental isolates respectively. At laying
      hen farms on average nine variants were detected, with SIDs of 0.63 (flock
      isolates) and 0.77 (environmental isolates). Sixty percent of environmental
      isolates were identical to flock isolates at the same farm. The highest
      proportions of 'flock variants' were observed in dust (94%), run-off gullies
      (82%), and barn air (67%), followed by surface water (57%), soil (56%), flies
      (50%) and other farm animals (35%).The introduction of ESBL-producing E. coli
      from poultry farms to the environment may pose a health risk if these bacteria
      reach places where people may become exposed.

TI  - The influence of antimicrobial peptides and mucolytics on the integrity of

      resistances.
PG  - 347-53
AB  - The integrity of biofilms on voice prostheses used to rehabilitate speech in
      laryngectomized patients causes unwanted increases in airflow resistance,
      impeding speech. Biofilm integrity is ensured by extracellular polymeric
      substances (EPS). This study aimed to determine whether synthetic salivary
      peptides or mucolytics, including N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid, influence
      the integrity of voice prosthetic biofilms. Biofilms were grown on voice
      prostheses in an artificial throat model and exposed to synthetic salivary
      peptides, mucolytics and two different antiseptics (chlorhexidine and Triclosan).
      Synthetic salivary peptides did not reduce the air flow resistance of voice
      prostheses afterm biofilm formation. Although both chlorhexidine and Triclosan
      reduced microbial numbers on the prostheses, only the Triclosan-containing
      positive control reduced the air flow resistance. Unlike ascorbic acid, the
      mucolytic N-acetylcysteine removed most EPS from the biofilms and induced a
      decrease in air flow resistance.

PG  - 1296-303

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia may lead to
      therapy-resistant, long-lasting post-giardiasis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
      We report two open pilot studies aiming to treat this condition, using either
      antibiotics or bacterio-therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty-eight patients with
      persistent abdominal symptoms, following clearance of G. lamblia infection, were 
      investigated. Eighteen received treatment with rifaximin plus metronidazole (8-10
      days) whereas 10 received a suspension of live faecal flora, installed into the
      duodenum during gastro-duodenoscopy. Customary abdominal symptoms and symptoms
      following a lactulose breath test were quantified by questionnaires. Hydrogen and
      methane production after lactulose were analysed in expired air and excretion of 
      fat and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was examined in faeces. RESULTS. As
      compared with pre-treatment values, total customary symptom scores were barely
      significantly reduced (p = 0.07) after antibiotics, but were highly significantly
      reduced (p = 0.0009) after bacterio-therapy. However, symptom improvement
      following bacterio-therapy did not persist 1 year later. Hydrogen breath
      excretion was slightly reduced after antibiotics, but not after bacterio-therapy.
      Compared with healthy persons, faecal excretion of fat was significantly
      increased in Giardia-cured patients. SCFAs were increased in the bacterio-therapy
      group, and were not influenced by therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Both antibiotics and
      bacterio-therapy were ineffective with respect to cure of post-giardiasis IBS.
      High faecal excretion of fat and SCFAs suggests that intestinal malabsorption of 
      fat and carbohydrates may play a role in the IBS-like complaints of these
      patients.

TI  - [Reduction of the incidence of nosocomial infections after assessing and revising
      the quality of assistance in a thoracic surgery unit].
PG  - 111-9
AB  - An active surveillance for nosocomial infections has been lead in a Thoracic
      Surgery with the intention, first to point out their frequency and
      characteristics, and then to outline all the measures to remove the main risk
      factors checking the results obtained. A prospective incidence study has been
      promoted in a Thoracic Surgery in the years 2000, 2001, 2002. The analysis has
      been lead weekly gathering all necessary data from the health records and making 
      laboratory tests to look for microbes growth in the air of Thoracic Surgery
      Operating Rooms. A nosocomial infections incidence of 13.3% among surgically
      treated patients has been registered in 2000. Deep surgical site infections were 
      the most frequent localizations, and microbes isolated were Staphylococcus aureus
      and coagulase negative Staphylococcus with an high oxacillin resistance
      (70.6%-76.5%). From the observation of the risk factors the sterilization system 
      has been modified and the assistance and environmental protocols have been
      improved. In the further evaluation period, a global reduction of nosocomial
      infections incidence (7.1%), of surgical site infections (from 10.1% to 4.5%) (p 
      = 0.007), of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus
      isolations have been obtained even if short results in antibiotic resistances
      have been registered. Thoracic Surgery has to be considered an area at
      medium-high risk of nosocomial infections. The quite high incidence of nosocomial
      infections recorded at the beginning of the study in presence of prevalent deep
      surgical site infections from staphylococci with an high oxacillin resistance
      compelled to promote corrections. These lead to a remarkable decrease in
      incidence of nosocomial infections even if the same results can not be reached in
      antibiotic resistances.

TI  - Effect of heat, acidification, and chlorination on Salmonella enterica serovar
      typhimurium cells in a biofilm formed at the air-liquid interface.
PG  - 1163-8
AB  - Bacterial biofilms have great significance for public health, since
      biofilm-associated microorganisms exhibit dramatically decreased susceptibility
      to antimicrobial agents and treatments. To date most attention has focused on
      biofilms that arise from the colonization of solid-liquid or solid-air
      interfaces. It is of interest that colonization of the interface between air and 
      liquid, which can be selectively advantageous for aerobic or facultative aerobic 
      bacteria, has been rarely studied, although it may present a major problem in
      industrial aquatic systems. In this work we investigated the role of a biofilm at
      the interface between air and liquid (pellicle) in the susceptibility of
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to stress conditions. For a control we
      used a mutant that had lost its ability to synthesize cellulose and thin
      aggregative fimbriae and thus did not produce the pellicle. Resistance of
      bacteria from the pellicle to heat, acidification, and chlorination was compared 
      to resistance of planktonic cells from the logarithmic and stationary phases of
      growth. Pellicle cells were significantly more resistant to chlorination, and
      thus the surrounding matrix conferred protection against the reactive sodium
      hypochlorite. However, the stress management of pellicle cells in response to
      heat and low pH was not enhanced compared to that of stationary-phase cells. A
      long-period of incubation resulted in endogenous hydrolysis of the pellicle
      matrix. This phenomenon provides a potential new approach to combat microbial
      cells in biofilms.

      interventions.
PG  - 204-19
LID - 10.1016/j.jhin.2008.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections (HAIs) increase morbidity, mortality
      and medical costs. In the USA alone, nosocomial infections cause about 1.7
      million infections and 99 000 deaths per year. HAIs are spread by numerous routes
      including surfaces (especially hands), air, water, intravenous routes, oral
      routes and through surgery. Interventions such as proper hand and surface
      cleaning, better nutrition, sufficient numbers of nurses, better ventilator
      management, use of coated urinary and central venous catheters and use of
      high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have all been associated with
      significantly lower nosocomial infection rates. Multiple infection control
      techniques and strategies simultaneously ('bundling') may offer the best
      opportunity to reduce the morbidity and mortality toll of HAIs. Most of these
      infection control strategies will more than pay for themselves by saving the
      medical costs associated with nosocomial infections. Many non-pharmacological
      interventions to prevent many HAIs will also reduce the need for long or
      multiple-drug antibiotic courses for patients. Lower antibiotic drug usage will
      reduce risk of antibiotic-resistant organisms and should improve efficacy of
      antibiotics given to patients who do acquire infections.

TI  - Effects of interferon and encephalomyocarditis virus on in vitro development of
      preimplantation mouse embryos with and without the zona pellucida.
PG  - 405-9
AB  - Development of preimplantation mouse embryos, with or without the zona pellucida,
      in the presence of interferon (IFN) and mouse encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus
      was studied using the in vitro culture method. The embryos (2- to 8-cell stages) 
      were obtained from superovulated mice and cultured in modified Witten's medium
      under paraffin oil in 5% CO2 in air at 37 degrees C. Removal of the zona
      pellucida does not affect the subsequent development of the embryos: 90% of
      embryos with and 87% of embryos without the zona pellucida reached the
      morula-early blastocyst stages. Mouse IFN (10(4) units/ml) had no inhibitory
      effect on the developmental ability of the preimplantation embryos with or
      without the zona pellucida: 88 and 89% of the embryos in each group,
      respectively, reached the morula-early blastocyst stages. The preimplantation
      mouse embryos were sensitive to the embryotoxic effect of EMC virus: at a
      multiplicity of 20 infection particles per embryo the development of 43% of
      embryos was inhibited. The zona pellucida had no significant protective effect:
      Its removal changed only slightly the susceptibility of the preimplantation
      embryos to this virus. Pretreatment of embryos with IFN did not protect them from
      the embryotoxic effect of EMC virus. This work indicates that preimplantation
      mouse embryos appear to be resistant for both the antiviral and antiproliferative
      activities of IFN.

TI  - Cellular events in the mechanisms of prosthesis loosening.
PG  - 51-81
AB  - The functional restoration of a joint damaged by trauma or disease is obtained by
      prosthetic surgery. In particular the implantation of hip prostheses is regarded 
      as routine in orthopedic surgery and thorough research has been developed in this
      field. The prosthetic replacement of the knee and even more so the ankle and
      elbow occurs less frequently in clinical practice and has been studied less
      intensively. The results of artifical hip replacement are generally good, both in
      terms of pain relief and the restoration of satisfactory joint function.
      Nevertheless, as time passes, a high rate of failures have been recorded due to
      prosthesis infections, fracture and wearing of the prosthetic components and
      prosthesis loosening by various causes. The use of ultra-filtered air and laminar
      flow in operating theatres and antibiotic prophylaxis have dramatically reduced
      the incidence of infections in total hip arthroplasty. Thanks to the setting up
      of new stem configurations and the use of superalloys that are highly resistant
      to fatigue failure, the fracture of the femoral component has been virtually
      eliminated as a complication of total hip arthroplasty replacements. Loosening is
      thus the most frequent complication in total hip replacement.

TI  - Microbial profile and antibiotic susceptibility of Campylobacter spp. and
      Salmonella spp. in broilers processed in air-chilled and immersion-chilled
      environments.
PG  - 948-56
AB  - Carcass chilling is considered a critical step for inhibiting bacterial growth
      during poultry processing. The objective of this study was to compare
      microbiological loads and the incidence of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.
      on broiler carcasses subjected to immersion chilling and air chilling.
      Additionally, the antibiotic resistance patterns of pathogen isolates were
      determined. The results of this study indicated that the incidence of Salmonella 
      spp. and Campylobacter spp. tends to be significantly lower in air-chilled
      broilers, suggesting that cross-contamination may be more prevalent for
      immersion-chilled broilers. No significant differences were detected between
      chilling treatments for total aerobic populations or for generic E. coli or
      coliform counts. Psychrotrophic populations were significantly larger (P < 0.05) 
      in immersion-chilled broilers than in their air-chilled counterparts.
      Campylobacter isolates from immersion-chilled broilers had a higher incidence of 
      resistance to nalidixic acid (NAL) and related fluoroquinolones than isolates
      from air-chilled broilers did. Additionally, Campylobacter isolates from
      air-chilled broilers had a higher frequency of resistance to tetracycline than
      isolates from immersion-chilled broilers did. With regard to Salmonella, isolates
      from immersion-chilled broilers had a higher incidence of resistance to NAL than 
      isolates from air-chilled samples did. No Salmonella isolates from immersion- or 
      air-chilled broilers were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested. The chilling 
      method used during processing may influence the microbial profile of postchilled 
      broilers.

PG  - 369-74
LID - 10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181d026f6 [doi]
AB  - In neonatal pneumonia, the surface activity of pulmonary surfactant is impaired
      and microorganisms may invade by passing the air-liquid interface. Previously, we
      have shown that addition of the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B (PxB) to
      modified porcine surfactant (pSF) improves resistance to surfactant inactivation 
      in vitro while antimicrobial activity of PxB is maintained. In this study, we
      investigated pSF/PxB in vivo. Neonatal near-term rabbits were treated with
      intratracheal pSF and/or PxB. Rabbits treated with only saline served as
      controls. Animals were ventilated with standardized tidal volumes and received
      approximately 10(7) Escherichia coli intratracheally. Plethysmographic
      pressure-volume curves were recorded every 30 min. After 240 min, animals were
      killed, the right lung and left kidney were excised, and bacterial growth was
      determined. The left lung was used for histologic analysis. Intratracheal
      administration of PxB +/- pSF significantly reduced the growth of E. coli
      compared with control animals or animals receiving only pSF. This was accompanied
      by reduction of severe inflammatory tissue destruction and significantly reduced 
      bacterial translocation to the left kidney. Animals receiving pSF + PxB had no
      difference in lung compliance compared with the pSF- or PxB-treated group.
      Mixtures of PxB and pulmonary surfactant show antimicrobial effects in neonatal
      rabbits and prevent systemic spreading of E. coli.

AB  - Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised
      patients. This report discusses bacterial and mycotic infections prophylaxis in
      the granulocytopenic patients with hematologic malignancies. Various strategies
      have been derived to prevent the infections: a combination of oral antibacterial 
      and antifungal prophylaxis with quinolones and newer azoles (fluconazole,
      itraconazole), high efficiency particulate air filtration, protective isolation
      and management of central venous catheter. However, the emergence of antibiotic
      resistant organism continues to pose a major challenge to the successful
      eradication and prevention of infections in neutropenic host, and demands the
      development of innovative approaches to antibiotic use and infection control
      procedures.

TI  - Pathogenesis of prosthesis-related infection.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - In spite of its incidence decreasing to 1% nowadays, prosthesis-related infection
      remains a research, diagnostic, therapeutic and cost-related problem. It can be
      defined as a presence of bacteria in the artificial joint space, which is
      significantly associated with evident laboratory and/or tissue markers, and
      clinical signs of running infection. We believe that the more precise
      understanding of pathogenesis, the more effective preventative and therapeutic
      measures, and the lower infection rate. The implants are colonized by airborne,
      skin-, and/ or surgeon-related bacteria during surgery despite being operated in 
      closely respected operating regime. Some prosthetic characteristics are
      advantageous and may play important roles in the process of bacterial adherence. 
      After successful attachment on the biomaterial surface bacteria multiply and
      physiologically transform into a "biofilm" community, making them much more
      resistant to antibiotic therapy and host immunity. Bacterial resistance is a
      complex phenomenon influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the
      cell configuration in the biofilm community. So the cure of periprosthetic sepsis
      without removing of all foreign bodies and necrotic bone fragments is often
      ineffective. Acute hematogenous sepsis is suggestive of a distortion of a
      previously aseptic joint space by invasion of bacteria through the vessels.

TI  - Coccidioidomycosis and tuberculosis coinfection at a tuberculosis hospital:
      clinical features and literature review.
PG  - 66-76
LID - 10.1097/MD.0b013e318194757a [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) and coccidioidomycosis can have similar clinical and radiologic
      presentations but require different treatments. Coinfection with TB and
      Coccidioides immitis is uncommonly reported and may be underdiagnosed in endemic 
      areas.We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients 
      admitted to a TB referral hospital between 1995 and 2007, and selected all cases 
      of TB and coccidioidomycosis coinfection in patients aged 18 years or older. All 
      admitted patients had a diagnosis of TB and had sputum cultures for both
      pathogens. We reviewed clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of the
      cases, and noted antimicrobial treatments received and outcomes.We identified 9
      patients, of whom 7 (78%) were Hispanic. Most patients were male (8/9, 89%), and 
      all were diagnosed with coccidioidomycosis after TB. Three (33%) patients had
      drug-resistant TB. Six patients had culture-positive TB at the time of the double
      diagnosis, and 2 patients developed active coccidioidomycosis during their
      hospital stay. Only 1 had human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency 
      syndrome (HIV-AIDS) (CD4 count, 20 cells/mm). All but 2 patients were treated
      with antifungal agents. Two patients died, 1 of whom had AIDS. Radiologic studies
      were unable to distinguish between TB and coccidioidomycosis, except for a
      patient who developed a new air-fluid level in a previously stable cavity.TB and 
      coccidioidomycosis coinfection should be suspected in coccidioidomycosis-endemic 
      regions among patients with TB who fail to improve clinically or radiologically
      despite adequate, culture-directed therapy.

TI  - Organic compounds inhibiting S. epidermidis adhesion and biofilm formation.
PG  - 881-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ultramic.2009.03.040 [doi]
AB  - The formation of biofilms on surfaces of indwelling medical devices is a serious 
      medical problem. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common pathogen found to
      colonize implanted devices and as a biofilm is more resistant to the host immune 
      system as well as to antibiotic treatments. Combating S. epidermidis infections
      by preventing or eradicating biofilm formation of the bacterium is therefore a
      medically important challenge. We report here a study of biofilm formation of S. 
      epidermidis on solid surfaces using a combination of confocal laser scanning
      (CLSM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in both air and aqueous environments. We
      have investigated the inhibitory effects of surfaces treated with four organic
      compounds, two benzoate derivatives denoted as compound 59 and 75 and two
      carboxamide derivatives denoted as compound 47 and 73, on S. epidermidis adhesion
      and biofilm formation. All four compounds evoke significant inhibitory effects on
      the formation of S. epidermidis biofilms with compounds 47 and 73 being most
      effective. None of the compounds were found to inhibit growth of S. epidermidis
      in liquid cultures. Bacteria attached to the substrate when exposed to the
      compounds were not affected indicating that these compounds inhibit initial
      adhesion. These results suggest a pretreatment for medically implanted surfaces
      that can prevent the biofilm formation and reduce infection.

TI  - Trichosporonosis in patients with neoplastic disease.
PG  - 268-79
AB  - Trichosporonosis due to Trichosporon beigelii or T. capitatum is an infrequent
      but potentially fatal invasive fungal infection in cancer patients. We studied
      epidemiologic, clinical, pathologic, and microbiologic features of this infection
      during a 7-year period at the University of Maryland Cancer Center. Fifteen
      patients with involvement by Trichosporon were identified: 5 were infected, 5
      were possibly infected, and 5 were colonized but not infected by Trichosporon.
      Four of the infected patients had trichosporonemia and/or positive skin biopsy
      cultures as the first evidence of infection. The fifth infected patient had
      positive marrow and skin biopsy cultures. Serial surveillance cultures of
      infected patients showed preceding Trichosporon colonization in only 1 of 5
      cases. Pulmonary infiltrates in 3 infected patients correlated at postmortem
      examination with Trichosporon pneumonia. Renal dysfunction marked by proteinuria,
      hematuria, red blood cell casts and azotemia correlated with widespread
      glomerular infiltration with the fungus. The five infected patients died of their
      infection, whereas the 2 possibly infected patients who died succumbed to their
      underlying illness. Trichosporonemia may have been averted in possibly infected
      patients because of a shorter median duration of profound (less than
      100/microliter) neutropenia (5 days) when compared to that of infected patients
      (20 days). No environmental source of Trichosporon was found in environmental
      surveillance cultures of food, air, or inanimate surfaces. In vitro studies of
      three pathogenic strains showed resistance to 5-fluorocytosine but susceptibility
      to amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and miconazole. Norfloxacin augmented the
      in-vitro antifungal activity of amphotericin B. Trichosporon must be considered
      an opportunistic pathogen that can cause serious infections among patients with
      cancer.

TI  - A simultaneous onset of organizing pneumonia and rheumatoid arthritis, along with
      a review of the literature.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a specific type of interstitial pneumonia that has
      been noted as one of the pulmonary manifestations during the course of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). In this study, we report a case with a simultaneous development
      of OP and RA. The patient presented with concurrent flu-like symptoms and
      arthralgia of multiple joints, and antibiotic therapy was not effective. The
      rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies were both high.
      Multiple air-space opacities on chest radiographs and bilateral peripheral
      consolidations on high-resolution computed tomography films were evident. The
      histology of transbronchial lung biopsy samples was characterized by
      intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue consisting of intermixed myofibroblasts
      and connective tissues. Treatment with prednisolone induced a complete recovery
      from OP without relapses. Our review of previous reports about RA-associated OP
      (RA-OP) suggested that the high titer of RF and increased disease activity of RA 
      indicate a great risk of developing OP. This condition may represent a lung's
      reaction in the RA-associated inflammatory and/or immune process. We should be
      aware of RA-OP cases in which pulmonary manifestations precede articular
      symptoms. In these cases, respiratory manifestations are the main evidence of RA 
      activity. In most cases of steroid-resistant RA-OP, the use of immunosuppressants
      was effective. Since OP may progress to fibrotic lung disease during the course
      of RA, we may consider performing a second lung biopsy for steroid-resistant
      patients, even if they have once been diagnosed as OP.

TI  - Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides as anticancer and hypoxia-selective drugs.
PG  - 679-84
AB  - Hypoxic cells which are found in solid tumors are resistant to anticancer drugs
      and radiation therapy. Thus, for effective anticancer chemotherapy, it is
      important to identify drugs with selective toxicity towards hypoxic cells.
      Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides (QdNOs) are heterocyclic aromatic N-oxides that have
      been found to possess potent antibacterial activities (inhibit microbial DNA
      synthesis) especially under anaerobic conditions; thus they are under evaluation 
      as bioreductive drugs for the treatment of solid tumors (1). We investigated the 
      ability of four differently substituted QdNOs to inhibit cell growth and induce
      cell cycle changes in two human tumorigenic epithelial cell lines under oxic
      conditions. We also evaluated the toxicity of these drugs to cancer cells
      cultured under hypoxic conditions. Two epithelial cell lines (the T-84 human
      colon cancer-derived cell line, and the SP-1 keratinocyte cell line) were treated
      with various doses of the QdNOs and harvested at different times after treatment.
      Proliferation and cell cycle results showed a structure-function relationship in 
      the activity of the various QdNO compounds with the
      2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6,7-dichloro-derivative of QdNO (DCBPQ) being the most potent 
      cytotoxin and hypoxia-selective drug. The 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl (BPQ) and the
      2-acyl-3-methyl-derivative of QdNO (AMQ) were less cytotoxic but arrested almost 
      50% of the cells in the G2M phase of the cell cycle at doses of 30 and 120
      microM, respectively. The tetramethylene derivative of QdNO (TMQ) did not affect 
      the growth and cycling of cells cultured in air and was the least potent
      cytotoxin to hypoxic cells. Our results indicate that the QdNOs are
      hypoxia-cytotoxic drugs whose activity varies according to the substituents on
      the quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide heterocycle. Because of their selective toxicity to
      hypoxic cells (cells found in human tumors), these drugs may provide useful
      therapeutic agents against solid tumors.

TI  - Characterization of the risk to human health of pathogenic Escherichia coli
      isolates from chicken carcasses.
PG  - 741-6
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk for human health associated
      with pathogenic Escherichia coli isolated from airsacculitis and cellulitis in
      chickens, by comparing the genotypic and phenotypic profiles of avian E. coli
      isolates and E. coli strains isolated from sick humans during the same period and
      in the same geographical area as the avian isolates. A total of 96 isolates and
      46 isolates from lesions of cellulitis and airsacculitis, respectively, were
      obtained. Isolates from the backs of some of the affected and healthy birds and
      91 intestinal and extraintestinal isolates from humans with diarrhea, urinary
      tract infections, or septicemia were examined. The frequency of antimicrobial
      resistance was in general higher in the avian than in the human isolates.
      VT1-VT2-Eae and VT2-Eae, pathotypes associated with hemolytic and uremic syndrome
      and bloody diarrhea in humans, were the most frequently encountered pathotypes in
      human intestinal isolates but were not recovered from the avian isolates.
      Aero-Pap-TSH and Aero-TSH were the most frequently encountered pathotypes in
      avian isolates but were rarely observed in human isolates. No avian isolate was
      of serogroup O157, whereas many human isolates belonged to this O group. O78 and 
      O2 were the most frequently observed O groups in avian isolates but were rarely
      found in human isolates. Only two avian isolates demonstrated possible
      relatedness to human isolates based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles,
      but they belonged to different pathotypes. Our results suggest that avian
      isolates recovered from cellulitis and air sacullitis possess very few of the
      attributes required to cause diseases in humans. It is also concluded that
      isolates from cellulitis and airsacculitis do not represent a greater hazard than
      isolates from the back of healthy birds.

AB  - Cationic surfaces with alkylated quaternary-ammonium groups kill adhering
      bacteria upon contact by membrane disruption and are considered increasingly
      promising as a non-antibiotic based way to eradicate bacteria adhering to
      surfaces. However, reliable in vitro evaluation methods for bacterial
      contact-killing surfaces do not yet exist. More importantly, results of different
      evaluation methods are often conflicting. Therefore, we compared five methods to 
      evaluate contact-killing surfaces. To this end, we have copolymerized
      quaternary-ammonium groups into diurethane dimethacrylate/glycerol dimethacrylate
      (UDMA/GDMA) and determined contact-killing efficacies against five different
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Spray-coating bacteria from an aerosol
      onto contact-killing surfaces followed by air-drying as well as ASTM E2149-13a
      (American Society for Testing and Materials) were found unsuitable, while the
      Petrifilm(R) system and JIS Z 2801 (Japanese Industrial Standards) were found to 
      be excellent methods to evaluate bacterial contact-killing surfaces. It is
      recommended however, that these methods be used in combination with a zone of
      inhibition on agar assay to exclude that leakage of antimicrobials from the
      material interferes with the contact-killing ability of the surface. STATEMENT OF
      SIGNIFICANCE: Bacterial adhesion to surfaces of biomaterials implants can be
      life-threatening. Antimicrobials to treat biomaterial-associated infections often
      fail due to the bacterial biofilm-mode-of-growth or are ineffective due to
      antibiotic-resistance of causative organisms. Positively-charged, quaternized
      surfaces can kill bacteria upon contact and are promising as a
      non-antibiotic-based treatment of biomaterial-associated infections. Reliable
      methods to determine efficacies of contact-killing surfaces are lacking, however.
      Here, we show that three out of five methods compared, including an established
      ASTM, are unsuitable. Methods found suitable should be used in combination with a
      zone-of-inhibition-assay to establish absence of antimicrobial leaching,
      potentially interfering with contact-killing. Identification of suitable assays
      for evaluating bacterial contact-killing will greatly assist this emerging field 
      as an alternative for antibiotic-based treatment of
      biomaterial-associated-infections.

TI  - Hygiene and room climate in the operating room.
PG  - 293-9
AB  - The ventilation system is not the most important source to cause surgical site
      infections via the air. More important is the skin of both staff and patients.
      The literature did not reveal any reduction of the risk of surgical site
      infections resulting from the employment of ultra-clean air-systems during
      surgical procedures, the one exception being high risk operations such as
      orthopaedic implant surgery. Both ultra-clean air and antimicrobial prophylaxis
      can reduce the incidence of surgical site infections. If HEPA filters are used,
      they are only necessary directly in the operating rooms. Other rooms such as the 
      washroom, the anaesthesia preparation room or corridors which are connected to
      the OR do not have to be treated with HEPA filters. If a laminar air-flow system 
      is installed, there are some factors which have to be considered. The number of
      operating lamps and the heads of the operating team affect the function of the
      air ceiling as they form thermic and air-flow resistance and create turbulences. 
      Also, forced air-warming systems, which are used to maintain normal body
      temperatures for patients during surgery, disturb the ultra-clean field through
      the air emitted from the blankets used. Moreover, any medical equipment which is 
      cooled by integrated cooling blowers can influence an ultra-clean air system.
      Existing ventilation systems are not able to create good room conditions for all 
      persons inside the OR. Therefore new ways have to be found to create a room
      climate taking into account the level of activity.

AB  - We analyzed the parameters predictive of identification of methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in sample performed in hospitalized patients.
      One hundred six Staphylococcus epidermidis strains (60 MRSE and 46 MSSE) were
      collected. Three variables were independently linked to MRSE isolation in
      multivariate analysis: hospitalization during the month preceding the current
      admission; on-going antimicrobial therapy before sampling, and on-going infection
      at the time of sampling. MRSE isolation was associated with a poor vital
      prognosis. The air and surfaces sampling in the rooms of two patients with nasal 
      MRSE carriage yielded the same strains as those carried by the patient, and could
      play a role in the epidemiological chain of hospital-acquired MRSE infections.

TI  - Characterization of airborne viromes in cheese production plants.
LID - 10.1111/jam.14046 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To characterize airborne virus like particles isolated from two cheese
      production plants in order to reveal their complexity in terms of viral
      communities and microbial genes potentially mobilized by viruses. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Airborne virus like particles have been isolated from Grana Padano and
      Gorgonzola PDO cheese production plants and ripening cellars. A shotgun
      metagenomics analysis of the isolated viromes highlighted a high complexity of
      the viral communities both in terms of viral taxonomy and phage-host
      associations. Bacterial reads in each of the viromes were confirmed to be
      abundant and their taxonomy appeared to be associated to the environmental
      parameters and the technological processes that characterize the sampling area.
      Antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in each virome thus confirming
      that phages could be involved in the mobilization of antimicrobial resistances
      among bacterial populations. Interestingly human viruses were also identified
      even if the contamination source was not revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental
      conditions, which are imposed by the technology of the dairy process, seams to
      shape the viral populations as a consequence of the adaptation of microbial taxa 
      to those environments. The identification of sequences belonging to Legionella
      pneumophila and to the human papillomavirus, raised some considerations about the
      safety of cheese ripening cellars. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In
      conclusion, the analysis of the dairy airborne viromes, has revealed a high
      complexity of the viral communities even if the environments where the samples
      were collected were confined environments. Metagenomics of airborne viral
      population could be a promising monitoring tool for the biological
      characterization of dairy environments. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - A total of 965 strains of Micrococcaceae isolated from 200 patients, personnel,
      and air in a department of cardiac surgery were classified by means of
      Baird-Parker's scheme. The majority of strains were identified as Staphylococcus 
      epidermidis (S. epidermidis) biotype 1, but S. epidermidis biotype 4 accounted
      for c. 25% of isolates from patients post-operatively. Pre-operative isolates
      were generally sensitive to most antibiotics tested while post-operative strains 
      of coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae from patients and isolates from personnel
      and air were frequently multiply-resistant. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S. 
      aureus) were sensitive or resistant only to penicillin. More patients were
      colonized with coagulase-negative Micrococcaceae after operation than at
      admission to the hospital (p less than 0.001), while the frequency of S. aureus
      carriers was the same before and after operation and equal to the frequency found
      earlier. The frequency of S. aureus carriers among the personnel, however, was
      lower than reported earlier (10%). Multiply-resistant strains of S. epidermidis
      seem to have replaced resistant strains of S. aureus as the predominant hospital 
      saprophyte among Micrococcaceae.

TI  - Human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria in bioaerosols of swine
      confinement buildings and in nasal flora of hog producers.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijheh.2010.09.008 [doi]
AB  - Swine confinement buildings in eastern Canada are enclosed and equipped with
      modern production systems to manage waste. Bioaerosols of these swine confinement
      buildings could be contaminated by human pathogens and antimicrobial resistant
      bacteria which could colonize exposed workers. We therefore wanted to analyze
      bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and nasal flora of Canadian hog
      producers to evaluate possible colonization with human pathogens and
      tetracycline-resistant bacteria. Culturable and non-culturable human pathogens
      and tet genes were investigated in the bioaerosols of 18 barns. The nasal
      passages of 35 hog producers were sampled and total DNA was extracted from the
      calcium-alginate swabs to detect, by PCR, Campylobacter, C. perfringens,
      Enterococcus, E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, tetA/tetC, tetG and ribosomal
      protection protein genes. Airborne culturable C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E.
      coli, and Y. enterocolitica were present in the bioaerosols of 16, 17, 11 and 6
      of the 18 facilities. Aerosolized total (culturable/non culturable)
      Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli and Y. enterocolitica were
      detected in 10, 6, 15, 18 and 2 barns, respectively. Tet genes were found in
      isolates of culturable human pathogens. TetA/tetC, tetG and ribosomal protection 
      protein genes were detected in the bioaerosols of all 18 studied buildings.
      Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were 
      found respectively in 4, 9, 17, 14 and one nasal flora of workers. One and 10
      workers were positive for tetA/tetC and tetG genes, respectively. In swine
      confinement buildings, hog producers are exposed to aerosolized human pathogens
      and tetracycline-resistant bacteria that can contaminate the nasal flora.

TI  - Effects of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance and removal of fecal indicator
      bacteria in aerated and unaerated leachfield mesocosms.
PG  - 1571-8
AB  - Antibiotics can be present in low concentrations in domestic wastewater, but
      little is known about their effect on bacteria in onsite wastewater treatment
      systems. Mesocosms, consisting of soil-filled lysimeters representing the
      leachfield of a septic system under aerated (AIR) and unaerated (LEACH)
      conditions, were used to study the effects of tetracycline addition (5 mg L(-1)) 
      to septic tank effluent on tetracycline resistance in the fecal indicator
      bacteria Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, and on their removal. The
      mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52
      days. The fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to
      that in septic tank effluent, GammaRes, for E. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the 
      AIR treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the LEACH treatment. For fecal streptococci, 
      GammaRes ranged from 0 to 0.41 and from 0.63 to 1.06 in the AIR and LEACH
      treatments, respectively. No significant differences in antibiotic resistance of 
      fecal indicator bacteria were observed among sampling dates in soil or water from
      either treatment. Tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal
      indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100% for E. coli and from 95.9 to
      100% for fecal streptococci. Our results suggest that short-term addition of
      tetracycline at environmentally-relevant concentrations is likely to have minimal
      consequences on pathogen removal from wastewater and development of antibiotic
      resistance among pathogenic bacteria in leachfield soil.
