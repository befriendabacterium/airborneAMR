Aerosolized particles were detected using an optical particle counter for real-time measurement and with an Andersen sampler to detect viable MRSA. Molecular typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed on samples collected. Viable MRSA organisms isolated inside the swine facility were primarily associated with particles >5 mu m, and those isolated downwind from the swine facility were associated with particles <5 mu m. MRSA isolates included spa types t008, t034, and t5706 and were resistant to methicillin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin. Animal feed both before and after entry into the swine facility tested positive for viable MRSA. These isolates were of similar spa types as the airborne MRSA organisms. Air samples collected after power washing with a biocide inside the swine facility resulted in no viable MRSA organisms detected. This pilot study showed that the ecology of MRSA is complex. Additional studies are warranted on the maximum distance that viable MRSA can be emitted outside the facility, and the possibility that animal feed may be a source of contamination.","Ferguson, DD (Reprint Author), Univ Iowa, Dept Occupat Environm Hlth, 105 River St,CPHB Suite 329, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.

Despite human health risks, very little is known about the composition and diversity of airborne bacteria from hog farms and hog-related spray fields. We used pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes to compare airborne bacterial communities in a North Carolina hog farm and lagoon spray field. In addition, we isolated and identified antibiotic-resistant bacteria from both air samples. Based on 16S rRNA gene,pyrosequene analysis, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in airborne bacterial communities from both hog farm and spray field sites. Within the Firmicutes genera, Clostridium spp. were more abundant in the hog farm, whereas Staphylococcus spp. were higher in the spray field. The presence of opportunitic pathogens, including several Staphylococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes, was detected in both bioaerosol communities based on phylogenetic analysis. The isolation and identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from air samples also showed similar results with dominance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in both hog farm and spray field air. Thus, the existence of opportunistic pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria in airborne communities evidences potential health risks to farmers and other residents from swine bioaerosol exposure.","Song, B (Reprint Author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol \& Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.

Bacterial lineages present in the poultry bioaerosols clustered apart from those present in the pig bioaerosols and among the different phases of pig production, suggesting that different livestock as well as production phase were associated with a distinct airborne microbial community.

To answer this question, we exposed three groups of nine MRSA-negative tested piglets each to a defined airborne MRSA concentration (10(2), 10(4), and 10(6) cfu/m(3)) in our aerosol chamber for 24 h. In the following observation period of 21 days, the MRSA status of the piglets was monitored by taking different swab samples (nasal, pharyngeal, skin, conjunctival, and rectal swab). At the end of the experiment, we euthanized the piglets and investigated different tissues and organs for the spread of MRSA. The data of our study imply the presence of an airborne MRSA colonization route: the animals exposed to 10(6) cfu/m(3) MRSA in the air were persistent colonized. The piglets exposed to an airborne MRSA concentration of 10(4) cfu/m(3) were transient, and the piglets exposed to an airborne MRSA concentration of 10(2) cfu/m(3) were not colonized.

As a result, retail pork products, as well as surface and groundwaters contaminated with swine waste, have been shown to be sources of human exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, it is unclear whether the air within swine operations also serves as a source of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. To investigate this issue, we sampled the air within a concentrated swine feeding operation with an all-glass impinger. Samples were analyzed using a method for the isolation of Enterococcus. A total of 137 presumptive Enterococcus isolates were identified to species level using standard biochemical tests and analyzed for resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin using the agar dilution method. Thirty-four percent of the isolates were confirmed as Enterococcus, 32\% were identified as coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 33\% were identified as viridans group streptococci. Regardless of bacterial species, 98\% of the isolates expressed high-level resistance to at least two antibiotics commonly used in swine production. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic that has never been approved for use in livestock in the United States. In conclusion, high-level multidrug-resistant Enterococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and viridans group streptococci were detected in the air of a concentrated swine feeding operation. These findings suggest that the inhalation of air from these facilities may serve as an exposure pathway for the transfer of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens from swine to humans.","Schwab, K (Reprint Author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, 615 N Wolfe St,Room E6620, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.

In this study we assessed the prevalence of concomitant colonization with livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) and enterobacteriaceae expressing extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBL-E) in farms at the German-Dutch border region. Nasal colonization of pigs with MRSA (113/547 (20.7\%)) was less frequent than rectal colonization with ESBL-E (163/540 (30.2\%)). On the individual farm level MRSA correlated with ESBL-E recovery. The data further provide information on prevalence at different stages of pig production, including abattoirs, as well as in air samples and humans living and working on the farms. Notably, MRSA was detected in stable air samples of 34 out of 35 pig farms, highlighting air as an important MRSA transmission reservoir. The majority of MRSA isolates, including those from humans, displayed tetracycline resistance and spa types t011 and t034 characteristic for LA-MRSA, demonstrating transmission from pigs to humans. ESBL-E positive air samples were detected on 6 out of 35 farms but no pig-to-human transmission was found. Detection of ESBL-E, e.g. mostly Escherichia coli with CTX-M-type ESBL, was limited to these six farms. Molecular typing revealed transmission of ESBL-E within the pig compartments; however, related strains were also found on unrelated farms. Although our data suggest that acquisition of MRSA and ESBL-E might occur among pigs in the abattoirs, MRSA and ESBL-E were not detected on the carcasses. Altogether, our data define stable air (MRSA), pig compartments (ESBL-E) and abattoir waiting areas (MRSA and ESBL-E) as major hot spots for transmission of MRSA and/or ESBL-E along the pig production chain.","Bekeredjian-Ding, I (Reprint Author), Univ Hosp Bonn, Inst Med Microbiol Immunol \& Parasitol, Bonn, Germany.

Samples from outside (including ground surfaces, ambient air, slurry and digestate from biogas plants) and, in parallel, from inside the pig barns (including pig feces, dust, barn air, flies and mice feces) were examined for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli and selected isolates were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. 14/17 (82.4%) slurry samples and three of four samples of digestate from biogas plants tested positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. In the vicinity of the pig barns these resistant bacteria were detected in 14/87 (16.1%) boot swabs taken from various ground surfaces and in 2/36 (6%) ambient air samples. Inside the pig barns, 6/63 (9.5%) barn air samples and a small proportion of flies and mice feces samples were ESBL/AmpC-positive. PFGE analysis proved fecal emission as well as a possible spread via flies, as identical ESBL-E. coli isolates were detected in slurry and on fertilized fields, as well as in flies and pooled feces from inside the barn and slurry. Contaminated slurry presented the major emission source for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in the pig fattening farms, but a spread via the airborne route or via different vectors also seems possible.","Institute for Animal Hygiene and Environmental Health, Free University Berlin, and Robert-von-Ostertag-Strasse 7-13, 14163 Berlin, Germany.

The abundances of 16S rRNA genes and six tetracycline resistance genes (tetB, tetH, tetZ, tetO, tetQ, and tetW) were also quantified using real-time PCR. Bacterial abundances, community composition and diversity all showed strong seasonal patterns defined by winter peaks in abundance and diversity. Microclimatic variables of SCBs, particularly air speed, PM2.5 and total suspended particles (TSP) were found significantly correlated to abundances, community composition, and diversity of bacterial bioaerosols. Seasonal fluctuations were also observed for four tetracycline resistance genes, tetH, tetO, tetQ, and tetW. The frequency of occurrences of these resistance genes were significantly higher in samples collected during winter and was also significantly correlated with air speed, PM2.5 and TSP. Overall, our results indicate that biotic contaminants in SCBs exhibit seasonal trends, and these could be associated with the microclimatic variables of SCBs.

DESIGN: We used Andersen two-stage samplers to collect bacterial samples, the replicate plate method to isolate organisms, and the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method to determine antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: The percentage of organisms resistant to at least two antibiotic classes and all four classes evaluated were, respectively, 2.1 and 3.0 times higher inside (n = 69) than upwind (n = 59) of the facility. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent organism recovered. Concentrations of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus decreased with increasing distance from the facility. Using Fisher's exact methods, the change in distribution of antibiotic resistance profiles for each antibiotic was statistically significant (oxytetracycline, p = 0.010; tetracycline, p = 0.014; ampicillin, p = 0.007; erythromycin, p = 0.035); however, this relationship was not seen with lincomycin and penicillin (p > 0.05). In addition, the levels of antibiotic-resistant S. aureas 25 in downwind were significantly greater than the levels from samples taken upwind from the facility for the same four antibiotics (p < 0.05). The percentage of resistant group A streptococci and fecal coliform increased within the facility compared with upwind values for all antibiotics evaluated, except for lincomycin. The percentage of resistant total coliform organisms increased within the facility compared with upwind values for oxytetracycline and tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial concentrations with multiple antibiotic resistances or multidrug resistance were recovered inside and outside to (at least) 150 in downwind of this facility at higher percentages than upwind. Bacterial concentrations with multiple antibiotic resistances were found within and downwind of the facility even after subtherapeutic antibiotics were discontinued. This could pose a potential human health effect for those who work within or live in close proximity to these facilities.","Gibbs, SG (Reprint Author), Univ Texas, Ctr Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, El Paso Reg Campus,1100 N Stanton,Suite 110, El Paso, TX 79902 USA.

Microbial air samples were collected from three different SCBs equipped with three different types of manure removal systems (deep-pit manure removal with slats, scraper removal system, and deep-litter bed system). The abundance and composition of airborne biotic contaminants of all the collected air samples were analyzed using cultivation-independent methods. The V1V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the extracted DNA and sequenced using 454-pyrosequencing. The abundances of 16S rRNA genes and six tetracycline resistance genes (tetB, tetH, tetZ, tetO, tetQ, and tetW) were quantified using real-time PCR. The abundance of 16S rRNA gene and tetracycline resistance genes were significantly higher in SCBs equipped with a deep-pit manure removal system with slats, except for tetB gene. This contrasts with the opposite trend found previously by culture-based studies. The aerial bacterial community composition, as measured by pairwise Bray-Curtis distances, varied significantly according to the manure removal system. 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing revealed Firmicutes (72.4 \%) as the dominant group with Lactobacillus as the major genus, while Actinobacteria constituted 10.7 \% of the detectable bacteria. Firmicutes were more abundant in SCBs with deep pit with slats, whereas Actinobacteria were highly abundant in SCBs with a deep-litter bed system. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the manure removal system plays a key role in structuring the abundance and composition of airborne biotic contaminants in SCBs.","Choi, HL (Reprint Author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Biotechnol, Seoul 151921, South Korea.

However, knowledge on transmission routes of MRSA in livestock production is still scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of MRSA in pig house air as well as in samples from pigs and their housing environment in 27 MRSA positive pig barns of different sizes and production types. In 85.2\% of all barns MRSA was detected in the animal house air. Impingement turned out to be a more sensitive sampling technique than filtration. Other environmental samples such as boot swabs or faeces showed prevalences of MRSA from 55.6\% to 85.2\% at sample level. The level of MRSA was 88.3\% for pooled and 82.1\% for single nasal swabs, in skin swabs the one was 87.7\%, the others was 78.7\%. Spa typing of isolates from air and nasal swabs showed predominantly spa types toll and t034. MRSA prevalences in pigs as well as in various environmental samples were significantly higher in fattening farms than in breeding farms.

Methods: Enterococcus isolates were recovered from a variety of samples (n = 82; swine, feed/medicines/antiseptics and pig farm facilities) from six Portuguese farms, most using antibiotics. Antimicrobial susceptibility/conjugation assays were performed by standard procedures, bacterial identification/screening of antibiotic resistance genes were performed by PCR and clonality was determined using PFGE/multilocus sequence typing. Results: Enterococcus isolates resistant to antibiotics (n = 473) were recovered from samples of different origin (swine, feed/antiseptics, animal residues and pig farm facilities), but only the clinically relevant species Enterococcus faecium (n = 171) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 78) were included for further comprehensive molecular analysis. Isolates resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, erythromycin and aminoglycosides were better recovered in Slanetz-Bartley medium with these antibiotics present than in media not supplemented with antibiotics (P < 0.05). E. faecium was more frequently resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or nitrofurantoin and E. faecalis to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol or aminoglycosides (P < 0.05). Glycopeptide and erythromycin resistance rates were similar in both species. The transfer of resistance to several antibiotics, including vancomycin and ampicillin, was demonstrated. Clones associated with human infections were detected in different samples from the same farm {[}E. faecium from sequence type (ST) 78 lineage and E. faecalis ST16; manure, waste lagoons, faeces and drinking water] and in geographically distant farms {[}E. faecium clonal complex (CC) 5; E. faecalis CC21 and ST16]. Conclusions: The pig farm environment has an underestimated potential role in the transmission of MDR Enterococcus to animals and, possibly, to humans. The continuous contact of swine with MDR Enterococcus by different routes (e. g. feed, dust, air and rooms) might decrease the impact of restrictive antibiotic use policies and reinforces the need for different and preliminary interventions at the husbandry management level.","Peixe, L (Reprint Author), Univ Porto, REQUIMTE, Microbiol Lab, Fac Farm, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.

Use of antibiotics in this manner has become the source of increasing controversy because overuse of antibiotics is suspected of leading to resistance in bacteria that cause human diseases. The purpose of this study was to measure airborne antibiotic concentrations in a swine production facility that routinely included antibiotics in feed. Samples were collected in a hog facility that included rooms devoted to farrowing, nursery, and growing operations. Analytical methods were developed to measure concentrations of the antibiotics tylosin and lincomycin in air samples. Tylosin was mixed in the feed in some of the rooms in the facility. While lincomycin was not added during this study, it had been used in this facility in the past and therefore was included in the analytical testing. Inhalable (n = 34), respirable (n = 37), and high-volume (n = 16) dust samples were collected on PVC filters over a two-month period. Tylosin concentrations were above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in 93% of the samples, while lincomycin concentrations were above the LOQ in only 9% of the samples (LOQ = 0.04 ng/sample). The average tylosin concentrations were 3, 18, and 49 ng/m3 in the respirable, inhalable, and high-volume samples, respectively. No occupational or environmental worker exposure criteria currently exist for antibiotics in air. The results of this study may be used to estimate potential swine production worker exposures and to further study the association between these exposures and health effects.","University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242, USA.",Murphy MW and Sanderson WT and Vargo JD,NA,1074-7583 (Print) and 1074-7583 (Linking),Journal of agricultural safety and health,NA,eng,357-66,pubmed,Airborne antibiotic concentrations in a swine feeding operation.,13,2007,1125,1,YES,N,N,N,N,Y,NO,NO,NO,NO,NA,none,,,,pig,514,Kraemer_2017_SCOFTHTOEN,"The presence of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in pig farms has been widely reported, and the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) has been documented in several countries.

To characterize animal and environmental routes of worker exposure, we optimized methods to identify S. aureus on operations that raise swine in confinement with antibiotics (industrial hog operation: IHO) versus on pasture without antibiotics (antibiotic-free hog operation: AFHO). We associated findings from tested swine and environmental samples with those from personal inhalable air samplers on worker surrogates at one IHO and three AFHOs in North Carolina using a new One Health approach. We determined swine S. aureus carriage status by collecting swab samples from multiple anatomical sites, and we determined environmental positivity for airborne bioaerosols with inhalable and impinger samplers and a single-stage impactor (ambient air) cross-sectionally. All samples were analyzed for S. aureus, and isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, absence of scn (livestock marker), and spa type. Seventeen of twenty (85\%) swine sampled at the one IHO carried S. aureus at > 1 anatomical sites compared to none of 30 (0\%) swine sampled at the three AFHOs. All S. aureus isolates recovered from IHO swine and air samples were scn negative and spa type t337; almost all isolates (62/63) were multidrug resistant. S. aureus was recovered from eight of 14 (67\%) ambient air and two (100\%) worker surrogate personal air samples at the one IHO, whereas no S. aureus isolates were recovered from 19 ambient and six personal air samples at the three AFHOs. Personal worker surrogate inhalable sample findings were consistent with both swine and ambient air data, indicating the potential for workplace exposure. IHO swine and the one IHO environment could be a source of potential pathogen exposure to workers, as supported by the detection of multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) with livestock-associated spa type t337 among swine, worker surrogate personal air samplers and environmental air samples at the one IHO but none of the three AFHOs sampled in this study. Concurrent sampling of swine, personal swine worker surrogate air, and ambient airborne dust demonstrated that IHO workers may be exposed through both direct (animal contact) and indirect (airborne) routes of transmission. Investigation of the effectiveness of contact and respiratory protections is warranted to prevent IHO worker exposure to multidrug-resistant livestock-associated S. aureus and other pathogens.","Davis, MF; Heaney, CD (Reprint Author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth \& Engn, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.

Aerosol samples were collected at multiple locations on the farm and in the house. Antibiotic resistance was investigated using the Kirby Bauer method on selected isolates using twelve different antibiotics spanning both narrow to broad spectrums of effectiveness. Overall there was a cyclical increase in bacterial concentrations as flocks progressed from pre-flock to late-flock, with >2 orders magnitude lower concentration during pre-flock periods (no chickens), in both the litter and aerosol samples. The house environment provided for significantly concentrated bacterial and endotoxin levels. It was estimated that Staphylococcus bacteria accounted for at least 90\% of cultured aerobic bacteria and culture-independent 165 rRNA analyses demonstrated that significant population changes occurred from pre- to late-flock. Rarely was an isolate resistant to more than 4 antibiotic classes; however there was a trend upwards in overall resistance of enterococci as the flock cycle progressed.

Isolates were obtained using air samplers and selective phenylethyl alcohol agar for gram-positive bacteria during 35-d periods at different times of the day. A total of 200 colonies were recovered and after basic biochemical tests were performed, presumptive staphylococci were subsequently identified by API Staph strips. A total of 153 (76.5\%) staphylococci were found, among which 84 were S. xylosus (46 and 38 isolated inside and outside, respectively). Biofilm formation was observed in 86.9\% of S. xylosus isolates, whereas 79.8\% of them showed hemolytic activity. There was a strong correlation (92.5\%) between biofilm formation and hemolytic activity. All 84 S. xylosus isolates were susceptible to amikacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin, nezolid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Resistance to nalidixic acid (86.9\%), novobiocin (85.7\%), penicillin (70.2\%), lincomycin (46.4\%), oxacillin (42.9\%), ampicillin (27.4\%), tetracycline (21.4\%), erythromycin (11.9\%), bacitracin (10.7\%), and streptomycin (2.4\%) was observed among the isolates. Resistance to tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromycin, and beta-lactam antibiotics was occasionally linked to the tetK, linA, ermB, and blaZ genes, respectively. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA results showed similarity of 15 to 99\% between isolates collected outside and inside the barn, indicating genetic diversity of these isolates.

Therefore, this study was designed to systematically investigate the occurrence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry, air (inside animal houses), ambient air (outside animal houses) and on soil surfaces in the areas surrounding of seven ESBL/AmpC-positive broiler chicken fattening farms, including investigation of the possible spread of these bacteria via the faecal route and/or exhaust air into the environment. Seven German broiler fattening farms were each investigated at three points in time (3-36 h after restocking, 14-18 and 26-35 days after housing) during one fattening period. The occurrence of ESBL/AmpC genes in the investigated samples was confirmed by PCR, detecting bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), bla(TEM) and bla(CMY)-genes, and, if necessary, by sequencing and/or the disc diffusion method. The results showed a wide spread of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in broiler farms, as well as emissions into the surroundings. 12 out of 14 (86\%) slurry samples were positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. Additionally, 28.8\% (n = 23/80) of boot swabs taken from various surfaces in the areas surrounding of the farms as well as 7.5\% (n = 3/40) of the exhaust air samples turned out to be positive for these microorganisms. Moreover, a small proportion of air samples from inside the barns were ESBL/AmpC-positive. By comparing selected isolates using pulsed field gel electrophoresis, we proved that faecal and airborne transfer of ESBL/AmpC-producing microorganisms from broiler fattening farms to the surrounding areas is possible. Two isolates from farm G2 (slurry and boot swab 50 m downwind), two isolates from farm G3 (slurry and individual animal swab) as well as two isolates from farm G6 (air sample in the barn and air sample 50 m downwind) showed 100\% similarity in PFGE analysis.

Bioinformatic analysis showed the effect of dust events on the diversity of the atmospheric microbiome. The relative abundance of desert soil-associated bacteria increased during dust events, while the relative abundance of anthropogenic-influenced taxa decreased. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of selected clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) showed that their relative abundance decreased during dust events. The ARG profiles on dust-free days were similar to those in aerosol collected in a poultry house, suggesting a strong agricultural influence on the local ambient profiles. We conclude that dust storms enrich the ambient airborne microbiome with new soil-derived bacteria that disappear as the dust settles, suggesting that the bacteria are transported attached to the dust particles.

Although bacterial abundance and diversity have been well studied, limited information on the size distribution of bioaerosols has prevented a clear understanding of the health effects of exposure to bioaerosols from CAFOs. Here, different sizes of particles were sampled from the inside and outside of atmospheric environments of layer and broiler feeding operations using 8-stage Andersen samplers. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 16S rDNA-based sequencing were used to analyze the characteristics of biological abundance and diversity, respectively, according to size. The results indicated that size-related differences occurred in terms of airborne bacterial richness, diversity, and concentration at poultry-feeding operations. The richness of biological genera in the urban atmospheric environment was lower than in concentrated poultry-feeding operations. The biological diversity of airborne bacterial genera, including genera associated with potential pathogens, varied according to size. The bacterial lineages of bioaerosols present in the 7 size stages for layers clustered apart from those for broilers, suggesting that the type of poultry house is a more important factor than the particle size in shaping the microbial communities. In most cases, the concentrations of the 16S rDNA, Escherichia coli, tetW, and tetL genes increased as the particle size increased, with the geometric mean diameters varying from 4.7 to 5.8 mu m. These results regarding the size-related differences in the diversity and abundance of bioaerosols will facilitate a better understanding of the potential health impact on both poultry and humans working in such environments.

RESULTS: Antimicrobial resistance was detected in 21.8% of the 78 E. coli isolates analyzed (resistance for at least one of the 14 agents tested). The highest resistance rates were recorded for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. The resistance genes detected were as follows (antibiotic (number of resistant strains), gene (number of strains)): ampicillin (9), blaTEM-1 (6); tetracycline (15), tet(A) (7), tet(B) (4), tet(A) + tet(B) (1); chloramphenicol (5), cmlA (2), floR (2); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (10), sul2 (4), sul1 (3), sul3 (2), sul1 + sul2 (1); gentamicin-tobramycin (1), ant(2) (1). About 14% of strains showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype and, of them, seven strains carried class 1 integrons containing predominantly the dfrA1-aadA1 array. One multidrug-resistant strain was found in both inside and outside air, suggesting that the airborne spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria from the animal housing facilities to the surroundings is feasible.

In this context, a study evaluated strategies to curb livestock-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA). Fifty-one veal calf farms were assigned to one of 3 study arms: RAB farms reducing antimicrobials by protocol; RAB-CD farms reducing antimicrobials by protocol and applying a cleaning and disinfection program; and Control farms without interventions. MRSA carriage was tested in week 0 and week 12 of 2 consecutive production cycles in farmers, family members and veal calves. Interventions were validated and a cyclic rise in MRSA-prevalence in animals was shown with a more moderate increase in RAB farms. Prevalence in humans declined parallel over time in the study arms but RAB farms were at the lowest MRSA levels from the beginning of the study. In RAB-CD farms, human and animal prevalence did not differ from Control farms and MRSA air loads were significantly higher than in the other study arms. Mimicking the national trend, an overall AMU decrease (daily dosages per animal per cycle (DDDA/C)) was observed over 4 pre-study and the 2 study cycles; this trend did not have a significant effect on a set of evaluated farm technical parameters.

In addition, the reliability and reproducibility of MRSA detection in nasal samples from veal calves were investigated as well as the additional value of rectal samples to establish MRSA status of an individual animal. On these three farms, MRSA prevalence and MRSA air loads in stables rapidly increased during the production cycle, especially after releasing calves from their individual houses, but not simultaneously with or directly after treatment with antimicrobials. These observations constitute the hypothesis that antimicrobial use may not necessarily be the only condition for MRSA transmission in veal calves, but indicate that other factors may contribute to transmission as well.

Modern industrial-scale animal feeding operations rely extensively on veterinary pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, to augment animal growth. Following excretion, antibiotics are transported through the environment via runoff, leaching, and land application of manure; however, airborne transport from feed yards has not been characterized. Objectives: The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), and ruminant-associated microbes are aerially dispersed via particulate matter (PM) derived from large-scale beef cattle feed yards. Methods: PM was collected downwind and upwind of 10 beef cattle feed yards. After extraction from PM, five veterinary anti-biotics were quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, ARG were quantified via targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and microbial community diversity was analyzed via 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. Results: Airborne PM derived from feed yards facilitated dispersal of several veterinary antibiotics, as well as microbial communities containing ARG. Concentrations of several antibiotics in airborne PM immediately downwind of feed yards ranged from 0.5 to 4.6 mu g/g of PM. Microbial communities of PM collected downwind of feed yards were enriched with ruminant-associated taxa and were distinct when compared to upwind PM assemblages. Furthermore, genes encoding resistance to tetracycline antibiotics were significantly more abundant in PM collected downwind of feed yards as compared to upwind. Conclusions: Wind-dispersed PM from feed yards harbors antibiotics, bacteria, and ARGs.","Smith, PN (Reprint Author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Environm Toxicol, Box 41163, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.

Bacterial and fungal aerosols in five different wastewater treatment plants in Poland were studied, including the pioneering antibiotic resistance testing of airborne bacteria. Concentration level was measured using the six-stage Andersen impactor. After incubation, bioaerosol particles captured on nutrient media on Petri dishes were quantitatively evaluated and qualitatively identified. It was found that the concentration levels of both airborne bacteria and fungi ranged from 10A(2) to 10A(3) colony-forming units/mA(3), in all stages of the wastewater treatment plants. The patterns of size distributions of airborne bacteria and fungi were very similar, showing dominant peaks typically in the size range between 3.3 and 4.7 mu m. The majority fraction of small bacterial and fungal particles (less than 4.7 mu m) in the studied areas indicates that the bioaerosol is relatively fresh, and mostly of local origin. The Gram-positive cocci and nonsporing Gram-positive rods were the dominating forms in the studied wastewater treatment plants environment. The existing differences in the concentration levels between sampling sites enabled identification of the main bioaerosol sources. The highest concentration of bacterial aerosol appeared in sections, where activated sludge post-processing and mechanical purifying are conducted. The most frequently occurring species in the sampled bacterial aerosol were Gram-positive cocci and nonsporing Gram-positive rods. Multi-antibiotic resistance testing showed that among the isolated airborne bacteria, the most antibiotic-resistant features were present among Bacillus species (especially Bacillus mycoides).","Kowalski, M (Reprint Author), Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Energy \& Environm Engn, Dept Air Protect, 22B Konarskiego St, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.

Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (GNOPB) were isolated, and antibiotic susceptibility tests against 18 commonly used antibiotics, including 11 -lactam antibiotics, 3 aminoglycosides, 2 fluoroquinolones, 1 furan and 1 sulfonamide, were conducted. More than 45% of airborne bacteria isolated from the pharmaceutical WWTP were resistant to three or more antibiotics, and some opportunistic pathogenic strains were resistant to 16 antibiotics, whereas 45.3% and 50.3% of the strains isolated from residential community and municipal WWTP showed resistance to three or more antibiotics. The calculation of the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index demonstrated that the air environment in the pharmaceutical WWTP was highly impacted by antibiotic resistance, while the residential community and municipal WWTP was less impacted by antibiotic resistance. In addition, we determined that the dominant genera of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria isolated from all bioaerosol samples were Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas.

Accordingly, it seems particularly interesting to trace the fate of these bacteria and their genes encoding antibiotic resistance in both untreated sewage from hospitals, and in sewage after different stages of purification, and finally to examine the degree of their emissions to environment. Although wastewater treatment processes reduce number of bacteria in sewage up to 99\%, in the presented study it was reported that more than 2.7 x 10(3) CFU/mL E. coli reached the receiving water and contributed to dissemination of resistant bacteria into the environment.

Among the detectable ARGs, tetracycline, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance genes had the highest abundance, and smog and soil had similar composition characteristics of ARGs. During the smog event, the total abundance of airborne ARGs ranged from 4.90 to 38.07 ppm in PM2.5 samples, and from 7.61 to 38.49 ppm in PM10 samples, which were 1.6-7.7 times and 2.1-5.1 times of those in the non-smog day, respectively. The airborne ARGs showed complicated co-occurrence patterns, which were heavily influenced by the interaction of bacterial community, and physicochemical and meteorological factors. Lactobacillus and sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 were determined as keystones in the co-occurrence network of microbial taxa and airborne ARGs.

At station P, where airborne bacterial composition was evaluated as a mean value of 20 repeated experiments, there were 42% Gram-positive cocci, 37% Gram-positive rods, 3.5% Bacillus strains and 5.5% Gram-negative rods. Fluctuating values of cell amounts for Gram-positive cocci and rods during these experiments suggested that in the atmospheric layer near the ground, the former was a more transient group of airborne bacteria than the latter. When airborne bacterial flora over the experimental area was surveyed by observations at six stations, the dispersion profile of bacterial flora closely corresponded to vegetating states on the surface of the ground. Over vegetating areas, airborne bacterial flora appeared in about equal amounts of Gram-positive rods and cocci, while over bare ground, Gram-positive rods appeared more abundantly than Gram-positive cocci. To investigate the distribution of drug-resistant strains among airborne bacteria, sensitivity tests to six antibiotics were carried out with S. xylosus strains isolated at stations P and E.

By constructing sequence similarity networks from uncultured environmental samples, we show that microbial gene pool distributions are not influenced nearly as much by geography as ecology, thus extending the Bass Becking hypothesis from whole organisms to microbial genes. We find that gene pools are shaped by their broad ecological niche (such as sea water, fresh water, host, and airborne). We find that freshwater habitats act as a gene exchange bridge between otherwise disconnected habitats. Finally, certain antibiotic resistance genes deviate from the general trend of habitat specificity by exhibiting a high degree of cross-habitat mobility. The strong cross-habitat mobility of antibiotic resistance genes is a cause for concern and provides a paradigmatic example of the rate by which genes colonize new habitats when new selective forces emerge.","McInerney, JO (Reprint Author), Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Biol, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.

We examined the seasonal variations in airborne bacteria and several ARGs in PM2.5 across an industrial urban rural transect in a megacity of China over an annual cycle. Seasonality was most apparent at the rural site with a remarkable wintertime reduction in the total level of bacteria and an enrichment of certain ARGs in winter but dilution in spring. This contrasted with the relative consistency across seasons at urban and industrial sites. The statistical correlation between ARGs and the mobile genetic element (MGE), intI1, weakened from rural to urban and industrial sites, which hints at the diluting role of intI1 in horizontal gene transfers across the land use gradient. Differing mechanisms may regulate site-specific population exposure to transferable ARGs, and the identification of additional MGEs is warranted. Compared to drinking water and the accidental ingestion of agricultural soil, airborne PM2.5 contributes to a similar extent to the human daily intake of certain ARGs and intI1.

The purpose of this study was to understand the distribution pattern of bioaerosols during an annual trade fair in the historical city of Gwalior, central India, a very important historical fair that was started by the King of Gwalior Maharaja Madho Rao in 1905. METHODS: Air samples were collected from six different sites at the fair ground and three different sites in a residential area before/during/after the fair using an impactor sampler on microbial content test agar and rose bengal agar for total bacteria and fungi, respectively. The representative strains of bacteria and fungi were further identified and selected bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing according to US Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The bacterial bioaerosol count [colony-forming units (CFU)/m(3)] at fair sites was found to be 9.0 x 10(3), 4.0 x 10(4), and 1.0 x 10(4) before the start of the fair, during the fair, and after the fair, respectively. The fungal bioaerosol count at fair sites was 2.6 x 10(3) CFU/m(3), 6.3 x 10(3) CFU/m(3), and 1.7 x 10(3) CFU/m(3) before the fair, during the fair, and after the fair, respectively. Bacterial/fungal bioaerosols during-fair were increased significantly from the bacterial/fungal bioaerosols of the before-fair period (p < 0.05); they were also significantly higher than the bacterial/fungal bioaerosols at non-fair sites during the event (p < 0.0001). The proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria over the fair ground was significantly increased during-fair and was still higher in the after-fair period. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) were also reported at the fair ground. CONCLUSION: The study indicates significantly higher bacterial and fungal bioaerosols during the fair event. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the health aspects and guidelines to control microbial load during such types of events.","Department of Biotechnology, Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior and 474005, India. and School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India. and Department of Biotechnology, Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior and 474005, India. and Biotechnology Division, Defense Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior and 474002, India. and Department of Biotechnology, Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior and 474005, India. and School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India. and National Agri-Food Biotechnology Institute, Mohali 160071, India. and School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India; and Biotechnology Division, Defense Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior and 474002, India.

Environments where selection and transmission of antibiotic resistance frequently take place are likely to be characterized by high abundance and diversity of horizontally transferable ARGs. Large-scale quantitative data on ARGs is, however, lacking for most types of environments, including humans and animals, as is data on resistance genes to potential co-selective agents, such as biocides and metals. This paucity prevents efficient identification of risk environments. Results: We provide a comprehensive characterization of resistance genes, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial taxonomic compositions for 864 metagenomes from humans (n = 350), animals (n = 145) and external environments (n = 369), all deeply sequenced using Illumina technology. Environment types showed clear differences in both resistance profiles and bacterial community compositions. Human and animal microbial communities were characterized by limited taxonomic diversity and low abundance and diversity of biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs but a relatively high abundance of ARGs. In contrast, external environments showed consistently high taxonomic diversity which in turn was linked to high diversity of both biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs. Water, sediment and soil generally carried low relative abundance and few varieties of known ARGs, whereas wastewater/sludge was on par with the human gut. The environments with the largest relative abundance and/or diversity of ARGs, including genes encoding resistance to last resort antibiotics, were those subjected to industrial antibiotic pollution and a limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event. Conclusions: Our study identifies air and antibiotic-polluted environments as under-investigated transmission routes and reservoirs for antibiotic resistance. The high taxonomic and genetic diversity of external environments supports the hypothesis that these also form vast sources of unknown resistance genes, with potential to be transferred to pathogens in the future.","Larsson, DGJ (Reprint Author), Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Biomed, Dept Infect Dis, SE-41346 Gothenburg, Sweden.

DESIGN: We used Andersen two-stage samplers to collect bioaerosol samples from 24 houses in El Paso, Texas, using tryptic soy agar as the collection media, followed by the replicate plate method on Chapman Stone selective medium to isolate S. aureus. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to determine antibiotic resistance to ampicillin, penicillin, and cefaclor, which represent two distinct classes of antibiotics. RESULTS: The average recovered concentration of respirable heterotrophic organisms found outside each home was 345.38 CFU/m(3), with an average of 12.63 CFU/m(3) for S. aureus. The average recovered concentration of respirable heterotrophic organisms found inside each home was 460.23 CFU/m(3), with an average of 15.39 CFU/m3 for S. aureus. The respirable S. aureus recovered from inside each home had an average resistance of 54.59\% to ampicillin and 60.46\%. to penicillin. Presence of cefaclor-resistant and of multidrug-resistant S. aureus was the same, averaging 13.20\% per house. The respirable S. aureus recovered from outside each home had an average resistance of 34.42\% to ampicillin and 41.81\% to penicillin. Presence of cefaclor-resistant and of multidrug-resistant S. aureus was the same, averaging 13.96\% per house. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that antibiotic-resistant bioaerosols are commonly found within residential homes. Our results also suggest that resistant strains of airborne culturable S. aureus are present in higher concentrations inside the study homes than outside the homes.","Gibbs, SG (Reprint Author), Univ Texas, Ctr Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, 1100 N Stanton,Suite 110, El Paso, TX 79902 USA.

The effects of season, temperature, relative humidity, air change rate (ACR), other bacterial genera, area per occupant, and presence of S. aureus-positive occupants were studied. In samples from 67 living rooms, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. epidermidis, and S. capitis were found in 13-25\%; S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii, and S. pasteuri in 5-10\%; and S. lugdunensis, S. haemolyticus, S. caprae, S. equorum, S. kloosii, S. pettenkoferi, S. simulans, and S. xylosus in less than 3\%. Staphylococcus aureus were found in two of 67 living rooms: spa type t034 (an MRSA) was recovered from a farmhouse, while spa type t509 was found in an urban home. Two species, S. equorum and S. kloosii, were found only in the farmhouse. Staphylococcus was significantly associated with season with lowest concentration and richness in winter. Genera composition was associated with ACR with smaller fractions of Staphylococcus at higher ACR, while richness was significantly and negatively associated with area per occupant. Concentration of Staphylococcus correlated positively with the total concentration of bacteria, but negatively with the total concentration of other bacteria. The concentration of Staphylococcus was not significantly associated with concentrations of the other abundant genera Bacillus, Kocuria, and Micrococcus. In offices with S. aureus-positive occupants, airborne S. aureus was not found. In conclusion, Staphylococcus species constitute a considerable proportion of the airborne bacteria in the studied homes and offices. However, both S. aureus and MRSA had very low prevalence during all seasons. Thus, transmission of S. aureus and MRSA through the air in living rooms in Copenhagen is expected to be limited. The negative associations between ACR and the fraction Staphylococcus constituted out of total bacteria, and between area per occupant and Staphylococcus richness indicate that it might be possible to affect the presence of airborne Staphylococcus in homes.","Madsen, AM (Reprint Author), Natl Res Ctr Working Environm, Lerso Pk Alle 105, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.

The disk-diffusion tests showed that the collected isolates were most frequently resistant to erythromycin. The PCR technique was employed to search for genes conferring the resistance in staphylococci to antibiotics from the group of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins. The analyzed Staphylococcus isolates possessed simultaneously 4 different resistance genes. The molecular analysis with the use of specific primers allowed to determine the most prevalent gene which is mphC, responsible for the resistance to macrolides and for the enzymatic inactivation of the drug by phosphotransferase. The second most often detected gene was msrA1, which confers the resistance of staphylococci to macrolides and is responsible for active pumping of antimicrobial particles out of bacterial cells.  2017, The Author(s).","Department of Microbiology, University of Agriculture, Mickiewicza Ave. 24/28, Krakw, Poland; Faculty of Biotechnology and Horticulture, University of Agriculture, 29 Listopada Ave 54, Krakw, Poland; Centre for Microbiological Research and Autovaccines, Sawkowska 17, Krakw, Poland","Lenart-Boro, A. and Wolny-Koadka, K. and Juraszek, K. and Kasprowicz, A.",10.1007/s10453-017-9481-7,3935965,Aerobiologia,"erythromycin;  lincosamide;  macrolide;  phosphotransferase;  streptogramin derivative, air sampling;  airborne bacterium;  ambient air;  antibiotic resistance;  Article;  bacterial gene;  bacterium identification;  bacterium isolation;  controlled study;  disk diffusion;  enzyme activation;  gene identification;  mphC gene;  msrA1 gene;  nonhuman;  phenotype;  polymerase chain reaction;  priority journal;  Staphylococcus;  Staphylococcus hominis;  Staphylococcus warneri",English,435-444,scopus,Phenotypic and molecular assessment of antimicrobial resistance profile of airborne Staphylococcus spp. isolated from flats in Krakw,33,2017,554,3,YES,Y,N,N,N,N,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES/gene,none,,,,multiple,578,Ling_2013_ENSC..TE,"Genes encoding tetracycline resistance and the integrase of Class 1 integrons were enumerated using quantitative PCR from aerosols collected from indoor and outdoor environments. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and human-occupied indoor environments (two clinics and a homeless shelter) were found to be a source of airborne tet(X) and tet(W) genes. The CAFOs had 10- to 100-times higher concentrations of airborne 16S rRNA, tet(X), and tet(W) genes than other environments sampled, and increased concentrations of aerosolized bacteria correlated with increased concentrations of airborne resistance genes. The two CAFOs studied had statistically similar concentrations of resistance genes in their aerosol samples, even though antibiotic use was markedly different between the two operations Additionally, tet(W) genes were recovered in outdoor air within 2 km of livestock operations, which suggests that antibiotic resistance genes may be transported via aerosols on local scales. The integrase gene (intI1) from Class 1 integrons, which has been associated with multidrug resistance, was detected in CAFOs but not in human occupied indoor environments, suggesting that CAFO aerosols could serve as a reservoir of multidrug resistance.

Five hundred and sixteen B. cinerea isolates were collected from infected berries or trapped from the air in the vineyards, and profiles of sensitivity to benomyl, fenhexamid, fluazinam, fludioxonil, iprodione and pyrimethanil were established for each of the isolates based on a mycelial growth test. Seventy-four percent of the isolates were sensitive to the six tested fungicides, and the other 26\% of the isolates were classified into 10 phenotypes characterized by resistance to one or more fungicides. Resistant isolates showed fitness parameters similar or reduced in comparison to sensitive isolates. Resistance to benzimidazoles and to dicarboximides was the most frequent (up to 25\%) and apparently pre-existed in the populations tested. Increased frequency of benzimidazole resistance, but not dicarboximide resistance, was observed following the 3 years of applications of the fungicides. High level resistance to pyrimethanil was present at a frequency of about 2\% in both vineyards in the first 2 years of the sampling survey and reached 10\% in the third year at Site 2. A few isolates were resistant to fenhexamid or fludioxonil (0.8 or 0.2\%, respectively).

Among the ESBL-determining genes, only blaTEM and blaCTXM-9 were detectedblaTEM was mostly found in KJK Szary (53.40% of strains), while the second detected geneblaCTXM-9was most frequent in SKH Nielepice (6.06% of strains). The rep-PCR genotyping showed high variation among the analyzed strains, whereas its degree differed between the studied facilities, indicating that the type of horse keeping (stable vs. free-range) affects the genetic diversity of the E. coli strains. Having regard to the fact that the tested strains of E. coli were derived from non-hospitalized horses that were not treated pharmacologically, we can assume that the observed antimicrobial resistance may be of bothnatural origin, i.e., not the result of the selection pressure, and acquired, the source of which could be people present in the horse riding facilities, the remaining horses which were not included in the study, and air, as well as water, fodder, and litter of the animals. Therefore, it can be concluded that the studied horses are the source of resistant E. coli and it is reasonable to continue monitoring the changes in antimicrobial resistance in those bacteria.  2018, The Author(s).","Department of Microbiology, University of Agriculture in Cracow, Mickiewicza Ave 24/28, Cracow, Poland","Wolny-Koadka, K. and Lenart-Boro, A.",10.1007/s11356-018-2274-x,9441344,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,Animalia;  Equidae;  Escherichia coli,English,21789-21800,scopus,Antimicrobial resistance and the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes in Escherichia coli isolated from the environment of horse riding centers,25,2018,1041,3,YES,N,Y,N,N,N,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES/gene,none,,,,horse,1042,Wolny.Koadka_2018_JoofEqVeSc,"The purpose of the study was to identify species, to determine the drug resistance profile, and to evaluate the occurrence of genes responsible for the development of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus bacteria isolated from the environment of horse riding centers. Staphylococci were isolated from air, manure, and nostrils of horses located in three horse riding centers, differing in horse stabling systembox stall stabling (OJK Pegaz and KJK Szary) and free-range stabling (SKH Nielepice). The dominant species was Staphylococcus vitulinus. A large variation in the frequency of occurrence of individual species between horse riding centers was determined. Resistance to antibiotics was determined by means of disc diffusion method and polymerase chain reaction technique to detect mecA genes responsible for methicillin resistance. In total, 408 strains were collected, most from SKH Nielepice, and least from OJK Pegaz. The highest resistance was found to gentamicin and tetracycline. Multidrug-resistant isolates were also detected in KJK Szary (10), in SKH Nielepice (5), and in OJK Pegaz (4). Methicillin resistance determined by disk diffusion assay was found in 23 strains, while the mecA gene was detected in 142 isolates. A total of 137 strains holding the mecA gene are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), which, as shown by our own studies, may be a reservoir of methicillin resistance. Most commonly, the mecA gene was found in staphylococci isolated in KJK Szary (61.70%). The mecA gene was detected in five strains that belonged to Staphylococcus aureus species and came from horses in SKH Nielepice, indicating the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in these animals.  2017 Elsevier Inc.","Department of Microbiology, University of Agriculture in Cracow, Cracow, Poland","Wolny-Koadka, K.",10.1016/j.jevs.2017.11.010,7370806,Journal of Equine Veterinary Science,"gentamicin;  tetracycline, air;  Article;  bacterial gene;  bacterium identification;  bacterium isolate;  bacterium isolation;  controlled study;  disk diffusion;  horse;  horseback riding;  manure;  mecA gene;  nonhuman;  nose;  penicillin resistance;  polymerase chain reaction;  Staphylococcus;  Staphylococcus arlettae;  Staphylococcus aureus;  Staphylococcus capitis;  Staphylococcus chromogenes;  Staphylococcus cohnii;  Staphylococcus delphini;  Staphylococcus equorum;  Staphylococcus felis;  Staphylococcus fleurettii;  Staphylococcus haemolyticus;  Staphylococcus hominis;  Staphylococcus hyicus;  Staphylococcus lentus;  Staphylococcus muscae;  Staphylococcus saprophyticus;  Staphylococcus sciuri;  Staphylococcus simulans;  Staphylococcus succinus;  Staphylococcus vitulinus;  Staphylococcus warneri;  Staphylococcus xylosus",English,65-71,scopus,Resistance to Antibiotics and the Occurrence of Genes Responsible for the Development of Methicillin Resistance in Staphylococcus Bacteria Isolated From the Environment of Horse Riding Centers,61,2018,1042,2,YES,Y,N,N,N,N,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES/gene,none,,,,hospital,317,Gao_2018_JOOFHAMA,"Clinically relevant antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bioaerosols have become a greater threat to public health.

Thus, five nosocomial bioaerosols were collected, and the dominant microbial and pathogenic microorganisms were identified by high-throughput sequencing in this study. The results suggested that the dominant microorganisms at the genus level were Massilia, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Methylophilus, Micrococcineae, and Corynebacterineae. The most abundant pathogenic microorganisms were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coil, Arcobacter butzleri, Aeromonas veronii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. The relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors was evaluated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Meanwhile, differences in the pathogenic bacteria between bioaerosols and dust in a typical hospital was investigated. Furthermore, cultivable Staphylococcus isolates with multi-drug resistance phenotype (> 3 antibiotics) in the inpatient departments were much higher than those in the transfusion area and out-patient departments, possibly attributed to the dense usage of antibiotics in inpatient departments.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antifungal susceptibilities of A. fumigatus isolates recovered from air and clinical samples collected in a French University hospital (Lyon), which underwent major deconstruction works over a one year-period. Methods: A daily surveillance of fungal contamination was implemented during 11-months. Environmental survey was realized by air samplings, outdoor and indoor, with an automatic agar sampler. In parallel, surveillance of IA infection cases was conducted by epidemiological investigation. Environmental and clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were identified by conventional methods and -tubulin sequencing. Susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus isolates against Itraconazole (ITZ), Voriconazole (VCZ) was performed using Etest method. Results: A total of 3885 air samples (1744 outdoor samples and 2141 indoor samples) were collected. From the 3073 identified colonies of A. fumigatus, 400 A. fumigatus isolates were tested for their susceptibility to ITZ and VCZ, including 388 isolates coming from the environment (indoor n:157, outdoor n:231) and 12 isolates coming from clinical samples. All the 400 isolates were susceptible to azoles ( 1 g/mL). Conclusions: No environmental reservoir of A. fumigatus azole resistant strains was found in our hospital which was undergoing major demolition works.

MATERIALS/METHODS: We performed a multicentre, internal-crossover study comparing bacterial contamination levels in washrooms with hand-drying by either paper towels (PT) or jet air dryer (JAD, Dyson). 120 sampling sessions occurred over 12 weeks in each of 3 hospitals (UK/France/Italy). Bacteria were cultured from air, multiple surfaces and dust. Washroom footfall (patients/visitors/staff) was monitored externally. RESULTS: Footfall was nine times higher in UK washrooms. Bacterial contamination was lower in PT vs JAD washrooms; contamination was similar in France/UK, but markedly lower in Italy washrooms. Total bacterial recovery was significantly greater from JAD versus PT dispenser surfaces at all sites (median 100-300vs0-10 CFU; all p<0.0001). In UK/France, significantly more bacteria were recovered from JAD washroom floors (median 24vs191 CFU, p<0.00001). UK MSSA recovery was 3x more frequent and 6-fold higher for JADs vs PTs surfaces (both p<0.0001). UK MRSA recovery was 3x more frequent (21vs7 CFU) from JAD versus PT surfaces or floors. Significantly more enterococci and ESBL-producing bacteria were recovered from UK JAD versus PT washroom floors (p<0.0001). In France, ESBL-producing bacteria were recovered from dust twice as often during JAD versus PT use. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple examples of significant differences in surface bacterial contamination, including by faecal and antibiotic resistant bacteria, were observed, with higher levels in JAD versus PT washrooms.

All samples were tested by the GB 4789.40-2010 to isolate Enterobacter sakazakii, the ompA virulence genes were detected to identify Enterobacter sakazakii by PCR; four virulence genes (sip, hly, cpa and ompX) were examined by PCR; antimicrobial susceptibility were tested by using agar dilution methods. Results: In total 29 samples of the 14 ested locations out of 27 were positive for Enterobacter sakazakii. The detection rate and the contamination rate was 51.9% and 16.1%, respectively. Positive samples mainly concentrate in the powder samples (23.5%) and swabs samples (16.9%). The rate of virulence gene was 100%. The detection rates of virulence genotypes carrying cpa-ompX and cpa-hly-ompX were 79.3% and 20.7%, respectively.

Currently, selection pressure caused by azole fungicide use in farming is strongly suspected of creating resistance. As sawmills also use azole fungicides, we investigated the presence of azole-resistant strains in this environment and studied the relationship between azole fungicide use and development of resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Air (n = 200) and substrate (n = 600) samples were taken in 20 sawmills. Azole-resistant strains (Etest and EUCAST methods) were confirmed by sequencing the cyp51A gene and its promoters. Dosage of propiconazole and tebuconazole was performed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Twenty-four azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains were collected among 20 of the 600 substrate samples (3%). Eighty-three percent of theses strains had TR34 /L98H mutation. A significantly higher number of resistant strains was collected in sawmills using fungicide products made with propiconazole mixed with a high concentration of tebuconazole (P = 0.009). The presence of resistant strains was significantly linked to propiconazole quantities in substrates (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of azole-resistant A. fumigatus carrying TR34 /L98H mutation seems to greatly depend on the azole fungicide formulation and quantities of azole. These preliminary results are valuable to propose new approaches limiting the emergence of azole-resistant strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Azole resistance is an emerging problem in A. fumigatus and threatens clinical advances made possible by the use of azole antifungals in the treatment of Aspergillus-related diseases. Azole fungicides are also used in the wood industry, notably in sawmills, to protect wood from wood-destroying fungi. Through our study, we show that sawmills represent another professional environment affected by the presence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains carrying the TR34 /L98H mutation. Moreover, this study provides valuable preliminary results to propose some new approaches to limit the emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains.","Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital, Besancon, France. and Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital, Besancon, France. and Chrono-Environnement UMR 6249 CNRS, Bourgogne Franche-Comte University, Besancon, and France. and Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital, Besancon, France. and Chrono-Environnement UMR 6249 CNRS, Bourgogne Franche-Comte University, Besancon, and France. and Chrono-Environnement UMR 6249 CNRS, Bourgogne Franche-Comte University, Besancon, and France. and Chrono-Environnement UMR 6249 CNRS, Bourgogne Franche-Comte University, Besancon, and France. and Parasitology-Mycology Department, University Hospital, Besancon, France. and Chrono-Environnement UMR 6249 CNRS, Bourgogne Franche-Comte University, Besancon, and France.",Jeanvoine A and Rocchi S and Reboux G and Crini N and Crini G and Millon L,10.1111/jam.13488,1365-2672 (Electronic) and 1364-5072 (Linking),Journal of applied microbiology,Aspergillus infection and TR34/L98H mutation and azole fungicides and environmental mycology and resistance,eng,NA,pubmed,Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in sawmills of Eastern France.,NA,2017,1250,1,YES,N,N,Y,N,N,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,none,,,,wetmarket,313,Gao_2016_SCOFTHTOEN,"Chinese wet markets with live poultry trade have been considered as major sources of pathogen dissemination, and sites for horizontal transfer of bacterial and viral pathogens.

We report the occurrence of antibiotic resistant strains isolated from the working setting of a solid waste recycling plant in Italy which serves 195 municipalities. Methods: To assess microbial contamination levels, several sampling points were chosen for their relevance in evaluating exposure of the workers to biological risk, especially during indoor operations. Active sampling was carried out using the Surface Air System and Rodac plate method was applied to surface sampling. Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained by Vitek2 System (bioMrieux, France) and by the agar-diffusion method. The presence of resistance genes was investigated by multiplex PCR assay. Results: In all sampling points a significant contamination of aerosol was detected, although the total microbial counts resulted within the limit proposed by the National authority (10000 CFU/sqm). The counts of Enterobacteriaceae were always above the limit of 100 CFU/sqm and strains of Enterobacter cloacae resistant to beta-lactams and third generation cephalosporines, were detected, carrying the blaCTX-M15 gene.

The aim of this study was to detect and characterize potentially pathogenic viable microorganisms in bioaerosols in a pristine area. Samples were collected from the air, at three remote lakes in the Chilean Patagonia, using a sterile filtration system equipped with 0.2-mu m-pore-size nitrocellulose filters. The bacterial community present in bioaerosols was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Isolates were identified and characterized for phenotypic and 16S rDNA analysis and antibiotic resistance. SEM observations of samples from each lake showed the presence of bacteria with different morphologies, and after culturing, the identification results revealed that they were strains of Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Edwarsiella, Pseudomonas, Burklolderia, Moraxella, Sphingomonas and CDC NO-1. CDC NO-1, uncommonly isolated worldwide, stands out from the rest of the isolates because it is a rarely found bacterium so far associated with dog and cat bites and was found at two out of three pristine lakes studied (Alto and Verde).

It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally, astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized. Methods: This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species-and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared. Results: Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. Conclusion: Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments.","Venkateswaran, K (Reprint Author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Biotechnol \& Planetary Protect Grp, M-S 89-2,4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Airborne virus like particles have been isolated from Grana Padano and Gorgonzola PDO cheese production plants and ripening cellars. A shotgun metagenomics analysis of the isolated viromes highlighted a high complexity of the viral communities both in terms of viral taxonomy and phage-host associations. Bacterial reads in each of the viromes were confirmed to be abundant and their taxonomy appeared to be associated to the environmental parameters and the technological processes that characterize the sampling area. Antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in each virome thus confirming that phages could be involved in the mobilization of antimicrobial resistances among bacterial populations. Interestingly human viruses were also identified even if the contamination source was not revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental conditions, which are imposed by the technology of the dairy process, seams to shape the viral populations as a consequence of the adaptation of microbial taxa to those environments. The identification of sequences belonging to Legionella pneumophila and to the human papillomavirus, raised some considerations about the safety of cheese ripening cellars. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In conclusion, the analysis of the dairy airborne viromes, has revealed a high complexity of the viral communities even if the environments where the samples were collected were confined environments. Metagenomics of airborne viral population could be a promising monitoring tool for the biological characterization of dairy environments. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aimed to characterize and compare the microbial air quality of air-conditioned (AC) and naturally ventilated (NV) office rooms in the Upper Silesia region of Poland. The bacterial samples were collected during the late spring season. Culturable bacteria were deposited on the nutrient media on Petri dishes to investigate the viable-culturable count (VCC) of bacteria and bacterial community structure using a Biolog GEN III system. In total, 12 species of bacteria were identified, with the most isolated Macrococcus equipercicus, Micrococcus luteus D, Staphylococcus xylosus (indoor), and Bacillus species (outdoor). The indoor mean concentrations of bacterial aerosol ranged from 10(2) to 10(3) CFU m(-3), below Polish proposals for threshold limit standards in office buildings. The indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios indicated that studied air pollutants in the office rooms originated from the indoor air. These results, together with community composition of bacteria, indicate that most of the bacteria present in the studied office building were relatively fresh and of human origin. Multi-antibiotic resistance (MAR) tests showed that the most antibiotic-resistant features were present in Macrococcus species. The office building exposure dose (OBED) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of bacteria aerosol were estimated. The highest value of OBED over the study period was obtained for staff working in offices with natural ventilation (141 CFU kg(-1)), in contrast to the value for staff working in offices equipped with air conditioning (about 100 CFU kg(-1)). The MMAD of viable airborne bacteria was higher in AC offices (2.4 mu m) than in NV offices (2.2 mu m).","Bragoszewska, E (Reprint Author), Silesian Tech Univ, Dept Air Protect, 22B Konarskiego St, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.

This problem applies mainly to public areas where we spend a large part of our lives. This study was focused on the microbiological analysis of the air in some kindergartens and antibiotic resistance of bacteria of the Stephylococcus spp. genus. The identification of the isolated mould fungi has been also made. Material and Methods: Air samples were collected from classrooms in the seasonal cycle in the mornings and afternoons using 2 methods, sedimentation and impact. Air samples collected outside the kindergartens served as controls. Air quality assessments were based on the groups of indicator microorganisms, according to Polish standards. The susceptibility of isolated staphylococci was assessed with the disc-diffusion method, using 8 different classes of antibiotics, in line with the recommendations of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Results: The analyses show that, regardless of the method, the total number of heterothropic bacteria and staphylococci in the air of the analyzed kindergartens exceeded the allowable limits. There was no air pollution with the fungal infection. Based on the antibiogram, it was found that Staphylococcus spp. strains showed the highest sensitivity to chloramphenicol and the lowest to penicillin and gentamicin. Among the fungi moulds of the genus Cladosporium predominated. Conclusions: The results of the analyses highlight the need for regular health checks and further research to help identify biological factors that may significantly affect the quality of health of people living in public spaces.

Methods: Air samples were taken using an Andersen impactor in 32 rooms designed for children stay. The concentrations of airborne bacteria were calculated as colony forming units (CFU) (growing on trypticase soy agar) per cubic meter of air (CFU/m(3)). The compositions of bioaerosol were determined on blood trypticase soy agar and Haemophilus selective agar. Isolated strains were identified using API NH strips and apiweb software. The antibiotic resistance of H influenzae strains was determined by the disk diffusion method. Results: Compared with the proposed criteria for microbiologic quality of indoor air, the rooms were characterized by the very high bacterial contamination of the air. The prevailing component of bacterial aerosol was gram-positive cocci. Airborne H influenzae strains were found in 25\% of the investigated rooms and were mostly classified as biotype II (33\%). Conclusion: It may be accepted that the exposure to airborne H influenzae is typical of child day care centers in contrast to indoor environments with older population. Child day care center contribute to the expansion of H influenzae in human population via air. Generally, airborne H influenzae isolates from the investigated child day care centers were susceptible to older antibiotics such as ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
