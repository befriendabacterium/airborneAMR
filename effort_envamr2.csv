Risk factors for the spread of resistant bacteria in hospitals and the community can be summarised as overcrowding, lapses in hygiene or poor infection control practices. Increasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria has been exacerbated by the slow pace in developing newer antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus arureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria are spread primarily by direct or indirect person-to-person contact. Independent risk factors for MRSA include the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, the presence of decubitus ulcers and prosthetic devices while those for VRE include prolonged hospitalisation and treatment with glycopeptides or broad spectrum antibiotics. For the spread of resistant Gram-negative bacteria risk factors include urinary catheterisation, excessive use of antibiotics and contamination of humidifiers and nebulisers. The spread of penicillin-resistant pneumococci (PRP) and drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTb) is due to airborne transmission. Risk factors for the spread of PRP include overcrowding, tracheostomies and excessive use of penicillins for viral respiratory infections; for MDRTb they include poor compliance, convergence of immunosuppressed patients, delayed diagnosis or treatment, and poor or inadequate ventilation and isolation facilities. Recent developments in the genomic mapping of many bacteria and advances in combinatorial chemistry promise to usher in a new era of antibiotic development. While this may result in our regaining some of the ground lost to resistant bacteria, there will still be a continuing need to minimise the spread of antibiotic resistance through the rational use of antibiotic agents and stringent infection control practice."

Specifically, there is a lack of information regarding nasal colonization with S. aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Latin America and Peru. Methods: This is the report of the baseline findings of a prospective cohort study followed up over 1 year at four geographically and ecologically distinct Peruvian Air Force bases in order to determine S. aureus nasal colonization prevalence and risk factors. Additionally, all MRSA isolates underwent molecular analysis which included pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and determination of virulence and resistance genes. Results: We enrolled 756 military personnel. Anterior nares colonization with Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 73 of 756 participants (9.7 %) and MRSA was detected in 2 of 756 (0.3 %). Colonization rates differed significantly (P = 0.02) between geographic enrollment sites: Talara-4.3 %, Iquitos-9.1 %, Arequipa-14.0 % and Lima-11.3 %. Risk factors for S. aureus colonization included being male and a reported history of respiratory disease. Conclusion: Overall, we found low prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA nasal colonization in this Peruvian military population. These findings contribute to the overall epidemiological understanding of S. aureus and MRSA in Latin America. The colonization rates which varied based on geographical location warrants further study.  2016 The Author(s)."

However, there is a lack of data regarding the microbial quality of reclaimed water. In particular, no previous studies have evaluated the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in reclaimed water used at spray irrigation sites in the United States. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the occurrence, concentration, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of VRE and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci at three U.S. spray irrigation sites that use reclaimed water. We collected 48 reclaimed water samples from one Mid-Atlantic and two Midwest spray irrigation sites, as well as their respective wastewater treatment plants, in 2009 and 2010. Samples were analyzed for total enterococci and VRE using standard membrane filtration. Isolates were purified and then confirmed using biochemical tests and PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using the Sensititre microbroth dilution system. Data were analyzed by two-sample proportion tests and one-way analysis of variance. We detected total enterococci and VRE in 71\% (34/48) and 4\% (2/48) of reclaimed water samples, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis was the most common species identified. At the Mid-Atlantic spray irrigation site, UV radiation decreased total enterococci to undetectable levels; however, subsequent storage in an. open-air pond at this site resulted in increased concentrations of enterococci. E. faecalis isolates recovered from the Mid-Atlantic spray irrigation site expressed intrinsic resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin; however, non-E. faecalis isolates expressed resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin (52\% of isolates), vancomycin (4\%), tetracycline (13\%), penicillin (4\%) and ciprofloxacin (17\%). Our findings show that VRE are present in low numbers in reclaimed water at point-of-use at the sampled spray irrigation sites; however, resistance to other antimicrobial classes is more prevalent, particularly among non-E. faecalis isolates.

Although several antimicrobial agents are currently recommended for the treatment and prevention of M. gallisepticum infections, investigations of M. gallisepticum have been hampered by their fastidious growth requirements and slow growth rate. As such, little work has been conducted concerning the PK/PD relationship and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance between antimicrobials against M. gallisepticum. In the present study, danofloxacin was orally administrated to the infected chickens once daily for 3 days by an established in vivo M. gallisepticum infection model. Not only the concentrations of danofloxacin in plasma and lung tissues were analyzed, but also the counting of viable cells and changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in air sac and lung were determined. The PK and PD data were fitted by WinNonlin to evaluate the PK/PD interactions of danofloxacin against M. gallisepticum. PCR amplification of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and DNA sequencing were performed to identify point mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE of the selected resistant mutant strains. In addition, susceptibility of enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and norfloxacin against these mutant strains were also determined. The PK profiles indicated that danofloxacin concentration in the lung tissues was higher than plasma. Mycoplasmacidal activity was achieved when infected chickens were exposed to danofloxacin at the dose group above 2.5 mg/kg. The ratios of AUC24/MIC (the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h divided by the MIC) for 2 log10 (CFU) and 3 log10 (CFU) reduction were 31.97 and 97.98 L h/kg, respectively. Substitutions of Ser-83-->Arg or Glu-87-->Gly in gyrA; Glu-84-->Lys in parC were observed in the resistant mutant strains that were selected from the dose group of 1 and 2.5 mg/kg. MICs of danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and norfloxacin against the resistant mutant strains with a single mutation in position-83 were higher than that with a single mutation in position-87. These findings suggested that danofloxacin may be therapeutically effective to treat M. gallisepticum infection in chickens if administered at a dosage of 5.5 mg/kg once daily for 3 days."

One E. coli with pMG252 plasmid containing bla(FOX5) and qnrA1 genes and another E. coli with pMG298 plasmid containing bla(CTX-M15) and qnrB1 genes were first orally inoculated to chickens Both isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. The birds were then experimentally infected with an avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), via the air sac. Treatments (oxytetracycline (OTC), trimethoprim-sulfadimethoxin (SXT), amoxicillin (AMX) or enrofloxacin (ENR) were then offered at the therapeutic doses. Symptoms, lesions in dead or sacrificed birds, and isolation and characterization of APEC from internal organs were studied. Results showed that OTC, SXT or ENR treatments could control the pathology. AMX worsened the disease, possibly due to endotoxin shock. All APEC re-isolated from internal organs showed the same antimicrobial susceptibility as the APEC inoculated strain, except for one APEC isolate from an infected OTC-treated bird, which acquired tetracycline resistance only, and one APEC isolate recovered from the air sacs of a chicken in the infected SXT-treated group, which acquired the pMG252 plasmid and became multi-resistant. Thus three antimicrobials could control the disease but the experimental model enabled, to our knowledge, the first observation of plasmid transfer from a bacterium of the intestinal tract to a pathogenic isolate from the respiratory tract."

The dispersion of the nano ATP colloidal particles, the morphology, microstructure, thermal stability, ultraviolet resistance, antibacterial activity and air permeability of the treated cotton fabric were characterized. The results showed that the particle size of the ATP particle distributed between 100 nm to 150 nm after dispersion. The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectra) analysis demonstrated that the ATP particles were successfully introduced to surface of the cotton fabric. The structural and thermal stability of the treated fabric were higher than those of the untreated fabric. The ATP treated cotton fabric possessed excellent ultraviolet resistance and antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the treatment did not affect the wear ability of the cotton fabric. The multifunctional cotton fabric meets the market demand for natural products."

At present it is unknown whether the risk for respiratory disease (BRD) or neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in the veal herd is associated with total immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or on the serostatus for respiratory pathogens measured at arrival. Therefore, the first objective of this prospective longitudinal cohort study was to determine associations between serum protein fractions as determined by routine electrophoresis (total protein, albumin, alpha-1 and -2 globulins, beta-globulins and Ig's) at arrival and BRD and NCD in the first 3 weeks of the production cycle. The second objective was to determine whether the serostatus (seropositive/seronegative) of seven respiratory pathogens (bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenzavirus-3, bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis) of these arrival serum samples could be associated with the risk of having BRD. The third objective was to determine which of the electrophoresis proteins and respiratory serostatuses were associated with average daily gain (ADG) in the study period. The study population consisted of 150 rose veal calves housed in a single air-space. The study period ended at day 18 post arrival, when BRD incidence was judged to be too high to further postpone a group treatment. A Cox regression model was used to determine the effect of the studied protein fractions and antibodies on the time to BRD and NCD occurrence. The effect of the studied predictors on ADG was determined by linear regression. Calves with Ig levels under 7.5 g/L had an increased BRD hazard (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.9 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.0)). NCD was only positively associated with the alpha-2 globulin concentration. Calves with a negative serostatus for BCV (HR = 1.7 (95\% CI = 1.0-2.8)) or BRSV (HR = 2.0 (95\% CI = 1.0-3.9)) had an increased BRD hazard. Average daily gain (ADG) was 0.242 kg/day (SD = 0.142) and was not related to the occurrence of BRD or NCD. Calves with Ig's below 7.5 g/L and with increased levels of alpha-2 globulins showed a decrease in ADG. This study showed the importance of providing sufficient colostrum to veal calves and the potential benefit of the presence of BCV and BRSV antibodies at arrival to reduce the BRD hazard in the first 3 weeks.

One strategy for drug discovery is to inhibit an essential metabolic enzyme. The seventh step of the de novo purine-biosynthesis pathway converts carboxyaminoimidazoleribonucleotide (CAIR) and L-aspartic acid (Asp) to 4-(N-succino)-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (SAICAR) in the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) using the enzyme PurC. PurC has been shown to be conditionally essential for bacterial replication. Two crystal structures of this essential enzyme from Streptococcus pneumoniae (spPurC) in the presence of adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), Mg2+, aminoimidazoleribonucleotide (AIR) and/or Asp have been obtained. This is the first structural study of spPurC, as well as the first of PurC from any species with Asp in the active site. Based on these findings, two model structures are proposed for the active site with all of the essential ligands (ATP, Mg2+, Asp and CAIR) present, and a relay mechanism for the formation of the product SAICAR is suggested."

The aim of this study was to assess whether acute moderate hypoxia modulates the expression of CYP2B4, 2C5, and 2C16 in vivo, and to determine whether the changes in hepatic P450 are conveyed by serum mediators. Moreover, because hypoxia increases the expression of P-glycoprotein in vitro, we examined whether in vivo acute moderate hypoxia modulates the expression of several membrane transporters in the liver. Rabbits and rats were exposed to a fractional concentration of oxygen of 8\% for 48 h to generate a stable arterial partial pressure of O-2 of 34 +/- 1 mm Hg. Compared with rabbits breathing room air, hypoxia in rabbits reduced the amount of CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B4, 2C5, and 2C16 proteins and increased the expression of CYP3A6. Sera of rabbits with hypoxia were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography, the fractions were tested for their ability to modify the expression of P450 isoforms, and serum mediators were identified through neutralization experiments. The serum mediators responsible for the down-regulation of P450 isoforms were interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-2. In vivo, in rats, hypoxia increased the mRNA and protein expression of P-glycoprotein but did not affect the mRNA of breast cancer resistance protein and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2. It is concluded that in vivo, hypoxia down-regulates rabbit hepatic CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B4, 2C5, and 2C16 and up-regulates CYP3A6.

The occurrence of these variants depended upon the partial pressure of oxygen and the inoculum size. Subculture of dwarf or giant colonies produced a mixture of both colony types after incubation in hyperbaric oxygen, and colonies of normal appearance after incubation in air. Electron micrographs of ultrathin sections showed that cells from dwarf colonies had a more clearly defined envelope region than cells from normal colonies. Giant colony and normal colony-derived cells were of similar appearance. Whole cells from giant colonies contained more carbohydrate, readily extractable lipid, neutral lipid and free fatty acid than cells from normal colonies; the two cell types showed similar contents of 2-keto,3-deoxyoctonic acid and total phospholipid, but different proportions of individual phospholipids. Cells from dwarf, giant and normal (air-grown) colonies were incubated in air on nutrient agar containing either polymyxin, tetracycline or phenoxyethanol. Relative to cells from normal colonies, cells from dwarf colonies showed enhanced resistance to all three agents and cells from giant colonies showed enhanced resistance to polymyxin and tetracycline only. The resistance of cells from variant colonies was lost following a single subculture in air in the absence of antibacterial agents. It was concluded that the envelopes of cells from dwarf and giant colonies differed both from each other and from those of normal cells. These differences, and the formation of variant colonies, appeared to result from bacterial adaptation to hyperbaric oxygen rather than from mutation."

Many ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein ( P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 ( MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP) are highly expressed in bronchial epithelium. This review aims to give new insights in the possible functions of ABC molecules in the lung in view of their expression in different cell types. Furthermore, their role in protection against noxious compounds, e. g. air pollutants and cigarette smoke components, will be discussed as well as the ( mal) function in normal and pathological lung. Several pulmonary drugs are substrates for ABC transporters and therefore, the delivery of these drugs to the site of action may be highly dependent on the presence and activity of many ABC transporters in several cell types. Three ABC transporters are known to play an important role in lung functioning. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) gene can cause cystic fibrosis, and mutations in ABCA1 and ABCA3 are responsible for respectively Tangier disease and fatal surfactant deficiency. The role of altered function of ABC transporters in highly prevalent pulmonary diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) have hardly been investigated so far. We especially focused on polymorphisms, knock-out mice models and in vitro results of pulmonary research. Insight in the function of ABC transporters in the lung may open new ways to facilitate treatment of lung diseases."

In this Review I examine the evidence put forward to support these recommendations and assess whether such an approach is justifiable. A systematic review identified 39 studies of which 13 were included. The majority of studies found no evidence of transmission. Only two studies reported reliable evidence of transmission. The analysis suggests that there is reason to doubt the value of actively screening air passengers for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and that the resources used might be better spent addressing other priorities for the control of tuberculosis."

This causes patient distress and is costly to treat. A range of precautions is undertaken at the time of surgery to reduce infection, with varying levels of supporting evidence. This study aimed to determine how frequently and consistently infection prevention precautions are used during breast implant surgery. Methods: Multicenter observational study of surgical practice with real-time data collection during breast implant surgery. Results: From 7 NHS breast units, 121 implant procedures were assessed in 94 patients under the care of 22 consultant surgeons. The commonest procedure was immediate reconstruction (58%; 70/121). All patients were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (but not methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) screened. Antibiotics were given at surgery in all cases; 92% (85/94) received postoperative antibiotics. Other precautions included closed glove technique (67%; 63/94), door signs to reduce theater traffic (72%; 68/94), glove changing prior to implant handling (98%; 119/121), laminar air flow theaters (55%; 52/94), disposable drapes (94%; 88/94) and gowns (74%; 70/94), and cavity washing (89%; 108/121). Among the 14 consultants evaluated on more than 1 procedure (range, 2-22; median = 5), only 1 consistently used exactly the same precautions when siting an implant. Conclusion: Despite national guidance, infection prevention measures are not applied consistently during breast implant surgery, with variability between surgeons and within individual surgeon's practice. The introduction of an infection prevention checklist for all breast implant procedures could improve the reliability with which these precautions are undertaken."

Although L. brevis is ubiquitous in the environment, due to its antibiotic resistance, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the extent of the risk of horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria in the environment. Six studies with laboratory-scale silos were made using forage of differing water-soluble carbohydrate content. Replicate silos containing forages treated at the proposed application rate were compared to identical silos containing the same but untreated forage. After opening and exposure to air, an increase of 3 degrees C over ambient was taken to indicate aerobic deterioration. The additive showed a potential to significantly improve the aerobic stability of silage produced from easy, moderately difficult and difficult to ensile forage at a minimum application rate of 1 x 10(8) CFU/kg plant material.

To retard bacterial colonization, we have recently reported on the modification of bone allografts with the antibiotic vancomycin (VAN). In this report, we examine the ability of this antibiotic-modified allograft to resist bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. When antibiotic was coupled to the allograft, a uniform distribution of the antibiotic was apparent. Following challenges with Staphylococcus aureus for 6 h, the covalently bonded VAN decreased colonization as a function of inoculum, ranging from 0.8 to 2.0 log(10) CFU. Furthermore, the VAN-modified surface resisted biofilm formation, even in topographical niches that provide a protected environment for bacterial adhesion. Attachment of the antibiotic to the allograft surface was robust, and the bonded VAN was stable whether incubated in aqueous media or in air, maintaining levels of 75 to 100% of initial levels over 60 days. While the VAN-modified allograft inhibited the Gram-positive S. aureus colonization, in keeping with VAN's spectrum of activity, the VAN-modified allograft was readily colonized by the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Finally, initial toxicity measures indicated that the VAN-modified allograft did not influence osteoblast colonization or viability. Since the covalently tethered antibiotic is stable, is active, retains its specificity, and does not exhibit toxicity, it is concluded that this modified allograft holds great promise for decreasing bone graft-associated infections."

Fifteen patients with involvement by Trichosporon were identified: 5 were infected, 5 were possibly infected, and 5 were colonized but not infected by Trichosporon. Four of the infected patients had trichosporonemia and/or positive skin biopsy cultures as the first evidence of infection. The fifth infected patient had positive marrow and skin biopsy cultures. Serial surveillance cultures of infected patients showed preceding Trichosporon colonization in only 1 of 5 cases. Pulmonary infiltrates in 3 infected patients correlated at postmortem examination with Trichosporon pneumonia. Renal dysfunction marked by proteinuria, hematuria, red blood cell casts and azotemia correlated with widespread glomerular infiltration with the fungus. The five infected patients died of their infection, whereas the 2 possibly infected patients who died succumbed to their underlying illness. Trichosporonemia may have been averted in possibly infected patients because of a shorter median duration of profound (less than 100/microliter) neutropenia (5 days) when compared to that of infected patients (20 days).

On examination he was afebrile, tachycardic and had decreased lower left lung air entry accompanied by crackling. A chest x-ray revealed left-sided basal pneumonia with a para-pneumonic effusion. Blood tests were unremarkable. The athlete was treated with oral antibiotics, and was advised to stop exercise completely for eight weeks. He made a full recovery and completed further Ironman races within a year. CONCLUSION: The case highlights that clinicians treating elite endurance athletes must exclude severe infection, even when the clinical signs are few or absent. The reason is that if these athletes continue to train, serious complications could ensue due to their compromised resistance to infection."

However, in 2003 California reported the largest number of cases in the nation, and over the past decade the proportion of cases with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has not decreased. Objective To describe the magnitude, trends, geographic distribution, clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of MDR-TB cases reported to the California registry of Reports of Verified Cases of TB. Design, Setting, and Cases Analysis of 38 291 TB cases reported from all 61 local health jurisdictions in California during 1994-2003. Multidrug-resistant TB was defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Main Outcome Measures Results of univariate and multivariable analyses of MDR-TB magnitude, trends, geographic distribution, clinical characteristics, associated factors, and outcomes. Results Of 38 291 reported TB cases, 28 712 (75\%) were tested for resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin; of these, 407 MDR-TB cases (1.4\%) were reported from 38 of 61 California health jurisdictions (62\%); the proportion of MDR-TB cases did not significantly change over the study period (P=.87). Cases of MDR-TB were twice as likely to have cavitary lesions compared with non-MDR-TB cases (P<.001) and were 7 times more likely to have reported previous treatment for TB (P<.001). Of MDR-TB cases with outcomes, 231 (67\%) completed therapy, and those with MDR-TB were significantly less likely to complete therapy than those without MDR-TB (P<.001). Multivariate analysis identified previous TB diagnosis, positive acid-fast bacilli sputum smear results, Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity, time in the United States less than 5 years at the time of diagnosis, and outcomes of ``died{''} and ``moved{''} as factors associated with MDR-TB. Conclusions Multidrug-resistant TB, an airborne disease with limited, costly treatment options, persists in 1\% to 2 \% of all cases despite California's control efforts. Local and global TB control efforts are needed to prevent the further development and spread of MDR-TB."

We investigated this proposed pathogenesis by infecting mice with airborne encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) and then challenging them 1, 4, and 7 days later with aerosols of Neisseria meningitidis. Meningococcal clearance was assessed by comparing the numbers of bacteria present immediately after inhaling the aerosols with the numbers present 3 hr later. To insure that EMC virus adequately depressed murine defense mechanisms, we also determined staphylococcal killing rates at 4 hr by using radiophosphorus-labeled staphylococcal aerosols. Viral infection depressed murine pulmonary antimeningococcal activity at 1 and 4 days (P < 0.01) but not at 7 days. Intrapulmonary staphylococcal killing was impaired on day 4 (P < 0.01) but not on days 1 or 7. Pulmonary viral titers decreased rapidly from 10(7) to 10(3) plaque-forming units/ml of lung during the experimental period. According to these data viral disease transiently depresses resistance to meningococcal infection.

At the beginning of the assay, specimens of human carcinomas are disaggregated to dense single cell suspensions and dropped on a filter sheet at the air-medium interface. Organoid culture nodules develop within several days to weeks. They are exposed to cytostatics by adding the drugs for 2-3 days to the growth medium below the filter sheet. At the end of the exposure period, the cytotoxic effects are estimated by determining the fraction of viable cells, measured by the uptake of neutral red in relation to the total cell mass.

Escherichia coli gains antibiotic resistances by expressing genes involved in a global response to DNA damage. Therefore, we asked whether A. baumannii does the same through a yet undetermined DNA damage response akin to the E. coli paradigm. We found that recA and all of the multiple error-prone DNA polymerase V (Pol V) genes, those organized as umuDC operons and unlinked, are induced upon DNA damage in a RecA-mediated fashion. Consequently, we found that the frequency of rifampin-resistant (Rif) mutants is dramatically increased upon UV treatment, alkylation damage, and desiccation, also in a RecA-mediated manner. However, in the recA insertion knockout strain, in which we could measure the recA transcript, we found that recA was induced by DNA damage, while uvrA and one of the unlinked umuC genes were somewhat derepressed in the absence of DNA damage. Thus, the mechanism regulating the A. baumannii DNA damage response is likely different from that in E. coli. Notably, it appears that the number of DNA Pol V genes may directly contribute to desiccation-induced mutagenesis. Sequences of the rpoB gene from desiccation-induced Rif mutants showed a signature that was consistent with E. coli DNA polymerase V-generated base-pair substitutions and that matched that of sequenced A. baumannii clinical Rif isolates. These data strongly support an A. baumannii DNA damage-inducible response that directly contributes to antibiotic resistance acquisition, particularly in hospitals where A. baumannii desiccates and tenaciously survives on equipment and surfaces."

Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and referral Hospital, Ethiopia from December 1/2015 to April 30/2015. The Air samples were collected from delivery room, intensive care unit and operation theatre of the hospital by active, Anderson six slate sampler technique during the first week of the months, twice a week during Monday's and Friday's. Standard microbiological procedures were followed to isolate P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Susceptibility testing was performed on isolates using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique. Extended spectrum beta lactamase production was detected by double disc synergy test and Imipenem-resistant isolates were screened for producing Metallo-beta lactamase. Results: A total number of 216 indoor air samples were collected from the delivery room, intensive care unit, and operation room. Correspondingly, 43 A. baumannii isolates were identified (13 from delivery room, 21 from intensive care unit and 9 from operation room).

Extended spectrum beta lactamase and metalo-beta lactamase production were observed in 24 (55.8\%) and 13 (30.2\%) isolates of A. baumannii respectively, whereas P. aeruginosa showed 15 (62.5\%) extended spectrum beta lactamase and 9 (37.5\%) metallo-beta lactamase production. Conclusions: Extended spectrum beta lactamase and metallo-beta lactamase producing bacteria in hospital air is a new dimension for specific setting of the study area where antimicrobial resistance is increasing and surgical site infection is prevalent. So, identification of these microorganisms has a great role in reducing the burden of antibiotic resistance and could also provide a significant input for framing hospital infection control policies."

Changing epidemiology, increasing resistance rates and a narrow antifungal armamentarium may further underline the required attention on resistance particularly within the most prevalent invasive fungal infections caused by Candida yeasts and Aspergillus moulds. In Denmark, the resistance epidemiology remains to be fully elucidated. This thesis sought to address this demand as well as provide insight into the landscape of underlying molecular resistance mechanisms. Paper I and II both contributed to the understanding of FKS (beta-glucan synthase) mediated echinocandin resistance in Candida species. Paper I covered a unique stepwise acquisition of a homozygous mutation in FKS1 of Candida tropicalis leading to an amino acid change corresponding to a well-known S645P in Candida albicans. Paper II presented a failure case due to Candida krusei displaying high-level echinocandin resistance likely attributable to an acquired D662Y amino acid substitution in FKS1. Intrinsic differences in FKS1 among Candida species may explain why the level of resistance both depends on the mutation as well as the species and cannot be easily translated to the level of clinical resistance. Intrinsic fluconazole resistance in C. krusei further substantiated the clinical implications of acquired echinocandin resistance. Paper III presented a rare multidrug resistance case in a series of isogenic C. albicans isolates, almost covering the entire spectrum of known resistance mechanisms in Candida and involved the proposal of novel resistance mutations. An A61E change in ERG11 was potentially involved in reduced susceptibility to long-structured azoles. Increased expression levels of azole efflux pumps were probably accredited to novel gain-of-function variants in the transcription factor TAC1 (R688Q and R673L). Echinocandin resistance was induced by the well-known S645P variant of FKS1 and polyene resistance was likely inflicted by a frameshift mutation in ERG2 leading to loss of function of the encoded protein and subsequent ergosterol depletion. The number of acquired resistance cases is increasing in our settings and Paper IV sought to illuminate whether antifungal resistance is overlooked in the current fungaemia programme. This involved the acquisition of post-treatment oral isolates from 193 Candidaemia patients among which 114 received azoles (primarily fluconazole) and 85 received an echinocandin (and some both). Azole exposed patients carried a significantly higher proportion of species less susceptible to fluconazole (primarily Candida glabrata) among colonising Candida compared to baseline blood isolates (P<0.001). A similar trend was seen for echinocandin treated patients although not statistically significant. Interestingly, there was a high frequency of acquired resistance, 29.4\% to fluconazole and 21.6\% to echinocandins, among colonising C. glabrata isolates post treatment. These figures were both significantly higher compared to baseline blood isolates as well as oral isolates from patients with no or minimal exposure to either drug class. In contrast, acquired resistance among C. albicans oral isolates was rare (<5\%). Thus, the oral cavity may be an unrecognized reservoir of resistant Candida species, especially C. glabrata following azole or echinocandin treatment. This underlines the care of which therapeutic stewardship must be taken both for antifungal naive patients, to avoid resistance development, as well as for patients previously exposed to antifungals. Paper VI was a retrospective laboratory based study and aimed to elucidate the prevalence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus isolates from 2010-2014 in Denmark. This study also sought to uncover the underlying resistance mechanisms, primarily attributable to CYP51A mutations, and finally to assess the accumulated genotyping data. Among 1162 A. fumigatus isolates, 94.5\% were screened for azole resistance and a significant increasing trend was observed for the number of azole resistant isolates to approximately 6\% in 2014 (P<0.001) and 4\% in corresponding patients (P<0.05). The underlying resistance mutations were diverse but still dominated by the TR34/L98H resistance mechanism responsible for >50\% of all our azole resistant isolates. The genotyping data of resistant and a selection of susceptible A. fumigatus showed high identity to foreign isolates (>15\%). This could argue for the hypothesis on clonal expansion, which has previously been suggested for TR34/L98H clones in the Netherlands and India, but could also indicate an insufficient discriminatory power of such analysis. Still, a proposed A. fumigatus outbreak in a haematology ward was unresolved since no genetically identical isolates were recovered from patients and air samples, illustrating the ubiquitous nature of this organism. Overall, the main concerns are a changing Candida epidemiology towards species less susceptible to fluconazole combined with the rapid acquisition of echinocandin resistance, especially among C. glabrata isolates. For A. fumigatus, the concern is the emergence of azole resistant strains in the environment, displaying cross-resistance to clinical azoles, and thus posing unforeseen clinical challenges in the management of invasive aspergillosis. Collectively, these findings call for an increased awareness especially at clinical microbiology laboratories, which ideally would lead to susceptibility testing of all clinically relevant isolates by reference or validated methods. Moreover, novel diagnostic approaches for non-culturable pathogens are warranted and especially DNA based detection by PCR may serve as a solid complimentary tool for improved diagnostics of invasive fungal infections."

A number of forces have resulted in the increased incidence of TB in developed countries, including the HIV epidemic, homelessness, and emigration from highly endemic regions. Although the number of new cases in Canada is relatively constant, the TB experience in the United States serves as a reminder that this situation could change rapidly. The appearance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has added to the urgency of situation. The basic methods of preventing TB transmission include preventing the release of the organism into the air, removing the organism from the air, and preventing the inhalation of the organism. Identifying and appropriately treating every person with active tuberculosis is an extremely important component of the control strategy; adequate ventilation, filtering air, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation are methods used to remove the organism from the air; and masks and other personal protective devices, such as high-efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA), have been suggested as a means of preventing inhalation of the organism. In addition, identifying new TB infections and using chemoprophylaxis often prevents infection from progressing to active disease. Given the route by which tuberculosis is transmitted, it is necessary for both dentists and allied dental personnel to be aware of the risks they may face in day-to-day practice, and the means by which they can protect themselves and their patients."

In this study, a total of 954 food samples originating from raw meat, cooked meat products, seafood, and vegetables purchased from supermarkets and open-air markets in Henan province, China, were analyzed for the presence of L. monocytogenes. All L monocytogenes isolates were subjected to serotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antimicrobial resistance. The overall percentage of L monocytogenes prevalence was 6.2\% (n = 59) with the highest rate of 7.4\% for cooked meat products followed by raw meat (6.7\%). The isolates belonged to five serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 4b, and 4c), with serotype 1/2a being predominant (55.9\%). PFGE revealed a low genetic diversity among the isolates, irrespective of their sources, suggesting that dominant clones are widespread in different food products in Henan. Resistance to cefotaxime (30.5\%) and ciprofloxacin (13.5\%) was most often, whereas resistance to tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin was observed less frequently. The presence of L. monocytogenes in food products and antimicrobial resistance among the isolates represents a potential public health risk. Our results indicate that effective hygienic measures and bacteriological controls are necessary in China to reduce the contamination of retail food samples by L. monocytogenes.

Low levels of antibiotic create a selective pressure toward antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in chicken fecal bacteria. The objective of this study was to compare bacteria and AMR genes in bioaerosols from CH and FH poultry facilities. Bioaerosols were collected from 15 CH and 15 FH poultry operations, using stationary area samplers as well as personal sampling devices. Bacteria concentrations were determined by genus- or species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AMR genes were detected using endpoint PCR. Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus spp. were significantly higher in bioaerosols of FH poultry operations than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.001) while Clostridium perfringens was significantly higher in area bioaerosols of CH operations than FH area bioaerosols (P < 0.05). Campylobacter spp. were detected only in bioaerosols of FH facilities. Zinc bacitracin resistance gene, bcrR, erythromycin resistance gene, ermA, and tetracycline resistance gene, tetA/C, were more prevalent in bioaerosols of FH facilities than CH bioaerosols (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, and P < 0.05, respectively).

Current treatment options for epithelial ovarian cancer are limited and therapeutic development for recurrent and drug-resistant ovarian cancer is an urgent agenda. We investigated the potential use of genetically engineered Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) to treat ovarian cancer patients who fail to respond to available therapies. Specifically, we examined the toxicity to hosts and specificity of targeting ovarian tumors using a Wv ovarian tumor model. Methods. We first tested recombinant VSV for oncolytic activity in a panel Of human ovarian epithelial cancer, immortalized, and primary ovarian surface epithelial cells in Culture. Then, we tested VSV oncolytic therapy using the immune competent Wv mice that develop tubular adenomas, benign turner lesions derived from Ovarian Surface epithelial cells. Results. The expression of GFP encoded by the recombinant VSV genome was detected in about 5\% of primary ovarian surface epithelial cells (3 lines) up to 30 days Without Significantly altering the growth pattern of the cells, suggesting the lack of toxicity to the normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. However, VSV-GFP was detected in the majority (around 90\%) of cells that are either ``immortalized{''} by SV40 antigen expression or cancer lines. Some variation in killing time courses was observed, but all the transformed cell lines were killed within 3 days. We found that regardless of the inoculation route (intra bursal, IP, or IV), VSV specifically infected and replicated in the in situ ovarian tumors in the Wv mice without significant activity in any other organs and tissues, and showed no detectable toxicity. The epithelial tumor lesions were greatly reduced in VSV-targeted ovarian tumors in the Wv mice. Conclusions. VSV oncolytic activity depends oil a cell autonomous property distinguishing primary and transformed cells. The efficient oncolytic activity of VSV for the ``immortalized{''} non-tumorigenic ovarian surface epithelial cells suggests that the selective specificity extends front pre-neoplastic to overt cancer cells.

Most indoor environments are connected to the natural environment by high ventilation, but some habitats are more confined: intensive care units, operating rooms, cleanrooms and the international space station (ISS) are extraordinary living and working areas for humans, with a limited exchange with the environment. The purposes for confinement are different: a patient has to be protected from infections (intensive care unit, operating room), product quality has to be assured (cleanrooms), or confinement is necessary due to extreme, health threatening outer conditions, as on the ISS. The ISS represents the most secluded man-made habitat, constantly inhabited by humans since November 2000 - and, inevitably, also by microorganisms. All of these man-made confined habitats need to be microbiologically monitored and controlled, by e.g., microbial cleaning and disinfection. However, these measures apply constant selective pressures, which support microbes with resistance capacities against antibiotics or chemical and physical stresses and thus facilitate the rise of survival specialists and multi-resistant strains. In this article, we summarize the available data on the microbiome of aforementioned confined habitats. By comparing the different operating, maintenance and monitoring procedures as well as microbial communities therein, we emphasize the importance to properly understand the effects of confinement on the microbial diversity, the possible risks represented by some of these microorganisms and by the evolution of (antibiotic) resistances in such environments - and the need to reassess the current hygiene standards."

Within the Firmicutes genera, Clostridium spp. were more abundant in the hog farm, whereas Staphylococcus spp. were higher in the spray field. The presence of opportunitic pathogens, including several Staphylococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes, was detected in both bioaerosol communities based on phylogenetic analysis. The isolation and identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from air samples also showed similar results with dominance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in both hog farm and spray field air.

The hypothiocyanite ion (OSCN-), product of the lactoperoxidase/H2O2/SCN- system of central airways, is emerging as an important molecule for innate defense mechanism against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Here we demonstrated that OSCN(-) displays virucidal activity in vitro against the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus. The concentration required to inhibit viral replication by 50% was 2 muM when virus were challenged directly with OSCN- before cell inoculation. These values were even lower when inoculated cells were maintained in contact with enzyme free-OSCN- in the culture medium. The last experimental conditions better reflect those of tracheobronchial mucosa, where HOSCN/OSCN- is retained in the air-liquid interface and inactivates both the viruses approaching the epithelium from outside and those released from the inoculated cells after the replication cycle. Importantly no OSCN- cytotoxicity was observed in the cellular system employed. The lack of toxicity in humans and the absence of damage on surfaces of fomites suggest a potential use of OSCN- to avoid mucosal and environmental transmission of influenza virus. Since hypothiocyanite is normally present in human airways a low risk of viral resistance is envisaged. In vivo confirmatory studies are needed to evaluate the appropriate dose, regimen and formulation."

While these bacilli usually lie latent without causing further disease, some 10% start foci of adult type disease usually starting in the sub-apical regions of the lungs. Bacilli multiply, killing tissue by caseation and then forming colonies within the caseum. Cavities form connecting to the air in whose walls vigorous bacillary multiplication occurs. The history of the development of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy is described, starting with the use of multi-drug regimens to prevent the emergence of drug resistance and continuing with the shortening of the treatment period to 6 months by the incorporation in the regimens of rifampicin and pyrazinamide, which are the two drug responsible for bactericidal activity during treatment. Prospects for further shortening of treatment rest with the introduction of higher dosage with rifamycins and with new anti-tuberculosis drugs. These new drugs include the 8 methoxyfluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin which inhibit topoisomerases and protein formation, the diarylquinoline TM-207 which inhibits the mycobacterial ATP synthase and thus energy formation, the nitroimidazopyran PA-824 and the closely related OPC-676832 which are pro-drugs with uncertain modes of action and the pyrrole SQ-109, a cell wall inhibitor. Anti-tuberculosis drugs have widely variable pharmacokinetic characteristics but as they work efficiently together, it is unnecessary to match these when giving drug combinations. The effects of drug-drug interactions are usually small though the interactions with anti-retroviral drugs can pose problems. Dose sizes have usually been chosen to minimize side effects while retaining activity and thus tend to have low therapeutic margins, the exception being the margin of about 20 for isoniazid. The role of high plasma binding, important in limiting the efficacy of rifamycins, is uncertain for the newer drugs. Post antibiotic effects are vital to the prevention of drug resistance and need exploration for new drugs. The main aims of current drug development are (1) to shorten treatment, and (2) to make it more convenient, by for instance using widely intermittent regimens. The current techniques for measuring efficacy during drug development start with in vitro models, including the Hu/Coates models, which should contain bacterial populations resembling the bacterial persisters in lesions that are responsible for the long duration of treatment. The next stage is the mouse model of the chemotherapy of established tuberculosis, which has proved remarkably useful in assessing the value of the different drugs. The main problem in clinical assessment arises from the use of relapse after treatment as the main end-point, and the consequent need for very large numbers of patients required to provide measurable relapse rates in final phase III licensing studies. For this reason, surrogate studies are necessary in phase II which require much smaller numbers of patients. The first such investigations are phase IIA studies of early bactericidal activity which establish whether the drug given alone has bactericidal activity on cavitary bacilli and which can estimate the minimal effective dose of the drug, useful for decisions of dose size. The next step should be phase IIB studies which measure the rate of elimination of viable bacilli in sputum during the initial 8-weeks of treatment with various combinations of the new drug with established drugs. Measurement can be as (1) the proportion of patients with positive sputum at the end of the 8-weeks period, the easiest method but the least sensitive, or (2) as the speed with which sputum cultures become negative in a survival analysis, or (3) as the mean regression in modeling of serial sputum collections colony counts (SSCC). The relation between these surrogate estimates and the amoun of treatment shortening that can be obtained has still to be worked out."

As part of efforts to prevent the introduction of communicable diseases into the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts surveillance for selected diseases in international travelers. One of these diseases, tuberculosis (TB), received substantial attention in May 2007 when the CDC issued travel restrictions and a federal isolation order for a person with drug-resistant TB who traveled internationally against public health recommendations. Methods. Reports of TB in international travelers in the CDC's Quarantine Activity Reporting System (QARS) from 1 June 2006 through 31 May 2007 (year 1) were compared with reports from 1 June 2007 through 31 May 2008 (year 2). These reports were classified using the CDC and American Thoracic Society guidelines and analyzed for epidemiologic characteristics and trends. Results. Among QARS reports, 4.6\% were classified as active TB disease and 1.7\% as no TB disease. Active TB disease reports increased from 2.5\% of QARS reports in year 1 to 6.4\% in year 2 (P < .001). The proportion P < .001 of active TB disease reports leading to a federal travel restriction increased from 6.8\% in year 1 to 15.4\% in year 2 (P = .08). Conclusions. The significant increase in reports of international travelers with TB disease likely represents more attention to and a higher index of suspicion for TB. The increased use of federal travel restrictions was associated with the development of new procedures to limit travel for public health reasons. Continued efforts are needed to decrease the number of persons with TB who travel while potentially contagious."

Moving from ancient times to the present, the algae remain more important than most people realize. Today, the production of oxygen by algae (ca. 50\% of all oxygen production) is another reason for saying ``our lives depend on algae.{''} Those who love seafood should thank the algae because algae are the primary producers upon which aquatic ecosystems depend. Thanks should come from all who are vegetarians or omnivores, because all land plants derive from a freshwater class of green algae and all land-animals-including the cows that provide the steaks for meat-lovers-depend directly or indirectly on land plants for food and often for shelter as well. As we use up the oil deposits provided by the ancient algae, we are turning to the modern algae for help. Given the photosynthetic abilities of the algae, they are one of the major focuses for sustainable biofuel production and CO2 consumption. Finally, the algae that give us the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the fuel for our cars (past and, perhaps, future), are also a source of active pharmaceutical compounds that can be used against drug-resistant bacterial strains, viruses (including Herpes Simplex and AIDS), and cancers. Roses are pretty and oak trees are impressive, but no other groups of ``plants{''} have done so much, for so long, and, for so many as have the algae!."

Methods: Nasal swab specimens were obtained from the neonatal unit staff for the presence of MRSA. MRSA-colonized staffs were offered decolonization therapy with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or 2% mupirocin ointment. Every 2-4 months after decolonizaton, repeat nasal swab specimens were obtained. Also, samples from the neonatal unit environment and room air were collected. Results: Successful decolonization was achieved in 92% of the cases in 2 weeks after decolonization therapy, but most of the staffs were recolonized after several months. The nature of antibiotic susceptibility was changed from multi-drug-susceptible to multi-drug-resistant. The most frequently contaminated objects were dressing carts, computer keyboards, bassinets and washbowls. In environmental cultures using the settle microbe count method, the colony counts were decreased significantly at the last study period compared with the first study period in the neonatal room, breastfeeding room, service room, and dressing room (P0.05). Conclusion: Effective control of sustained MRSA transmission within an institution may require prompt identification, treatment, and monitoring of colonized and/or infected staffs. However, nasal decolonization therapy may induce multi-drug-resistant MRSA infection and had no effect on decreasing the MRSA nasal carriage rate in our study.

DESIGN: The number and cost of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filter and dust-mist (DM) respirators for 1989 to 1994 were obtained from study hospital purchasing departments, and the costs of HCW fit-testing and education programs for 1994 were estimated from information provided by infection control practitioners. Costs of N-class respirator programs were estimated for study hospitals using retrospective cost analysis and an observational study. SETTING: Four urban hospitals with, and one rural community hospital without, documented nosocomial or occupational transmission of multidrug-resistant TB. RESULTS: During the study period, four of five hospitals introduced HEPA and DM respirators and respirator education and fit-testing programs. Median costs in 1994 were \$83,900 (range, \$2,000-\$223,000) for respirators and \$17,187 (range, \$8,736-\$26,175) for respiratory fit-testing programs.

Methods and Results: Intercellular signalling between physically discrete populations of E. coli BL21 was analysed in bi-partite Petri dishes. Transfer of a growth-promoting signal resulted in induction of resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. Optimal expression of the signal occurred when the signalling population was established as a bacterial lawn for 24 h. This represented an entry into the stationary phase of growth, as indicated by the expression profile of the RNA polymerase subunit sigma(38) (sigma(S) ; sigma S). The growth-promoting effect was also observed when E. coli DH5alpha (luxS(-)) was used as the signalling population. Preventing passage of air between the two populations resulted in a complete cessation of the growth-promoting effect. Conclusions: A growth-promoting signal occurs between physically separated cultures of E. coli . The exact nature of the signal remains to be determined but does not involve the production of autoinducer-2 from the luxS gene. Signal transmission is likely to involve airborne transfer of a signal species. Significance and Impact of the Study: Intercellular signalling systems exist in bacteria that enable antibiotic resistance to be conferred between physically separated populations."

Employing different agar based media bacteria were isolated from emission samples and subsequently identified by MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene compositions in samples were investigated at four different time points within a fattening period by the generation and analyses of clone libraries. The identified bacterial species reflect the turkeys' skin-associated bacterial community. Species of the genera Staphylococcus/Jeotgalicoccus as well as Coryne-bacterium stationis were predominantly detected. The clone libraries' sequences were predominated by those who were most closely related to species known as members of turkeys' microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic intestinal community. Results of investigated clone libraries show as well that species of the genera Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Romboutsia, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, Megamonas, Jeotgalicoccus, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Clostridium seems to be emitted at each time point during fattening. A lot of sequences could not be assigned to any of jet cultured bacterial species. This demonstrates a big gap in our knowledge. Aerococcus viridans deserves special attention for health risk assessments in future. In context to measuring strategies the implementations of potentially new indicator-micorganisms is part of the discussion."

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed case files from January 2003 to December 2006 of 13 patients with MDR-TB underwent pulmonary resection. Results: Of 13 patients, 7 (53.9\%) were sputum positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis preoperatively, though after surgery, they were sputum negative. Lobectomy was performed in 8 (61.5\%) and pneumonectomy, in 5 (38.5\%). In the lobectomy group, 2 patients had an additional superior segmentectomy and 1 had a middle lobectomy for other segmental or lobar lesions. Operative mortality was 7.6\% (1/13). There were no late surgical deaths. In the early postoperative period, 3 patients had serious complications (postoperative bleeding, prolonged air leak, expansion deficit, bronchopleural fistula and empyema) that were resolved with surgery (morbidity 23.0\%). The 12 patients who survived the operation received appropriate chemotherapy and were followed up for 24-37 months. None of the patients relapsed, and the overall cure rate was 92.3\% (12/13). Conclusion: Even with high morbidity in the early post-operative period, surgery, in addition to medical therapy, offers higher cure rates than only medical therapy; however, meticulous preoperative evaluation of patients is needed."

Cough is the major determinant of tuberculosis transmission. Despite this, there is a paucity of information regarding characteristics of cough frequency throughout the day and in response to tuberculosis therapy. Here we evaluate the circadian cycle of cough, cough frequency risk factors, and the impact of appropriate treatment on cough and bacillary load. Methods. We prospectively evaluated human immunodeficiency virus-negative adults (n = 64) with a new diagnosis of culture-proven, drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis immediately prior to treatment and repeatedly until treatment day 62. At each time point, participant cough was recorded (n = 670) and analyzed using the Cayetano Cough Monitor. Consecutive coughs at least 2 seconds apart were counted as separate cough episodes. Sputum samples (n = 426) were tested with microscopic-observation drug susceptibility broth culture, and in culture-positive samples (n = 252), the time to culture positivity was used to estimate bacillary load. Results. The highest cough frequency occurred from 1 pm to 2 pm, and the lowest from 1 am to 2 am (2.4 vs 1.1 cough episodes/hour, respectively). Cough frequency was higher among participants who had higher sputum bacillary load (P < .01). Pretreatment median cough episodes/hour was 2.3 (interquartile range {[}IQR], 1.2-4.1), which at 14 treatment days decreased to 0.48 (IQR, 0.01.4) and at the end of the study decreased to 0.18 (IQR, 0.0-0.59) (both reductions P < .001). By 14 treatment days, the probability of culture conversion was 29\% (95\% confidence interval, 19\%-41\%). Conclusions. Coughs were most frequent during daytime. Two weeks of appropriate treatment significantly reduced cough frequency and resulted in one-third of participants achieving culture conversion. Thus, treatment by 2 weeks considerably diminishes, but does not eliminate, the potential for airborne tuberculosis transmission."

Total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter were enumerated from half-carcass rinses. Species of Campylobacter isolates was determined by a commercial PCR method, which was followed by molecular subtyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility to 9 drugs. Although significantly fewer of each bacterial type were detected per milliliter from immersion-chilled carcasses than from air-chilled car-casses, in each case the difference was less than 1 log(10) cfu/mL. Chilling method did not affect species; both Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were recovered. Results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtyping did not suggest that either chilling method selected for any specific subtypes; most subtypes were found on carcass halves used for both the air chill and water immersion chill. Resistance to 2 antimicrobial drugs was noted in 9 C. coli isolates, 6 from air-chilled carcass halves and 3 from immersion-chilled carcass halves. These data showed that immersion-chilled carcasses had lower numbers of bacteria; however, the difference was not large and may have been due to simple dilution. Both methods were effective for lowering carcass temperature, and neither chilling method seemed to select for specific species, subtypes, or antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter."

The objective of this study was to measure the filtration efficiencies of a single-use submicron surgical mask, two disposable dust/mist respirators, a dust/mist/fume respirator, and a high-efficiency particulate air respirator against aerosolized mycobacteria. Facial fit was not addressed. Methods: In a specially designed enclosed test apparatus, an aerosol was generated with a Collison nebulizer from a known concentration of Mycobacteria chelonae, used as a surrogate for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Aerosol concentrations were measured with Andersen samplers upstream and downstream of the test masks and respirators, which were heat sealed to a metal plate. Results: Mean efficiencies ranged from approximately 97\% for the surgical mask and a dust/mist respirator to more than 99.99\% for the high-efficiency particulate air respirator. Measurements of filter efficiency with an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer for the M. chelonae aerosol and independent challenge tests with latex spheres correlated closely with measurements of M.

The prevailing application of the WHO re-treatment protocol indiscriminately to all re-treatment cases sets the stage for an increase in mortality and MDR-TB nosocomial transmission. A comprehensive search was performed of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register and Medline database including the bibliographies of the retrieved reference. The TB diagnosis paradigm which for decades relied on smear sputum and culture is likely to change with the advent of the point-of-care diagnostic, Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Until the new DST infrastructure is available, along with clinical trials for both, current and new approaches to retreatment TB in areas heavily affected by HIV and TB, there are cost effective administrative, environmental, and protective measures that may be immediately instituted. The severe lack of infection control practices in sub Saharan Africa may jeopardise the recent strides in MDR-TB management. Cost effective infection control measures must be immediately implemented, otherwise the development of further drug resistance may offset recent strides in MDR-TB management. Indiscriminate use of the WHO standardized retreatment protocol can lead to nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB by: -Precluding early diagnosis and prompt separation of patients who experienced treatment failure category and thereby more likely to have MDR-TB. -Leaving patients from the treatment failure category in health establishments on ineffective standard retreatment regimen until the DST results are known. -targeting only patients who have had prior TB therapy, new severely debilitated TB patients having primary unrecognized MDR-TB may continue spreading resistant organisms."

The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of aerosolized bacteria and endotoxin, particularly fecal indicators, staphylococci, and enterococci, associated with poultry house and outdoor air. Aerosol samples were collected at multiple locations on the farm and in the house. Antibiotic resistance was investigated using the Kirby Bauer method on selected isolates using twelve different antibiotics spanning both narrow to broad spectrums of effectiveness. Overall there was a cyclical increase in bacterial concentrations as flocks progressed from pre-flock to late-flock, with >2 orders magnitude lower concentration during pre-flock periods (no chickens), in both the litter and aerosol samples. The house environment provided for significantly concentrated bacterial and endotoxin levels. It was estimated that Staphylococcus bacteria accounted for at least 90\% of cultured aerobic bacteria and culture-independent 165 rRNA analyses demonstrated that significant population changes occurred from pre- to late-flock. Rarely was an isolate resistant to more than 4 antibiotic classes; however there was a trend upwards in overall resistance of enterococci as the flock cycle progressed. It appears that although levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria were highly concentrated within the house, levels were much lower outside of the house, and very little house escape occurred.

Materials and Methods: The study was a point-prevalence study involving over 300 patients. The presence of infection was determined according to the CDC criteria. Swabs were taken from the infected sites and identification and sensitivity were carried out using VITEK (R) 2 automated system. Characterisation of beta-lactamase was carried out at ARRML, Colindale, London. Results: The rate of SSI was 15\% for the clean and clean-contaminated categories while that for the dirty contaminated category was 85\% (NNIS risk index 0). Cultures yielded definite or probable pathogens from 64\% (9/14) of the patients with SSI. In 1/3(rd) of the cultures, Staphylococcus aureus was grown and the rest had Enterobacteriaceae, either extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers or Amp-C hyperproducers and, alarmingly, three isolates were positive for newly recognised New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). In medicine, 87\% (n = 99) of the patients had a peripheral IV access device, 55\% developed associated phlebitis/infection and, in seven, probable pathogens were isolated (Candida species and Escherichia coli producing ESBL and NDM-1, respectively, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). All ESBL and metallo-beta-lactamase producers were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials, the latter being sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. The study also found that all post-operative patients were on antibiotics, 92\% on IV {[}213 defined daily doses (DDD)/100 post-op patients] limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (26\%) and aminoglycosides (24\%) and imidazole derivatives (30\%). In medicine, 83\% (n = 82) were on IV antibiotics (123 DDD/100 bed-days), limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (74\%). Conclusion: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major problem predisposing patients to harm by multi-resistant pathogens. Carbapenems were in little use in this hospital, but the selection pressure exerted by cephalosporins and other unrelated classes was sufficient to select NDM-1-producing strains due to co-selection, suggesting a role of single plasmid carrying resistance genes to multiple classes."

NH3 content of stall air and its influence on morbidity and animal losses in cattle fattening houses During the period October 1970 to June 1971 the most important stall climatic factors (temperature, humidity, wind velocity and ammonia content of the stall air) were determined on three large cattle fattening enterprises in the neighbourhood of Temesvar in Rumania and the losses resulting from disease and emergency slaughter were measured. It was possible to find a direct relationship between too high concentrations of toxic gas in the buildings, the development of disease and the severity of signs of the disease (mainly respiratory disorders). The authors consider that in such cases the continuing recurrence of disease, despite treatment, is due less to antibiotic resistance of the causal agents than to the influence of high ammonia levels giving rise to new infections. On the basis of these observations it is suggested that ammonia is the most important factor in producing damage in fattening cattle stalls.

Biofilm tolerance to antibiotics is well described but limited work has been conducted on the efficacy of heat disinfection and sterilization against biofilms. AIM: To test the susceptibility of planktonic, hydrated biofilm and dry-surface biofilm forms of Staphylococcus aureus, to dry-heat and wet-heat treatments. METHODS: S. aureus was grown as both hydrated biofilm and dry-surface biofilm in the CDC biofilm generator. Biofilm was subjected to a range of temperatures in a hot-air oven (dry heat), water bath or autoclave (wet heat). FINDINGS: Dry-surface biofilms remained culture positive even when treated with the harshest dry-heat condition of 100 degrees C for 60min. Following autoclaving samples were culture negative but 62-74% of bacteria in dry-surface biofilms remained alive as demonstrated by live/dead staining and confocal microscopy. Dry-surface biofilms subjected to autoclaving at 121 degrees C for up to 30min recovered and released planktonic cells. Recovery did not occur following autoclaving for longer or at 134 degrees C, at least during the time-period tested. Hydrated biofilm recovered following dry-heat treatment up to 100 degrees C for 10min but failed to recover following autoclaving despite the presence of 43-60% live cells as demonstrated by live/dead staining. CONCLUSION: S. aureus dry-surface biofilms are less susceptible to killing by dry heat and steam autoclaving than hydrated biofilms, which are less susceptible to heat treatment than planktonic suspensions."

The purpose of this study was to determine colonization of Candida spp. in preterm babies and identify the risk factors. METHODS: Swabs from oral, rectum, groin and umblicus of 103 preterm and 100 term neonates were obtained within 24 hours of birth, day three, day five, day seven and thereafter every week till the neonate was admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Swabs were also collected from the mother's vagina prior to delivery. Twice every month, air of the NICU was sampled by settle plate and swabs were collected from the hands of health care workers and inanimate objects of NICU. Identification and speciation was done by standard methods. Antibiotic sensitivity was studied against amphotericin B, ketoconazole and fluconazole by disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Colonization with Candida was significantly higher in preterms. Earliest colonization was of oral mucosa and 77.1% of the preterms had colonised at various sites by the first week of life. Significant risk factors in colonized versus non-colonized preterms were male sex, longer duration of rupture of membranes (DROM), administration of steroids and antibiotics and vaginal colonization of mothers, whereas those in preterms versus terms were low birth weight and gestational age. C. albicans was the commonest species, both in the colonized preterms (45.9%) and vagina of mothers. Resistance was seen to fluconazole and ketoconazole only.

Corneal blindness, in developing countries is predominantly associated with infections. In India, nearly 30-35% of all culture positive infectious keratitis are caused fungi. Laboratory diagnosis mainly depends upon proper collection and transport of clinical specimens. In fungal keratitis, corneal scraping is the ideal sample, but occasionally corneal biopsy or anterior chamber aspirate may also be needed. Corneal scraping is usually by Kimura spatula, under a slit lamp examination, after anaesthetizing the cornea with topical anaesthetic like 0.4% proparcaine. Corneal biopsy is done by a minor trephining and AC aspirate using a sterile tuberculin syringe. In case of endophthalmitis, 150-200 l of aqueous humour is collected. Vitreous fluid (500-1000 l), however, is collected by pars plana vitrectomy onto sterile tuberculin syringe, the needle is then fixed to a sterile rubber bung after expelling air from the syringe. The collected sample is immediately transported to the laboratory. Swabs from the regurgitating lacrimnal sacs and wound aspirate/swabs are the ideal specimens for dacryocystitis and orbital cellulites, respectively. These samples are cultured onto SDA slants following standard procedures. The main draw back of culture is its long incubation time (5 to 14 days), though it is indispensable from the view point of the specificity. Direct examination (KOH wet mount, Gram's, Giemsa or calcofluor fluorescent staining methods) of the specimen, however, is quick and immensely helpful for ophthalmologist. The newer rapid methods, such as molecular techniques are also available and the management of patients can be according to the results obtained. With the advent of novel antifungal agents such as newer azoles and cell wall acting antifungals like echinocandins, the clinician has the wider option of selecting the therapeutic modality. In the event of the increasing reports of in vitro drug resistance to much frequently used azoles, polyenes and 5-fluorocytosines, clinical applicability of the newer antifungal agents seems to be quite promising."

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) often suffer from chronic infections by the opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces multiple virulence factors, including rhamnolipids. The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (azm) has been shown to improve lung function in patients with CF without reducing the bacterial count within the lung. However, the mechanism of this effect is still debated. It has previously been shown that azm increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in a bronchial epithelial cell line. In this study we used an air-liquid interface model of human airway epithelia and measured TER, changes in TJ expression and architecture after exposure to live P. aeruginosa PAO1, and PAO1-Deltarhl which is a PAO1 mutant lacking rhlA and rhlB, which encode key enzymes for rhamnolipid production. In addition, the cells were challenged with bacterial culture medium conditioned by these strains, purified rhamnolipids, or synthetic 3O-C(12)-HSL. Virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduced TER and caused TJ rearrangement in the bronchial epithelium, exposing the epithelium to further bacterial infiltration. Pretreatment of the bronchial epithelium with azm attenuated this effect and facilitated epithelial recovery. These data suggest that azm protects the bronchial epithelium during P. aeruginosa infection independent of antimicrobial activity, and could explain in part the beneficial results seen in clinical trials of patients with CF."

Microfluidics offers a way to accomplish this goal. Here we presented an integrated microfluidic device for culturing and screening of G. lambda. The device consisted of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchip with an aerobic culture system. In the microchip, the functionality of integrated concentration gradient generator (CGG) with micro-scale cell culture enables dose response experiment to be performed in a simple and reagent-saving way. The diffusion-based culture chambers allowed growing G. lamblia at the in vivo like environment. It notable that the highly air permeable material of parallel chambers maintain uniform anaerobic environment in different chambers easily. Using this device, G. lamblia were successfully cultured and stressed on-chip. In all cases, a dose-related inhibitory response was detected. The application of this device for these purposes represents the first step in developing a completely integrated microfluidic platform for high-throughput screening and might be expanded to other assays based on in vitro culture of G. lamblia with further tests.

Bacterial and fungal aerosols in five different wastewater treatment plants in Poland were studied, including the pioneering antibiotic resistance testing of airborne bacteria. Concentration level was measured using the six-stage Andersen impactor. After incubation, bioaerosol particles captured on nutrient media on Petri dishes were quantitatively evaluated and qualitatively identified. It was found that the concentration levels of both airborne bacteria and fungi ranged from 10A(2) to 10A(3) colony-forming units/mA(3), in all stages of the wastewater treatment plants. The patterns of size distributions of airborne bacteria and fungi were very similar, showing dominant peaks typically in the size range between 3.3 and 4.7 mu m. The majority fraction of small bacterial and fungal particles (less than 4.7 mu m) in the studied areas indicates that the bioaerosol is relatively fresh, and mostly of local origin. The Gram-positive cocci and nonsporing Gram-positive rods were the dominating forms in the studied wastewater treatment plants environment. The existing differences in the concentration levels between sampling sites enabled identification of the main bioaerosol sources. The highest concentration of bacterial aerosol appeared in sections, where activated sludge post-processing and mechanical purifying are conducted. The most frequently occurring species in the sampled bacterial aerosol were Gram-positive cocci and nonsporing Gram-positive rods. Multi-antibiotic resistance testing showed that among the isolated airborne bacteria, the most antibiotic-resistant features were present among Bacillus species (especially Bacillus mycoides)."

With identification of NADPH oxidase (Nox) system of respiratory epithelium, the antimicrobial role of ROS has been studied. Duox2 is the most abundant Nox isoform and produces the regulated amount of ROS in respiratory epithelium. Duox2-derived ROS are involved in antiviral innate immune responses but more studies are needed to verify the mechanism. In respiratory epithelium, Duox2-derived ROS is critical for recognition of virus through families retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) at the early stage of antiviral innate immune responses. Various secreted interferons (IFNs) play essential roles for antiviral host defense by downstream cell signaling, and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes is started to suppress viral replication. Type I and type III IFNs are verified more responsible for influenza A virus (IAV) infection in respiratory epithelium and Duox2 is required to regulate IFN-related immune responses. Transient overexpression of Duox2 using cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) induces secretion of type I and type III IFNs and significantly attenuated IAV replication in respiratory epithelium.

TB diagnosis is difficult due to the non-specific symptoms, the increased frequency of extrapulmonary disease, the delay in radiological examinations, and the high rate of tuberculin anergy. Neonatal TB can be acquired in utero (congenital TB), or through airborne transmission after delivery (postnatal TB). Congenital TB is extremely rare and does not cause fetal malformations. It may be evident at birth, although it usually presents after the second week of life. In newborns with no family history of TB, the disease should be considered in cases of miliary pneumonia, hepatosplenomegaly with focal lesions, or lymphocytic meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia, especially in those born to immigrants from high TB-burden countries.

In order to solve this problem, 3 amalgam fillings were removed from the teeth of the subject of this case study. In order to fill the newly created empty spaces in the teeth where the amalgams had formerly existed, a synthetic dental-filling substance was introduced and to solidify the synthetic substance, curing light (wavelength range reportedly between 400-520 nm) was radiated onto the substance in order to accelerate the solidifying process by photo-polymerization reaction. In spite of considerable care not to inhale mercury vapor or swallow minute particles of dental amalgam during the process of removing it by drilling, mercury entered the body of the subject. Precautions such as the use of a rubber dam and strong air suction, as well as frequent water suctioning and washing of the mouth were insufficient. Significant deposits of mercury, previously non-existent, were found in the lungs, kidneys, endocrine organs, liver, and heart with abnormal low-voltage ECGs (similar to those recorded 1-3 weeks after I.V. injection of radioisotope Thallium-201 for Cardiac SPECT) in all the limb leads and Vl(but almost normal ECGs in the precordial leads V2-V6) the day after the procedures were performed. Enhanced mercury evaporation by increased temperature and microscopic amalgam particles created by drilling may have contributed to mercury entering the lungs and G.I. system and then the blood circulation, creating abnormal deposits of mercury in the organs named above. Such mercury contamination may then contribute to intractable infections or pre-cancer. However, these mercury deposits, which commonly occur in such cases, were successfully eliminated by the oral intake of 100 mg tablet of Chinese parsley (Cilantro) 4 times a day (for average weight adults) with a number of drug-uptake enhancement methods developed by the Ist author, including different stimulation methods on the accurate organ representation areas of the hands (which have been mapped using the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test), without injections of chelating agents. ingestion of Chinese parsley, accompanied by drug-uptake enhancement methods, was initiated before the amalgam removal procedure and continued for about 2 to 3 weeks afterwards, and ECGs became almost normal. During the use of strong bluish curing light to create a photo-polymerization reaction to solidify the synthetic filling material, the adjacent gingiva and the side of the tongue were inadvertently exposed. This exposure to the strong bluish light was found to produce pre-cancerous conditions in the gingiva, the exposed areas of the tongue, as well as in the corresponding organs represented on those areas of the tongue, and abnormally increased enzyme levels in the liver. These abnormalities were also successfully reversed by the oral intake of a mixture of EPA with DHA and Chinese parsley, augmented by one of the non-invasive drug-uptake enhancement methods previously described by the Ist author, repeated 3 times each day for 2 weeks."

We observed that their injection can rapidly and transiently induce the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in livers of mice and enhance circulating nitrate levels. Treatment of mice with bpV(phen) or bpV(pic) completely controlled progression of leishmaniasis in an NO-dependent manner,since inhibition of iNOS with aminoguanidine completely reversed this pV-mediated protection. This NO-dependent pV-mediated protection was further demonstrated by the incapacity of bpV(phen)-treated Nramp(-/-), iNOS(-/-) mutant mice to control Leishmania major infection. Using an air pouch model, we showed that bpV(phen) can strongly modulate secretion of L. major-induced pro-inflammatory molecules and neutrophil recruitment.

About 14% of strains showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype and, of them, seven strains carried class 1 integrons containing predominantly the dfrA1-aadA1 array. One multidrug-resistant strain was found in both inside and outside air, suggesting that the airborne spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria from the animal housing facilities to the surroundings is feasible. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives a genetic background of the antimicrobial resistance problem in a dairy cattle farm and shows that air can act as a source for dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.  2016 Society of Chemical Industry.  2016 Society of Chemical Industry"

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients on treatment are currently assumed to remain infectious for months. While the resources required for prolonged hospitalization are a barrier to the scale-up of MDR-TB treatment, the safety of community treatment is clear. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of treatment on infectiousness among MDR-TB patients. METHODS: A series of five human-to-guinea pig TB transmission studies was conducted to test various interventions for infection control. Guinea pigs in adjacent chambers were exposed to exhaust air from a hospital ward occupied by mostly sputum smear- and culture-positive MDR-TB patients. The guinea pigs then underwent tuberculin skin testing for infection. Only the control groups of guinea pigs from each study (no interventions used) provide the data for this analysis. The number of guinea pigs infected in each study is reported and correlated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility relative to treatment. RESULTS: Despite exposure to presumably infectious MDR-TB patients, infection percentages among guinea pigs ranged from 1\% to 77\% in the five experiments conducted. In one experiment in which guinea pigs were exposed to 27 MDR-TB patients newly started on effective treatment for 3 months, there was minimal transmission. In four other experiments with greater transmission, guinea pigs had been exposed to patients with unsuspected extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis who were not on effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, effective treatment appears to render MDR-TB patients rapidly noninfectious. Further prospective studies on this subject are needed."

This consensus document presents background data and evidence-based recommendations for practices that are intended to decrease the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens among CF patients from contaminated respiratory therapy equipment or the contaminated environment and thereby reduce the burden of respiratory illness. Included are recommendations applicable in the acute care hospital, ambulatory, home care, and selected non-healthcare settings. The target audience includes all healthcare workers who provide care to CF patients. Antimicrobial management is beyond the scope of this document. The following information set the stage for the development of this guideline: (a) Studies published since 1994 that further our understanding of the modes of transmission of pathogens and effective strategies to interrupt transmission among CF patients provide the data needed for evidence-based guidelines. (b) Improved microbiology methods provide more accurate detection and further definition of the epidemiology of pathogens in CF patients. (c) The publication of the HICPAC/CDC (Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals in 1996 defined standard precautions and recommended universal application to care for all patients at all times to prevent transmission of infectious agents that may not yet have been identified. (d) The previously published HICPAC/CDC guidelines for prevention of healthcare-associated infections have not included background information and recommendations for the specific circumstances of patients with CE Thus, specific guidelines for CF patients are needed. (e) The link between acquisition of pathogens and morbidity and mortality is well established. Prevention of acquisition of specific pathogens may further improve the mean survival of CF patients, which has increased to 33.4 years in 2001. A multidisciplinary committee consisting of healthcare professionals from the United States, Canada, and Europe with experience in CF care and healthcare epidemiology/infection control reviewed the relevant literature and developed evidence-based recommendations graded according to the published peer-reviewed supportive data. The participants chose to use the following CDC/HICPAC system for categorizing recommendations based on previous experience in crafting infection control guidelines beyond CF: Category IA. Strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB. Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by some experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies and a strong theoretical rationale. Category IC. Required for implementation, as mandated by federal and/or state regulation or standard. Category II. Suggested for implementation and supported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies or a theoretical rationale. No recommendation; unresolved issue. Practices for which insufficient evidence or no consensus regarding efficacy exist. Category IA and IB recommendations are strongly recommended for implementation by all CF centers and considered to be ""best practice."" Implementation of Category II recommendations is advised by the committee, but individual centers may determine which Category II recommendations would be appropriate for their CF centers. This document integrates knowledge of microbiology laboratory methods, infection control principles, and epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in CF patients. Standardization of infection control practices across CF centers will provide safer environments for patients by reducing the risk of transmission of CF pathogens. In addition to infection control practices that are applicable to all CF patients at all times, specific infection control practices are recommended for inpatient. ambulatory, and non-healthcare settings, based on the types of activities and risks associated with the various settings. CF care teams as well as patients and their families must be well educated concerning the known risks and the effective preventive measures to ensure adherence to the evidence-based recommendations in this document. It will be beneficial for each CF center to evaluate the effectiveness of its infection control program to reduce transmission of pathogens and improve clinical outcomes. Collaboration between the CF care team and the CF center's infection control team will facilitate effective implementation that takes into consideration the psychosocial impact of these recommendations. This document was reviewed by the members of HIC-PAC, and the recommendations were found to be consistent with the principles of infection control that serve as the foundation of HICPAC/CDC guidelines for prevention of healthcare-associated infections. This guideline was formally endorsed by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology boards in 2002-2003. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has endorsed the recommendations for susceptibility testing. Infection Control Principles CF pathogens are transmitted by the droplet and contact routes. Therefore, practices that contain respiratory secretions and prevent transmission of respiratory tract pathogens must be taught to patients and their families as well as to CF healthcare workers. Such practices must be followed with all CF patients and cannot be implemented according to the specific microbiology results of individual CF patients because microbiology methods are not 100% sensitive for the detection of CF pathogens. In addition to washing hands with an antimicrobial-containing soap and water, alcohol-based antiseptic hand rubs are now recommended when hands are not visibly soiled with blood or body fluids because of the improved efficacy of these products in removing microorganisms from the hands. Use of gowns, gloves, and masks follows the recommendations for standard, contact, and droplet precautions that have been developed by CDC/HICPAC2 to prevent healthcare-associated infections in all patients, ie, both CF and non-CF patients. Contact precautions plus standard precautions are recommended for all CF patients infected (or colonized) with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Burkholderia cepacia complex, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Recommendations for room placement, activities outside the hospital room, CF clinic logistics, and adjuvant measures to prevent infections are provided. No recommendation can be made for the routine wearing of masks by CF patients when leaving an inpatient room or when in the waiting room of a CF clinic. Specific practices for the use and care of respiratory therapy equipment recommended in this document are based on principles of disinfection and sterilization as well as findings from investigations of outbreaks of infections associated with contaminated respiratory therapy equipment. Cleaning devices, such as nebulizers, with removal of debris as soon as possible and before disinfection, and complete air drying are the critical steps in both healthcare and home settings. Microbiology, Molecular Typing, and Surveillance Because aggressive antimicrobial treatment of P. aeruginosa at initial acquistion may be associated with a delay in chronic infection and an improved clinical course, respiratory tract cultures should be obtained at least quarterly in CF patients with stable pulmonary status as well as at the time of pulmonary exacerbations. Specific recommendations are made for transport and processing of specimens, including the preferred selective media. Agar-based diffusion assays, eg, antibiotic-containing disks or E-tests, rather than automated commercial microbroth dilution systems are recommended for susceptibility testing of P. aeruginosa isolates. Molecular typing using appropriate methods, eg, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), rapid amplified polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR), and repetitive DNA sequence PCR (Rep-PCR), are recommended to assess strain relatedness of isolates from different patients when patient-to-patient transmission is suspected. Recommendations are made to develop surveillance in collaboration with the CF center's infection control team. S. aureus, including MRSA, P aeruginosa, and B. cepacia complex are always targeted, whereas Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are included when considered epidemiologically important, eg, patient-to-patient transmission or an outbreak is suspected. Surveillance includes calculation of incidence and prevalence rates and review of antimicrobial susceptibility summaries with trend analysis. Surveillance reports should be shared between the infection control and CF care teams at least annually to evaluate effectiveness of the center's infection control program. Selected B. cepacia complex isolates and nonfermenting gram-negative organisms for which species identification cannot be established after routine analysis should be submitted to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Burkholderia cepacia Research Laboratory and Repository for further study."

Antibiotics and ARGs are commonly detected in water, soil and air, with comparatively higher levels in human environment, including wastewater treatment plant and solid waste processing chains. ARGs are induced by antibiotic residuals accumulated in the environment, but ARGs propagation is dominated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and the composition of microbial communities. In addition, other factors including temperature, light, and microbial communities all could impose effects on the degradation of ARGs and antibiotics, among which light is the most crucial factor in natural environment. In the engineered treatment systems, UV disinfection and biochemical degradation function well in ARGs and antibiotic removal, though not always so. Given these results, the review suggests that future study should focus on the mechanisms of antibiotics and ARGs propagation as well as specific treatment technologies.  2015, Science Press.

UVGI lamps require that radiometric measurements be performed to ensure their safe and effective use. This study evaluates 10 detectors that measure the ultraviolet radiation hazard of low-pressure mercury UVGI lamps, including a polychromator spectroradiometer, narrowband detectors designed to measure the ultraviolet radiation in a short range of wavelengths, and broadband detectors with a varying spectral response designed to follow the UV hazard action spectrum. The angular responses, spectral responses, and linearity of the detectors were measured and compared. The agreement between the measured angular responses and the ideal cosine responses varied widely among the detectors, and in general, the detectors with diffusing optics agreed significantly better with the ideal cosine response. The spectral responses at 254 nm also varied widely among the detectors, and, in general, the narrowband detectors agreed more closely with the 254 nm irradiances measured under the same conditions by a double monochromator spectroradiometer. All detectors displayed good linearity. The angular and spectral response data were then used to develop correction factors for the effective irradiance measurements of two UVGI sources, each measured at 10, 20, and 30 cm. The measured effective irradiances were compared with those measured by a double monochromator spectroradiometer with an integrating sphere input optic. Prior to correction, the effective irradiances measured by the detectors varied widely, ranging from 0.29 to 2.7 times those measured by the spectroradiometer. The application of cosine and spectral response correction factors significantly improved the agreement for the effective irradiances measured by all of the detectors, typically to within 10-20\%. Awareness of these detector characteristics can play a key role in ensuring the accuracy of health hazard measurements of UVGI lamps."

Mobile sources emit many combustion-derived pollutants, including formaldehyde, in association with respirable carbon particles. Because it is hydrophilic, most of the inhaled formaldehyde is absorbed in the upper respiratory tract. However, if the organic vapor is adsorbed on respirable particles, formaldehyde may be deposited in the deep lung with the inhaled particles and may be available to interact adversely with cells along the lung parenchyma. On the respiratory surface, the alveolar macrophage phagocytic system plays the pivotal role in defending the lung against infectious agents. Susceptibility to respiratory infections is a relevant and sensitive indicator of the adverse effects of air pollution because acute and chronic exposures to a variety of air pollutants have been shown to decrease pulmonary antibacterial defenses. The goal of this research was to investigate whether exposure to formaldehyde decreases resistance to respiratory infections through dysfunctions of the alveolar macrophage phagocytic system. The study also explored whether interactions between formaldehyde and respirable carbon black particles alter susceptibility to respiratory infections and impairment of alveolar macrophage phagocytosis by delivering adsorbed formaldehyde to the deep lung with the inhaled particles. A carbon black, Regal GR, was used in these studies as a surrogate for the carbonaceous core of Diesel particulate matter. This material was selected to represent the worst-case scenario because the carbon black was expected to adsorb formaldehyde strongly. To accomplish this goal, mice were exposed to formaldehyde and to carbon black and formaldehyde combinations; increased susceptibility to respiratory infections was quantified by alveolar macrophage-dependent intrapulmonary killing of Staphylococcus aureus after an inhalation challenge with the bacterium. The salient findings of the bactericidal studies are as follows: Fifteen parts per million (ppm)* formaldehyde impaired the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus when exposure followed the bacterial challenge. One ppm formaldehyde impaired the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus when exposure preceded and was continued after the bacterial challenge. Coexposures to target concentrations of 3.5 mg/m3 carbon black and 2.5 ppm formaldehyde, or 10 mg/m3 carbon black and 5 ppm formaldehyde after the bacterial challenge had no effect on the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus. Preexposure for four hours per day for four days to target concentrations of 3.5 mg/m3 carbon black and 2.5 ppm formaldehyde had no effect on the intrapulmonary killing of S. aureus when the assay was performed one day after the cessation of exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Gram-negative opportunistic pathogenic bacteria (GNOPB) were isolated, and antibiotic susceptibility tests against 18 commonly used antibiotics, including 11 -lactam antibiotics, 3 aminoglycosides, 2 fluoroquinolones, 1 furan and 1 sulfonamide, were conducted. More than 45% of airborne bacteria isolated from the pharmaceutical WWTP were resistant to three or more antibiotics, and some opportunistic pathogenic strains were resistant to 16 antibiotics, whereas 45.3% and 50.3% of the strains isolated from residential community and municipal WWTP showed resistance to three or more antibiotics. The calculation of the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index demonstrated that the air environment in the pharmaceutical WWTP was highly impacted by antibiotic resistance, while the residential community and municipal WWTP was less impacted by antibiotic resistance. In addition, we determined that the dominant genera of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria isolated from all bioaerosol samples were Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas.

Isolation from water was dependent on air (r = 0 44) and water temperatures (r = 0 49) (P < 0 01) but was independent of rainfall (r = 0 15), chlorophyll a (r = 0 18), salinity (r = 0 2) or pH (r = 0 2) (P > 0 05). Isolation from plankton was dependent on temperature of air (r = 0 45), water temperature (r = 0 44), chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42), pH (r = 0 23) and salinity (r = 0 39) (P < 0 01). Cholera cases correlated with rainfall (r = 0 82, P < 0 01) and chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0 42, P < 0 05), but not with air temperature (r = 0 3, P = 0 37). Vibrio cholerae O1 possessed ctxB, ctxA, rstR and tcpA (ElTor), toxR, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, mshA and hylA. Among non-O1-non-O139, the distribution of virulence-associated and regulatory protein genes was heterogeneous with -0.7, 2 2, 94 77, 97 76, 99 25, 100 and 100\% isolates being positive for tcpA, toxT, rtxA, rtxC, hylA, toxR and mshA, respectively. Two-thirds of non-O1-non-O139 isolates exhibited antibiotic resistance to various antibiotics that did not correlate with geographical site or time of origin for the isolates. RAPD and AFLP showed V. cholerae to be a diverse bacterium. AFLP demonstrated separate lineages for non-O1-non-O139 and O1 isolates. Conclusion: Environmental parameters played a significant role in the emergence and spread of cholera and the abundance of V. cholerae. But based on virulence gene profiling and genetic fingerprinting, the possibility of origin of toxigenic isolates from nontoxigenic environmental isolates seems unlikely in freshwater environs of India. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study explains the ecology, epidemiology and seasonality of cholera in freshwater environs."

Materials studied as 2 x 5 cm coupons included stainless steel, acetal, polypropylene, and high-density polyethylene. A 6-strain rifampicin-resistant E. coli O157:H7 composite was used to inoculate (6 log CFU/mL, g, or cm(2)) tryptic soy broth (TSB), beef fat/lean tissue homogenate (FLH), conveyor belt-runoff fluids, ground beef, or beef fat. Coupons of each material were submerged (4 degrees C, 30 min) in the inoculated fluids or ground beef, or placed between 2 pieces of inoculated beef fat with pressure (20 kg) applied. Attachment/transfer of the pathogen was surface material and substrate dependent, although beef fat appeared to negate differences among surface materials. Beef fat was the most effective (P < 0.05) inoculation substrate, followed by ground beef, FLH, and TSB. Incubation (15 degrees C, 16 d) of beef fat-inoculated coupons in a beef fat homogenate (pH 4.21) allowed the pathogen to survive and grow on coupon surfaces, with maximal biofilm formation observed between 2 and 8 d of storage and when air was present at the liquid-solid interface. The results indicated that the process of fabricating beef carcasses may be conducive to the attachment of E. coli O157:H7 onto meat-contact surfaces and subsequent biofilm formation. Furthermore, it is recommended that substrates found in beef fabrication settings, rather than laboratory culture media, be used in studies designed to investigate E. coli O157:H7 biofilm development and control in these environments. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Findings of this study provide knowledge on the effect of type of beef carcass fabrication surface material, fabrication-floor fluids and residues, and incubation conditions on attachment/transfer and subsequent biofilm formation by E. coli O157:H7. The results highlight the importance of thoroughly cleaning soiled surfaces to remove all remnants of beef fat or other organic material that may harbor or protect microbial contaminants during otherwise lethal antimicrobial interventions."

The aim of this project was to monitor the potential role of the environmental risk factors involved in outbreak nosocomial infections. The microbiological studies from an emergency hospital from Bucharest have been started in January 2016 and samples were quarterly collected from drilling and tap water, waste water, air and surfaces. There were performed quantitative analyzes of microbiological contamination level and qualitative analyzes for pathogenic and resistant bacteria detection. Some pathogenic bacteria have been identified in the waste water and drilling water, indicating their interference. The antibiotic resistance properties were observed especially in bacteria from waste waters. Bacteria from vegetables from food preparation were detected in air samples and surfaces tests from kitchen. The results indicated that environmental factors from a medical unit could constitute a reservoir of microorganisms that can trigger nosocomial infections."

New approaches to prevent and treat unwanted biofilms are urgently required. To this end, three seagrass species (Enhalus acoroides, Halophila ovalis and Halodule pinifolia) collected in Vietnam and in India were investigated for their effects in mediating non-lethal interactions on sessile bacterial (Escherichia coli) and fungal (Candida albicans) cultures. The present study was focused on anti-biofilm activities of seagrass extracts, without killing cells. Methods: Methanolic extracts were characterized, and major compounds were identified by MS/MS analysis. The antibiofilm properties of the seagrass extracts were tested at sub-lethal concentrations by using microtiter plate adhesion assay. The performance of the most promising extract was further investigated in elegant bioreactors to reproduce mature biofilms both at the solid/liquid and the solid/air interfaces. Dispersion and bioluminescent assays were carried out to decipher the mode of action of the bioactive extract. Results: It was shown that up to 100 ppm of crude extracts did not adversely affect microbial growth, nor do they act as a carbon and energy source for the selected microorganisms. Seagrass extracts appear to be more effective in deterring microbial adhesion on hydrophobic surfaces than on hydrophilic. The results revealed that non-lethal concentrations of E. acoroides leaf extract: i) reduce bacterial and fungal coverage by 60.9 and 73.9\%, respectively; ii) affect bacterial biofilm maturation and promote dispersion, up to 70\%, in fungal biofilm; iii) increase luminescence in Vibrio harveyi by 25.8\%. The characterization of methanolic extracts showed the unique profile of the E. acoroides leaf extract. Conclusions: E. acoroides leaf extract proved to be the most promising extract among those tested. Indeed, the selected non-lethal concentrations of E. acoroides leaf extract were found to exert an antibiofilm effect on C. albicans and E. coli biofilm in the first phase of biofilm genesis, opening up the possibility of developing preventive strategies to hinder the adhesion of microbial cells to surfaces. The leaf extract also affected the dispersion and maturation steps in C. albicans and E. coli respectively, suggesting an important role in cell signaling processes."

This study presents a simulation model for a hypothetical hospital waiting room, in which the number of susceptible immunocompetent people in the waiting room follows a Poisson distribution (M = 5) in either low (annual number of TB patients = 5) or high TB risk settings (annual number of TB patients = 50), and used the model to evaluate the reduction of TB transmission risk by upper room UVGI. An exponential dose-response model was used for TB transmission and a two-zone model was used for evaluating the effect of tipper room UVGI. Upper room UVGI reduced TB risk by 1.6-fold at 3 muW/cm(2) UV irradiance in the upper room in the low TB risk setting and by 4.1-fold at 15 muW/cm(2) UV irradiance in the upper room in the high TB risk setting. Use of upper room UVGI also reduced the mean annual new infection rate from 2.2 to 1.3 infections per year at 3 muW/cm(2) and to 0.6 infections per year at 15 muW/cm(2) in our hypothetical high-risk settings. The effect of upper room UVGI was sensitive to both vertical air velocity (air mixing) and UV irradiance level.

In October 2010 four patients on the ICU of our tertiary care centre were colonized or infected with a multidrug-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA). An outbreak investigation was carried out and infection control measures were taken in an attempt to identify a potential source and stop transmission. The outbreak investigation included descriptive epidemiology, comprising retrospective case finding by reviewing the laboratory information system back to 2004 and prospective case finding by patient screening for MDR-PA. Furthermore, microbiological analysis, environmental screening and a case-control study were carried out. Infection control measures consisted of re-education of healthcare personnel on basic hygiene measures, auditing of hygiene procedures used in daily practice by infection control practitioners, and stepwise up-regulation of isolation measures. From February 2009 to January 2012, 44 patients on our ICU were found to be MDR-PA positive. MDR-PA isolates of the 44 patients showed two distinct AFLP patterns, with homology within each of the AFLP clusters of more than 93\%. The VIM metallo--lactamase gene was detected in 20 of 21 tested isolates. A descriptive epidemiology investigation identified the rooms with the highest numbers of MDR-PA positive patients. The case-control study showed three factors to be independently associated with MDR-PA positivity: admission to ICU subunit 1 (OR, 6.1; 95\% CI, 1.7, 22), surgery prior to or during admission (OR, 5.7; 95\% CI, 1.6, 20) and being warmed-up with the warm-air blanket (OR, 3.6; 95\% CI, 1.2, 11). After three environmental screening rounds, with sampling of sinks, furniture and devices in the ICU, without revealing a clear common source, a fourth environmental investigation included culturing of faucet aerators. Two faucets were found to be positive for MDR-PA and were replaced. The occurrence of new cases decreased with the strengthening of infection control measures and declined further with the removal of the common source. With this integrated approach a prolonged outbreak of P. aeruginosa was controlled. Contaminated faucet aerators on the ICU probably served as a persisting source, while interpatient transmission by medical staff was a likely way of spread. Seven months after the last case (January 2012) and 3months after cessation of extended isolation measures (May 2012), single cases started to occur on the ICU, with a total of seven patients in the past year. No common source has yet been found."

AtPDR8 is the only member of the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) ABC transporter subclass in Arabidopsis that is constitutively highly expressed. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring the AtPDR8 promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS), reporter expression was shown to he strong in the stomata and hydathode. In the stomata, transcripts of AtPDR8 were particularly frequent in the cells surrounding air spaces. Subcellular fractionation and immunochemical analysis showed that AtPDR8 was localized in the plasma membrane. When a knockout mutant of AtPDR8 (atpdr8) was infected with bacterial and oomycete pathogens, the plants exhibited chlorotic lesions and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. Cell death was detected in the atpdr8 mutants within 10 h of infection with the virulent bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. As a result, the growth of P syringae in the leaves of the atpdr8 mutant was reduced to 1\% of that in the wild type. The defense response genes, PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, VPE gamma, AtrbohD and AtrbohF were highly expressed when the mutant plants were grown under non-sterile conditions. The expression of the AtPDR8 gene was enhanced by infection of virulent and avirulent bacterial pathogens. Our results indicate that AtPDR8 is a key factor controlling the extent of cell death in the defense response and suggest that AtPDR8 transports some substance(s) which is closely related to the response of plants to pathogens."

Industry requires a rapid, waterless, zero-contact, chemical-free method for removing pathogens from food contact surfaces. Cold plasma was tested for its ability to inactivate Salmonella biofilms. A 3-strain Salmonella culture was grown to form adherent biofilms for 24, 48, or 72 h on a test surface (glass slides). These were placed on a conveyor belt and passed at various line speeds to provide exposure times of 5, 10, or 15 s. The test plate was either 5 or 7.5 cm under a plasma jet emitter operating at 1 atm using filtered air as the feed gas. The frequency of high-voltage electricity was varied from 23 to 48 kHz. At the closer spacing (5 cm), cold plasma reduced Salmonella biofilms by up to 1.57 log CFU/mL (5 s), 1.82 log CFU/mL (10 s), and 2.13 log CFU/mL (15 s). Increasing the distance to 7.5 cm generally reduced the efficacy of the 15 s treatment, but had variable effects on the 5 and 10 s treatments. Variation of the high-voltage electricity had a greater effect on 10 and 15 s treatments, particularly at the 7.5 cm spacing. For each combination of time, distance, and frequency, Salmonella biofilms of 24, 48, and 72 h growth responded consistently with each other. The results show that short treatments with cold plasma yielded up to a 2.13 log reduction of a durable form of Salmonella contamination on a model food contact surface. This technology shows promise as a possible tool for rapid disinfection of materials associated with food processing. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pathogens such as Salmonella can form chemical-resistant biofilms, making them difficult to remove from food contact surfaces. A 15 s treatment with cold plasma reduced mature Salmonella biofilms by up to 2.13 log CFU/mL (99.3%). This contact-free, waterless method uses no chemical sanitizers. Cold plasma may therefore have a practical application for conveyor belts, equipment, and other food contact surfaces where a rapid, dry antimicrobial process is required."

Samplings were performed in duplicate at 0.5, 1 and 2-3 m from the patients' heads.

In each of the 21 rooms, at least one of the environmental isolates was identical to a clinical isolate from the patient in that room. There was no significant difference in MRSA counts between the distance from the patient's head and the sampler. This study demonstrates that most patients with MRSA infection or colonisation of the respiratory tract shed viable MRSA into the air of their room.

In this context, a study evaluated strategies to curb livestock-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA). Fifty-one veal calf farms were assigned to one of 3 study arms: RAB farms reducing antimicrobials by protocol; RAB-CD farms reducing antimicrobials by protocol and applying a cleaning and disinfection program; and Control farms without interventions. MRSA carriage was tested in week 0 and week 12 of 2 consecutive production cycles in farmers, family members and veal calves. Interventions were validated and a cyclic rise in MRSA-prevalence in animals was shown with a more moderate increase in RAB farms. Prevalence in humans declined parallel over time in the study arms but RAB farms were at the lowest MRSA levels from the beginning of the study. In RAB-CD farms, human and animal prevalence did not differ from Control farms and MRSA air loads were significantly higher than in the other study arms. Mimicking the national trend, an overall AMU decrease (daily dosages per animal per cycle (DDDA/C)) was observed over 4 pre-study and the 2 study cycles; this trend did not have a significant effect on a set of evaluated farm technical parameters. AMU was positively associated with MRSA across study arms (ORs per 10 DDDA/C increase = 1.26 for both humans (p = 0.07) and animals (p = 0.12 in first cycle)). These results suggest that AMU reduction might be a good strategy for curbing MRSA in veal calf farming, however the specific cleaning and disinfecting program in RAB-CD farms was not effective. The drop in MRSA prevalence in people during the study could be attributed to the observed long-term AMU decreasing trend."

Case: We present an unusual case of Salmonella enteritidis primary bacteremia in a patient without any risk factors and originating from a region with the lowest burden of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella infections. We observed an incomplete clinical response to the treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin, despite the in vitro susceptibility of the strain. Discussion: The diagnosis of Salmonella bacteremia was far from expected in our previously healthy patient from Taiwan, without any preceding diarrhea and the lack of marked response to therapy with ceftriaxone. Making the diagnosis was a challenge, requiring wide range of laboratory, imaging, and consultative work to rule out alternative diagnoses and complications. Conclusion: Invasive Salmonella infections are uncommon in our clinical practice at the present. Air transportation, intensive migration processes, and changes in climate are able to change the burden of infectious diseases dramatically in the near future. That fact along with the raising antibacterial resistance among invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella strains make imperative the profound understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of those infections."

At the community level, Mtb transmission depends on the exposure venue, infectiousness of the tuberculosis (TB) index case and the susceptibility of the index case's social network. People living with HIV infection are at high risk of TB, yet the factors associated with TB transmission within communities with high rates of TB and HIV are largely undocumented. The primary aim of the Kopanyo study is to better understand the demographic, clinical, social and geospatial factors associated with TB and multidrug-resistant TB transmission in 2 communities in Botswana, a country where 60\% of all patients with TB are also infected with HIV. This manuscript describes the methods used in the Kopanyo study. Methods and analysis The study will be conducted in greater Gaborone, which has high rates of HIV and a mobile population; and in Ghanzi, a rural community with lower prevalence of HIV infection and home to the native San population. Kopanyo aims to enrol all persons diagnosed with TB during a 4-year study period. From each participant, sputum will be cultured, and for all Mtb isolates, molecular genotyping (24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats) will be performed. Patients with matching genotype results will be considered members of a genotype cluster, a proxy for recent transmission. Demographic, behavioural, clinical and social information will be collected by interview. Participant residence, work place, healthcare facilities visited and social gathering venues will be geocoded. We will assess relationships between these factors and cluster involvement to better plan interventions for reducing TB transmission.

A further difference between sensitive and dependent mutants was the production by the latter of lactic acid when the gas phase was changed from air to nitrogen. Resistant cultures grown in antibiotic-free medium were similar to sensitive cultures, but when dihydrostreptomycin was added, the resistant organism produced lactic and pyruvic acids. Three strains of streptomycin-sensitive E. coli accumulated pyruvic acid from glucose oxidation in the presence of concentrations of dihydrostreptomycin which inhibited multiplication. Further evidence is thus provided to implicate reactions of pyruvate as being of significance in the mechanism of action of streptomycin."

We modelled the plausible effect of rapidly available infection control strategies on the overall course of the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in a rural area of South Africa. Methods We investigated the effect of administrative, environmental, and personal infection control measures on the epidemic trajectory of XDR tuberculosis in the rural community of Tugela Ferry. Assessments were done with a mathematical model incorporating over 2 years of longitudinal inpatient and community-based data. The model simulated inpatient airborne tuberculosis transmission, community tuberculosis transmission, and the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy. Findings If no new interventions are introduced, about 1300 cases of XDR tuberculosis are predicted to occur in the area of Tugela Ferry by the end of 2012, more than half of which are likely to be nosocomially transmitted. Mask use alone would avert fewer than 10\% of cases in the overall epidemic, but could prevent a large proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis in hospital staff. The combination of mask use with reduced hospitalisation time and a shift to outpatient therapy could prevent nearly a third of XDR tuberculosis cases. Supplementing this approach with improved ventilation, rapid drug resistance testing, HIV treatment, and tuberculosis isolation facilities could avert 48\% of XDR tuberculosis cases (range 34-50\%) by the end of 2012. However, involuntary detention could result in an unexpected rise in incidence due to restricted isolation capacity. Interpretation A synergistic combination of available nosocomial infection control strategies could prevent nearly half of XDR tuberculosis cases, even in a resource-limited setting. XDR tuberculosis transmission will probably continue in the community, indicating the need to develop and implement parallel community-based programmes."

This protein was characterized by chemical, biochemical, and biological analyses. By using gel filtration, the molecular mass of SAP was estimated to be 160 kDa. Structural analysis of SAP by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry suggested that SAP is composed of three heterologous protein subunits of 41.7 kDa (SAP1), 21.7 kDa (SAP2), and 18.7 kDa (SAP3) at a molar ratio of 1:1:5 (or 1:1:6). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and a homology search revealed that SAP1, SAP2, and SAP3 exhibit 64.3, 68.4, and 86.7% similarity to three Streptomyces coelicolor polypeptides, puromycin resistance protein (Pur8), a conserved hypothetical protein, and bacterioferritin, respectively. The MIC of purified SAP against Pythium porphyrae was determined to be 1.6 microg/disk, whereas no inhibitory effect was observed at concentrations up to 100 microg/disk against most of the fungal and bacterial strains tested; the only exception was relatively strong antifungal activity against Pythium ultimum (MIC, 6.3 microg/disk). In vitro and in vivo toxicity tests demonstrated that SAP showed no toxicity against Porphyra yezoensis cells, human normal dermal fibroblasts, and mice at doses up to 700 microg/ml (for 24 h), 250 microg/ml (for 12 h), and 75 mg/kg (for 35 days), respectively. SAP was labile when it was subjected to a heated-air drying treatment, which is a great advantage in food production procedures. These results indicated that Streptomyces sp. strain AP77 might be useful as a gene source for safe transgenic Porphyra breeding for tolerance to Pythium infection."

However, their widespread use as an additive in animal feeds has raised concerns about the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Increasingly, more microorganisms are becoming resistant to multiple antibiotics. A high proportion of the antibiotics added to animal feed is excreted in urine or manure. In some cases, as much as 90\% of the antibiotic administered orally may pass through the animal unchanged. Once excreted in urine and manure, these antibiotics can enter surface and/or groundwater through nonpoint source pollution from manure-applied lands. The literature shows that most of the antibiotics are strongly adsorbed in soils and are not readily degraded. An important environmental concern is the presence of antibiotics in sources of potable water. Except erythromycin and some sulfa drugs, most of the antibiotics found in surface waters have been only in minute quantities. In all cases, the amounts observed are in parts per billion ranges; 100- to 1000-fold below minimum inhibitory concentration. Tetracyclines and penicillins, two of the most commonly used antibiotics in animal agriculture, have seldom been found in sources of potable water. There has been some reported presence of resistant bacteria in surface waters. This may have been from transport of resistant bacteria via animal or insect vectors, in airborne dusts, or simply water flow from some antibiotic-rich setting such as manure lagoons. Direct toxic effects of antibiotics on plants and soil micro-flora and -fauna are unlikely because of the low concentrations at which antibiotics in manure are land-applied. The indirect effects of antibiotics on the food web, however, cannot be discounted at this stage. Decrease in some components of the soil microbial populations due to manure-applied antibiotics could cause loss of food sources for other soil organisms, which, in turn, could affect important soil microbial processes such as decomposition and mineralization. Also, repeated application of antibiotic-laden manure can provide an environment in which selection of anti biotic-resistant bacteria can occur. Prudent use of antibiotics to a bare minimum along with alternative methods that minimize development and proliferation of resistant bacteria need investigation. (c) 2005, Elsevier Inc."

It is well documented that bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of NO are concentration-dependent. However, few data exist comparing relative susceptibility of common pathogens to NO at physiologic concentrations. In this study we evaluated the effects of NO on 4 common airway bacteria and 1 fungus, and examined the potential implications of discrepancies in sensitivity. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans cultures were adjusted to a uniform optical density (OD) and grown in log phase at 37 degrees C with varying concentrations of NO formed by DETA NONOate. Both OD readings and colony forming units (CFUs) were measured at varying time-points to evaluate for inhibitory effects of NO. RESULTS: P aeruginosa and C albicans were significantly more sensitive to NO at physiologic concentrations typical of the human airway. S aureus was attenuated by NO to a lesser degree, and K pneumoniae and S epidermis were more resistant to NO at all concentrations tested. Air surface liquid from cultured human sinonasal epithelial cells had an additive effect in bacterial killing of P aeruginosa, but not in S aureus. CONCLUSION: Common airway pathogens have varying levels of susceptibility to NO at physiologic concentrations of innate immune defense. Relative sensitivity of P aeruginosa and relative resistance of S epidermis may help explain the composition of the healthy microbiome, as well as opportunistic infection in the absence of induced NO release."

Even as efforts to broadly implement conventional TB transmission control measures begin, current strategies may be incompletely effective under the overcrowded conditions extant in high-burden, resource-limited settings. Longstanding evidence suggesting that TB patients on effective therapy rapidly become non-infectious and that unsuspected, untreated TB cases account for the most transmission makes a strong case for the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostics coupled with fully supervised effective treatment. Among the most important decisions affecting transmission, the choice of an MDR-TB treatment model that includes community-based treatment may offer important advantages over hospital or clinic-based care, not only in cost and effectiveness, but also in transmission control. In the community, too, rapid identification of infectious cases, especially drug-resistant cases, followed by effective, fully supervised treatment, is critical to stopping transmission. Among the conventional interventions available, we present a simple triage and separation strategy, point out that separation is intimately linked to the design and engineering of clinical space and call attention to the pros and cons of natural ventilation, simple mechanical ventilation systems, germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection, fit-tested respirators on health care workers and short-term use of masks on patients before treatment is initiated."

The proposed mechanism by which Trichoderma spp. antagonizes phytopathogens is through the release of lytic enzymes, antimicrobial compounds, mycoparasitism, and the induction of systemic disease-resistance in plants. Here we analyzed the role of TGF-1 (Trichoderma Gcn Five-1), a histone acetyltransferase of Trichoderma atroviride, in mycoparasitism and antibiosis against the phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that promotes histone acetylation, slightly affected T. atroviride and R. solani growth, but not the growth of the mycoparasite over R. solani. Application of TSA to the liquid medium induced synthesis of antimicrobial compounds. Expression analysis of the mycoparasitism-related genes ech-42 and prb-1, which encode an endochitinase and a proteinase, as well as the secondary metabolism-related genes pbs-1 and tps-1, which encode a peptaibol synthetase and a terpene synthase, respectively, showed that they were regulated by TSA. A T. atroviride strain harboring a deletion of tgf-1 gene showed slow growth, thinner and less branched hyphae than the wild-type strain, whereas its ability to coil around the R. solani hyphae was not affected. Deltatgf-1 presented a diminished capacity to grow over R. solani, but the ability of its mycelium -free culture filtrates (MFCF) to inhibit the phytopathogen growth was enhanced. Intriguingly, addition of TSA to the culture medium reverted the enhanced inhibition growth of Deltatgf-1 MFCF on R. solani at levels compared to the wild-type MFCF grown in medium amended with TSA. The presence of R. solani mycelium in the culture medium induced similar proteinase activity in a Deltatgf-1 compared to the wild-type, whereas the chitinolytic activity was higher in a Deltatgf-1 mutant in the absence of R. solani, compared to the parental strain. Expression of mycoparasitism- and secondary metabolism-related genes in Deltatgf-1 was differentially regulated in the presence or absence of R. solani. These results indicate that histone acetylation may play important roles in the biocontrol mechanisms of T. atroviride."

The New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase 1 gene is hypothesized to have originated in India, with subsequent dissemination by colonized or infected travelers. Method: We conducted an ecological study evaluating the association between the cumulative air traffic departing India between 2007 and 2012 and published cases of NDM-1. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated as well as multivariate logistic regression models. 193 countries with complete flight and World Bank data were included in the analysis. Results: Receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) of the dichotomous outcome of a published case of NDM-1 were generated, yielding an unadjusted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and adjusted AUC of 0.85. The unadjusted odds ratio of having a reported case of NDM-1, for every percentage increase in cumulative air traffic departing India, was 2.3 (95\% CI 1.4 to 3.7) and adjusted was 2.0 (95\% CI 1.2 to 3.4). Conclusions: We demonstrate that flows of international travelers departing India by air is associated with published NDM-1 cases, globally. Countries with high passenger flight traffic from India with no reported cases of NDM-1 may be at increased risk of having unreported transmission of NDM-1. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the eradication of risk factors for outbreak of fungal infections, and the usage of appropriate antifungal agents are universally important to prevent these infections. For infections due to intrinsic fungi such as Candida spp., risk factors such as changes in normal flora by aggressive and prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy should not be permitted to emerge. On the other hand, infections due to extrinsic fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus spp. can be prevented by eradication of the colonized fungi using antifungal prophylaxis and the use of air-cleaning machines to combat colonization of patients and contamination in the hospital environment. The most important risk factor of fungal infections in patients suffering from haematologic malignancies is leukopenia. In these cases, it is crucial to reduce the duration of neutropenia and enhance the anti-microbial function using granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor. When a patient is complicated with a fungal infection, appropriate antifungal agents must be used at appropriate dosages for the appropriate period. However, there are still very few satisfactory antifungals with minimal adverse effects and good potential efficacy for systemic fungal infections. Therefore, combination therapy with amphotericin B and azole antifungals is necessary for patients with severe fungal infections. In patients complicated with fungal infections, the underlying disease is often resistant to aggressive antifungal therapy. Control of this underlying disease is thus a most important therapeutic factor."

First published January 14, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00334.2010.-Our goal was to quantify mitochondrial and plasma potential (Delta psi(m) and Delta psi(p)) based on the disposition of rhodamine 123 (R123) or tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) in the medium surrounding pulmonary endothelial cells. Dyes were added to the medium, and their concentrations in extracellular medium ({[}R(e)]) were measured over time. R123 {[}R(e)] fell from 10 nM to 6.6 +/- 0.1 (SE) nM over 120 min. TMRE {[}R(e)] fell from 20 nM to a steady state of 4.9 +/- 0.4 nM after similar to 30 min. Protonophore or high K(+) concentration ({[}K(+)]), used to manipulate contributions of membrane potentials, attenuated decreases in {[}R(e)], and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibition had the opposite effect, demonstrating the qualitative impact of these processes on {[}R(e)]. A kinetic model incorporating a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz model was fit to {[}R(e)] vs. time data for R123 and TMRE, respectively, under various conditions to obtain (means +/- 95\% confidence intervals) Delta psi(m) (-130 +/- 7 and -133 +/- 4 mV), Delta psi(p) (-36 +/- 4 and -49 +/- 4 mV), and a Pgp activity parameter (K(Pgp), 25 +/- 5 and 51 +/- 11 mu l/min). The higher membrane permeability of TMRE also allowed application of steady-state analysis to obtain Delta psi(m) (-124 +/- 6 mV). The consistency of kinetic parameter values obtained from R123 and TMRE data demonstrates the utility of this experimental and theoretical approach for quantifying intact cell Delta psi(m) and Delta psi(p). Finally, steady-state analysis revealed that although room air-and hyperoxia-exposed (95\% O(2) for 48 h) cells have equivalent resting Delta psi(m), hyperoxic cell Delta psi(m) was more sensitive to depolarization with protonophore, consistent with previous observations of pulmonary endothelial hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction."

In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which methanol stimulates the antibacterial resistance of ``receiver{''} plants, we constructed forward and reverse suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries from Nicotiana benthamiana plants exposed to methanol. We identified multiple methanol-inducible genes (MIGs), most of which are involved in defense or cell-to-cell trafficking. We then isolated the most affected genes for further analysis: beta-1,3-glucanase (BG), a previously unidentified gene (MIG-21), and non-cell-autonomous pathway protein (NCAPP). Experiments with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and a vector encoding two tandem copies of green fluorescent protein as a tracer of cell-to-cell movement showed the increased gating capacity of plasmodesmata in the presence of BG, MIG-21, and NCAPP. The increased gating capacity is accompanied by enhanced TMV reproduction in the ``receivers{''}.

However, traditional microbiological culture-based methods are limited, particularly in their ability to provide timely data. The present review discusses the reasons for the increasing interest in rapid methods; current developments in the field, the research needs, and the future trends. The advent of biotechnology has introduced new technologies that led to the emergence of rapid diagnostic methods and altered food testing practices. Rapid methods are comprised of many different detection technologies, including specialized enzyme substrates, antibodies and DNA, ranging from simple differential plating media to the use of sophisticated instruments. The use of non-invasive sampling techniques for live animals especially came into focus with the 1990s outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that was linked to the human outbreak of Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease. Serology is still an important tool in preventing foodborne pathogens to enter the human food supply through meat and milk from animals. One of the primary uses of rapid methods is for fast screening of large number of samples, where most of them are expected to be test-negative, leading to faster product release for sale. This has been the main strength of rapid methods such as real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Enrichment PCR, where a primary culture broth is tested in PCR, is the most common approach in rapid testing. Recent reports show that it is possible both to enrich a sample and enumerate by pathogen-specific real-time PCR, if the enrichment time is short. This can be especially useful in situations where food producers ask for the level of pathogen in a contaminated product. Another key issue is automation, where the key drivers are miniaturization and multiple testing, which mean that not only one instrument is flexible enough to test for many pathogens but also many pathogens can be detected with one test. The review is mainly based on the author's scientific work that has contributed with the following new developments to this field: (i) serologic tests for large-scale screening, surveillance, or eradication programs, (ii) same-day detection of Salmonella that otherwise was considered as difficult to achieve, (iii) pathogen enumeration following a short log-phase enrichment, (iv) detection of foodborne pathogens in air samples, and finally (v) biotracing of pathogens based on mathematical modeling, even in the absence of isolate. Rapid methods are discussed in a broad global health perspective, international food supply, and for improvement of quantitative microbial risk assessments. The need for quantitative sample preparation techniques, culture-independent, metagenomic-based detection, online monitoring, a global validation infrastructure has been emphasized. The cost and ease of use of rapid assays remain challenging obstacles to surmount."

The objective of this study was to determine the ability of 2 supplementation programs with a commercial beta-1,3/1,6-glucan product to protect broiler chicks from experimental respiratory challenge with Escherichia coli. Chicks were housed in battery-brooders from 1 d of age and fed a standard starter diet or the same diet containing 20 g/ton (22 ppm) of purified beta-1,3/1,6-glucan either continuously (BG25d) or for only the first 7 d prior to challenge (BG7d). At d 7 one-half of the birds were inoculated in the thoracic air sac with 800 cfu of a serotype O2, nonmotile strain of E. coli. All surviving birds were necropsied at d 25. Body weight of survivors and feed conversion efficiency were protected from the adverse effects of E. coli challenge by BG7d but not by BG25d. Mortality was nominally decreased from 63\% (control) to 53\% in BG25d and 47\% in BG7d, but these decreases were not significant. The relative weights of the liver and heart were increased, and the bursa of Fabricius relative weights were decreased by E. coli challenge, and these effects were modulated by beta-glucan treatment. Despite positive effects of BG7d in E. coli-challenged birds, the BW of nonchallenged birds was decreased by BG7d and BG25d. These results suggest that supplementation of broiler diets with beta-1,3/1,6-glucan may be valuable for decreasing production losses due to E. coli respiratory disease, but that the immune stimulation provided may also result in decreased production values under experimental battery conditions or for birds raised in an environment with minimal disease challenges."

While molecular tools are transforming the diagnostic processes, especially for multi-drug-resistant (MDR)-TB, drug development and service provision for MDR-TB seriously lag behind. Inappropriate management of detected MDR-TB cases may amplify drug resistance, jeopardizing future control. Targeted screening and treatment of latent infection with M.tuberculosis with the currently available immunodiagnostic tools and treatment regimens aim more for personal protection than major epidemiological impact or elimination. The interferon- release assays (IGRA) are not affected by cross-reaction to the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and are increasingly used for such screening before initiation of biologics for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders. BCG offers only partial and unreliable protection against pulmonary TB in adults, the crucial transmission link for this airborne infection. Systems biology and vaccinomics may speed up vaccine research. The successful development of a fully effective TB vaccine that targets both growing bacteria and non-growing persisters may reflect a major breakthrough, as natural infection does not induce sufficient immunity to prevent reinfection."

Disruption of bslA resulted in the loss of surface repellency and altered the biofilm surface microstructure. BslA localized to the biofilm matrix in an exopolysaccharide-dependent manner. Purified BslA exhibited amphiphilic properties and formed polymers in response to increases in the area of the air-water interface in vitro. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that the self-polymerization activity of BslA was essential for its ability to localize to the biofilm matrix.

Understanding epidemiology and disease transmission is vital to nursing care. Infectious disease transmission requires three components: an agent (virus, bacterium, parasite or other microbe), a vulnerable host and a conducive environment. Disease spread can occur through direct contact or via indirect methods (airborne droplets, vectors, fomites, water or food). Intervention can occur by attacking the agent (e.g., using microbicides), changing the environment (e.g., providing negative pressure rooms) or strengthening the host (e.g., vaccination). Three epidemiologically relevant microbes are the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). The first is an emerging pathogen, and the latter two are existing agents that have mutated such that they are resistant to their standard treatments. For SARS, control measures include screening for possible cases and appropriate triage, respiratory and barrier precautions within the healthcare facility, and voluntary isolation in the community for contacts or healthcare workers who exhibit symptoms. Control measures for MRSA include the screening of patient lesions, isolating or cohorting patients who are already infected, covering wounds with impermeable dressings, treating staff and patient carriers with antibiotics, and improved hygiene. Control measures for C. difficile Control measures include paying close attention to the hygiene of the clinical setting, disinfecting using bleach and the isolation of infected patients."

It is the most important cause of bacterial pneumonia in infancy, childhood and adult life, and the most important cause of meningitis in all age groups except children of 3 months to 2 years in whom Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) predominates (in the absence of Hib vaccination). Antibodies to the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule are protective, and at present 90 capsular serotypes are recognized. The global burden of pneumococcal disease is poorly understood. II is believed to be responsible for 1-2 million deaths among children under 5 years of age every year and probably a similar number among adults. Thus, the global burden of pneumonia in adults is probably significantly underestimated at present. Strategies for the control of pneumococcal disease include control of risk factors, treatment of established cases and vaccination. In children, improved nutrition, better housing and reduced indoor air pollution are difficult to address, but should eventually reduce pneumonia rates. In adults, the risk factors are even more difficult to address, although control of alcohol and tobacco consumption and reduced transmission of HIV should all affect pneumococcal disease rates. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci are now widespread throughout the world. Where penicillin resistance occurs, penicillin should not be used to treat pneumococcal meningitis; however, penicillin, at higher doses if necessary, remains the drug of choice for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia, even where penicillin resistance is prevalent. There are three approaches to pneumococcal vaccination: polysaccharide vaccines (covering 23 serotypes), polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines (covering 9-11 serotypes) and common protein vaccines (which are not serotype-specific). Only polysaccharide vaccines are available now, but conjugate vaccines will be available soon. Polysaccharide vaccines probably have a role in protecting the elderly from pneumococcal disease, especially those at high risk. The potential role of conjugate vaccines in infants is unclear.

Formation of the membrane is monitored by an increase of the electrical capacity, as measured with a voltage clamp. Electrical resistance of the unmodified membrane is analogous to that of conventional planar bilayers (black lipid membranes) prepared in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent, i.e., 10(6)-10(8) ohm cm(2); the resistance can be lowered to values of 10(3) ohm cm(2) by gramicidin, an antibiotic that modifies the conductance only when the membranes are of biomolecular thickness. In contrast to the resistance, there is a significant difference between the capacity of bilayers made from mono-layers and that of hydrocarbon-containing bilayers made by phase transition; the average values are 0.9 and 0.45 muF cm(-2), respectively. The value of 0.9 muF cm(-2) approximates that of biological membranes. Assuming a dielectric constant of 2.1 for the hydrocarbon region, the dielectric thickness, as calculated from a capacity of 0.9 muF cm(-2), is 22 A. This value is 6-10 A smaller than the actual thickness of the hydrocarbon region of bilayers and cell membranes, as determined by x-ray diffraction. The difference may be due to a limited penetration of water into the hydrocarbon region near the ester groups that would lower the electrical resistance of this region and reduce the dielectric thickness. Asymmetric membranes have been formed by adjoining two lipid monolayers of different chemical composition."

Methods and Results: Enterococcus spp. (n = 16) and Streptococcus spp. (n =16) were analysed using DNA-DNA hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and oligoprobing of PCR products. All isolates carried multiple MLS resistance genes, while 50\% of the Enterococcus spp. and 44\% of the Streptococcus spp. also carried multiple tet resistance genes. All Enterococcus spp. carried erm(A) and erm(B), 69\% carried erm(F), 44\% carried mef(A), 75\% carried tet(M), 69\% carried tet(L) and 19\% carried tet(K). All Streptococcus spp. carried erm(B), 94\% carried erm(F), 75\% carried erm(A), 38\% carried mef(A), 50\% carried tet(M), 81\% carried tet(L) and 13\% carried tet(K). Conclusions: Multidrug resistance among airborne bacteria recovered from a swine operation is encoded by multiple MLS and tet resistance genes. These are the first data regarding resistance gene carriage among airborne bacteria from swine-feeding operations.

AmB autooxidizes, and it is possible that its antifungal effects could result from oxidative damage. Exposure of protoplasts of Candida albicans to AmB under hypoxic conditions reduced protoplast lysis by as much as 80% compared with incubations in air. Protoplasts were protected from AmB-induced lysis by exogenous catalase and/or superoxide dismutase (SOD). Whole cells of C. albicans were protected by exogenous catalase from AmB-induced leakage of [3H]leucine and from killing by AmB. Cells grown on medium inducing high levels of endogenous catalase were resistant to AmB-induced growth inhibition. In contrast, AmB-induced K+ leakage was not hindered under hypoxic conditions or in the presence of catalase or SOD. Thus the lethal and lytic effects of AmB on C. albicans cells and protoplasts, but not prelethal AmB-induced K+ leakage, are mediated by oxidative damage."

Thus, it is necessary to develop techniques to effectively inactivate microorganisms present in the air of WWTPs facilities. In the present work, ultraviolet light A radiation was used as inactivation tool. The microbial population was not visibly reduced in the bioaerosol by ultraviolet light A (UVA) photolysis. The UVA photocatalytic process for the inactivation of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi, ATCC strains and isolates from indoor air samples of a WWTP) using titanium dioxide (TiO2 P25) and zinc oxide (ZnO) was tested in both liquid-phase and airborne conditions. In the slurry conditions at liquid phase, P25 showed a better performance in inactivation. For this reason, gas-phase assays were performed in a tubular photoreactor packed with cellulose acetate monolithic structures coated with P25. The survival rate of microorganisms under study decreased with the catalyst load and the UVA exposure time. Inactivation of fungi was slower than resistant bacteria, followed by Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria."

DESIGN: Infection control (IC) and TB coordinators obtained cost information on tuberculin skin-test (TST) programs, addition of IC and employee health service (EHS) personnel, and the retrofit or new construction of environmental controls. SETTING: Four hospitals with, and one community hospital without, prior nosocomial multidrug-resistant TB transmission. RESULTS: During the study period, the TST program costs remained constant at four of five hospitals and increased at one hospital (median 1994 TST program cost: \$5,568; range, \$2,393-\$44,902). Additional IC or EHS personnel were hired at four of five hospitals (median cost increase, \$125,500; range, \$63,000-\$228,000). The median cost of new construction or new equipment purchases (ie, sputum induction booths, ultraviolet lights, or portable high-efficiency particulate air filters) at study hospitals was \$163,000 (range, \$45,000-\$524,000) and \$70,000 (range, \$31,000-\$93,000), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Costs associated with implementing control measures similar to those recommended in the CDC TB IC guidelines varied widely by hospital. Engineering controls involved the largest capital outlay, but increases in personnel were the largest continuing cost.

Here, we investigated whether the susceptibility of a nosocomial infection-related microbe, Acinetobacter baumannii, to strong sampling stress caused by Nuclepore filter changes as it develops resistance to a drug called colistin. Both colistin-sensitive A. baumannii (CSAB) and colistin-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) are generally desiccation-resistant strains that can be collected by filter sampling. However, the resistance of CRAB to the three combined stresses (aerosolization, impaction, and desiccation) caused by filter sampling was 1.8 times lower than that of CSAB (P < 0.05). The sampling stresses caused by filter sampling not only reduced the culturability of A. baumannii but also destroyed proteins to result in cellular protein leakage. CRAB released 17%-38% more extracellular protein than did CSAB when they were both subjected to desiccation stress for 240 minutes (P < 0.01). The combination of using a sampling flow rate of 20 L/min and sampling for 60 minutes with a Nuclepore filter with open-face cassettes (OFCs) is recommended for collecting airborne A. baumannii.

ADR is a quinone-containing anthracycline chemotherapeutic and is known to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in heart. Application of this drug can have serious side effects in various tissues, including brain, apart from the known cardiotoxic side effects, which limit the successful use of this drug in treatment of cancer. Neurons treated with ADR demonstrate significant protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation. Patients under treatment with this drug often complain of forgetfulness, lack of concentration, dizziness (collectively called somnolence or sometimes called chemobrain). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ADR induces oxidative stress in brain. Accordingly, we examined the in vivo levels of brain protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation induced by i.p. injection of ADR. We also measured levels of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (AIR) in brain isolated from ADRP1 or saline-injected mice. MRP1 mediates ATP-dependent export of cytotoxic organic anions, glutathione S-conjugates and sulphates. The current results demonstrated a significant increase in levels of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and increased expression of MRP1 in brain isolated from mice, 72 h post i.p injection of ADR. These results are discussed with reference to potential use of this redox cycling chemotheraputic agent in the treatement of cancer and its chemobrain side effect in brain."

The shelter provides evening accommodations for men aged 50 yr and older.  The capacity is approximately 200 clients, and the client pool is approximately 1,000 men/yr.  During a 6-wk period in December 1986 and January 1987, seven cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed in shelter clients.  Nine cases were reported in clients during the preceding 12 months, and four cases in the year previous to that.  The majority of outbreak cases were pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum smear positive.  Drug resistance was rare.  Phage typing of 15 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates revealed one predominant type and four other types.  The goals of the control plan (and the steps taken to achieve them) were to render known infectious cases noninfectious (directly observed therapy); to find undiagnosed infectious cases (repetitive mass screenings); to protect exposed clients (repetitive tuberculin skin testing and isoniazid preventive therapy); and to make the shelter environment safe (exclude infectious, noncompliant clients and improve the shelter's ventilation system).  Implementation of this plan rapidly terminated the outbreak; following the first mass screening in January 1987, at which six asymptomatic cases were detected, only five additional cases occurred in shelter clients during a 2-yr period of follow-up.  The investigation suggested that the outbreak evolved during 1986 as a result of the presence at the shelter of an increasing number of men with undiagnosed infectious pulmonary tuberculosis. Factors favoring disease transmission at the shelter were a relatively stable client pool, of which many were susceptible to tuberculosis; close proximity of bedding; and a closed ventilation system that provided extensive air recirculation during the winter months.  Clients with prior tuberculosis infection and disease were not protected from involvement in this outbreak.  The study suggests that at emergency shelters with a pattern of regular client usage, a program of ongoing tuberculosis control should be implemented to detect endemic cases, to limit the pool of clients with undiagnosed, infectious tuberculosis, and to prevent such outbreaks."

Yet, formidable challenges exist in generating complete descriptions of how the parts function and assemble into macromolecular complexes and whole-cell assemblies. Bacterial biofilms are complex multicellular bacterial communities protected by a slime-like extracellular matrix that confers protection to environmental stress and enhances resistance to antibiotics and host defenses. As a non-crystalline, insoluble, heterogeneous assembly, the biofilm extracellular matrix poses a challenge to compositional analysis by conventional methods. In this perspective, bottom-up and topdown solid-state NMR approaches are described for defining chemical composition in complex macrosystems. The ``sum-of-the-parts{''} bottom-up approach was introduced to examine the amyloid-integrated biofilms formed by Escherichia coli and permitted the first determination of the composition of the intact extracellular matrix from a bacterial biofilm. An alternative top-down approach was developed to define composition in Vibrio cholerae biofilms and relied on an extensive panel of NMR measurements to tease out specific carbon pools from a single sample of the intact extracellular matrix. These two approaches are widely applicable to other heterogeneous assemblies. For bacterial biofilms, quantitative parameters of matrix composition are needed to understand how biofilms are assembled, to improve the development of biofilm inhibitors, and to dissect inhibitor modes of action. Solid-state NMR approaches will also be invaluable in obtaining parameters of matrix architecture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Patients and methods: This study was performed from July 2010 to May 2011. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae were counted in environmental samples (air and surfaces) that were obtained in the rooms of patients with wounds colonized (cases, n = 9) or not (controls, n = 15) during or not during wound dressing change. Bacterial contamination was compared to that found in the rooms of patients without colonized wounds. Results: The environment was frequently contaminated during wound dressing change (38\% of the sampled series were positive). In comparison, the contamination was less frequent in the environment of patients with colonized wounds when the wounds were not being dressed (14.3\%) and in controls (3.8\%). S. aureus was the most frequent species identified in positive samples. Discussion: These results suggest that previously recommended measures such as hand hygiene after contact with the environment and wearing a mask are justified. Moreover, other measures should be suggested, in particular cleaning the room before and after dressing change of colonized wounds. Level of evidence: Level III: case control study.

In the United States, a low-prevalence country for TB, recent outbreaks of drug-resistant disease among caregivers and HIV-infected persons in institutional settings stimulated comprehensive national guidelines to prevent transmission. These included detailed engineering recommendations for TB isolation and procedure rooms, such as ventilation, directional airflow, HEPA filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). However, current guidelines suggest few interventions to prevent transmission from unsuspected cases who are not in isolation, widely believed to be the greatest source of airborne spread in congregate settings. In high-prevalence countries, institutional TB transmission has only recently been recognized as a serious problem. Extremely limited resources for infection control in high-prevalence countries, as in homeless shelters in the United States, have underscored the need for low-cost methods of air disinfection that are applicable throughout high-risk facilities, not just in isolation rooms. UVGI may be the most cost-effective technology for these and other settings, but additional research and improved engineering guidelines are needed for its optimal application.  1997 ASHRAE."

Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are associated with considerable physiologic deterioration and increased airway inflammation. About half of COPD exacerbations are caused or triggered primarily by bacterial and viral infections (colds, especially from rhinovirus), but air pollution can contribute to the beginning of an exacerbation. Type 1 exacerbations involve increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; Type 2 exacerbations involve any two of the latter symptoms, and Type 3 exacerbations involve one of those symptoms combined with cough, wheeze, or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. Exacerbations are more common than previously believed (2.5-3 exacerbations per year); many exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. We found that about half of exacerbations were unreported by the patients, despite considerable encouragement to do so, and, instead, were only diagnosed from patients' diary cards. COPD patients are accustomed to frequent symptom changes, and this may explain their tendency to underreport exacerbations. COPD patients tend to be anxious and depressed about the disease and some might not seek treatment. At the beginning of an exacerbation physiologic changes such as decreases in peak flow and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) are usually small and therefore are not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger decreases in peak flow are associated with dyspnea and the presence of symptomatic upper-respiratory viral infection. More pronounced physiologic changes during exacerbation are related to longer exacerbation recovery time. Dyspnea, common colds, sore throat, and cough increase significantly during prodrome, indicating that respiratory viruses are important exacerbation triggers. However, the prodrome is relatively short and not useful in predicting onset. As colds are associated with longer and more severe exacerbations, a COPD patient who develops a cold should be considered for early therapy. Physiologic recovery after an exacerbation is often incomplete, which decreases health-related quality of life and resistance to future exacerbations, so it is important to identify COPD patients who suffer frequent exacerbations and to convince them to take precautions to minimize the risk of colds and other exacerbation triggers. Exacerbation frequency may vary with the severity of the COPD. Exacerbation frequency may or may not increase with the severity of the COPD. As the COPD progresses, exacerbations tend to have more symptoms and take longer to recover from. Twenty-five to fifty percent of COPD patients suffer lower airway bacteria colonization, which is related to the severity of COPD and cigarette smoking and which begins a cycle of epithelial cell damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, mucus hypersecretion, increased submucosal vascular leakage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Elevated sputum interleukin-8 levels are associated with higher bacterial load and faster FEV(1) decline; the bacteria increase airway inflammation in the stable patient, which may accelerate disease progression. A 2-week course of oral corticosteroids is as beneficial as an 8-week course, with fewer adverse effects, and might extend the time until the next exacerbation. Antibiotics have some efficacy in treating exacerbations. Exacerbation frequency increases with progressive airflow obstruction; so patients with chronic respiratory failure are particularly susceptible to exacerbation."

After autopsy, specimens were collected from air bags of carcasses using sterile swaps and transferred immediately to the laboratory. After microbiological culture, the isolates were confirmed by the conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. Antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli isolates were determined by disk diffusion method. Results: Out of 200 specimens, 100 (50%) E. coli isolates were identified and confirmed by PCR method.

RECENT FINDINGS: Both morbidity and mortality are associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thus, clinicians are attempting eradication strategies for MRSA using combinations of oral, aerosolized, intravenous, and topical antibiotics, with some success. However, household contacts may be colonized with MRSA, which can impact the durability of eradication. Epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also associated with increased morbidity and mortality and some clones are detected in CF patients throughout the world presumably due to social networks among patients. Recent experimental and clinical data have suggested that CF patients can generate droplet nuclei in the respirable range and that infectious particles can be cultured from room air minutes to hours after patients have left. SUMMARY: Although these observations regarding droplet nuclei have not been linked to transmission, they do challenge the safety of the '3-foot rule' and suggest the potential role of masks. Additional research is needed to develop strategies to improve infection control practices among healthcare professionals, CF patients, and families."

Laboratory based microbiological tests such as the disc diffusion assay and the determination of rrunimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using the broth dilution method, confirmed that the sunflower extracts from our four study sites gave varying, degrees of antibacterial activity ranging from partially active, to active, against both gram negative and gram positive test microorganisms. Results of qualitative phytochemical screening of T. diversifolia leaf extracts from the study sites revealed the presence of steroids, saponins, tannins and polyphones as well as alkaloids which might be responsible for this broad antibacterial activity. However, our statistical analyses revealed a general trend that the antibacterial activity of the plant extract from BGH, the site most exposed to vehicular emissions was significantly higher than the rest of the plant extracts used in this study. Interestingly, the extracts from BGH and UP Drive, the sites more exposed to vehicular traffic were the extracts that were positive for alkaloids.

Based on these results, it might be that factors like geographical location along with pollution exposure have an effect on the antibacterial property of the wild sunflower plant.

Effective TB infection control measures are urgently needed. We evaluated the efficacy of upper-room ultraviolet (UV) lights and negative air ionization for preventing airborne TB transmission using a guinea pig air-sampling model to measure the TB infectiousness of ward air. Methods and Findings For 535 consecutive days, exhaust air from an HIV-TB ward in Lima, Peru, was passed through three guinea pig air-sampling enclosures each housing approximately 150 guinea pigs, using a 2-d cycle. On UV-off days, ward air passed in parallel through a control animal enclosure and a similar enclosure containing negative ionizers. On UV-on days, UV lights and mixing fans were turned on in the ward, and a third animal enclosure alone received ward air. TB infection in guinea pigs was defined by monthly tuberculin skin tests. All guinea pigs underwent autopsy to test for TB disease, defined by characteristic autopsy changes or by the culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from organs. 35\% (106/304) of guinea pigs in the control group developed TB infection, and this was reduced to 14\% (43/303) by ionizers, and to 9.5\% (29/307) by UV lights (both p < 0.0001 compared with the control group). TB disease was confirmed in 8.6\% (26/304) of control group animals, and this was reduced to 4.3\% (13/303) by ionizers, and to 3.6\% (11/307) by UV lights (both p < 0.03 compared with the control group). Time-to-event analysis demonstrated that TB infection was prevented by ionizers (log-rank 27; p < 0.0001) and by UV lights (log-rank 46; p < 0.0001). Time-to-event analysis also demonstrated that TB disease was prevented by ionizers (log-rank 3.7; p=0.055) and by UV lights (log-rank 5.4; p=0.02). An alternative analysis using an airborne infection model demonstrated that ionizers prevented 60\% of TB infection and 51\% of TB disease, and that UV lights prevented 70\% of TB infection and 54\% of TB disease. In all analysis strategies, UV lights tended to be more protective than ionizers. Conclusions Upper-room UV lights and negative air ionization each prevented most airborne TB transmission detectable by guinea pig air sampling. Provided there is adequate mixing of room air, upper-room UV light is an effective, low-cost intervention for use in TB infection control in high-risk clinical settings."

Recent studies suggest that these proteins have a direct effect on the growth and viability of Gram-negative bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Histoplasma capsulatum. METHODOLOGY: The researchers examined membrane permeabilization by BAL fluid of mice that were sufficient or deficient in surfactant proteins, of rough and smooth LPS-containing membranes, and of genetically altered bacteria. The permeability assay is based on the ability of agents to promote access of impermeable dyes propidium iodide and ELF97 to intracellular targets. RESULTS: The permeabilizing activity of concentrated BAL material from SP-A+/+ mice was substantially greater than that from SP-A-/- animals, and was sensitive to hyperoxic exposure. Oxidation of the collectins in vitro also blocked their antimicrobial effects. Rough but not smooth LPS conferred susceptibility of model bacterial membranes to permeabilization by the collectins. The screening of genetically engineered SP-A mice with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa signature tagged mutagenesis library has revealed several pathways which are required for resistance to the permeabilizing effects of SP-A, including those required for salicylate biosynthesis and flagellar function. CONCLUSION: The researchers conclude that the pulmonary collectins directly permeabilize bacteria in an LPS-dependent and rough LPS-specific manner.

This is especially accounting for treatment of bacterial infection of chronic wounds. Plasma can be generated with different carrier gases causing various biological effects. Screening of different carrier gases and plasma generation setups is therefore needed to find suitable compositions for highly effective antimicrobial plasma treatments and other applications. METHOD: The plasma source used was a radio-frequency plasma jet which generates tissue tolerable plasma (TTP). The study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of air, argon, or helium plasma alone or admixed with 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% oxygen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Treatment took place in an environmentally open and delimited system. Therefore, bacteria were plated on agar and treated with plasma in a punctiform manner. The resulting inhibition zones were measured and the reduction factors were calculated by colony counting, respectively. RESULTS: For S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, inhibition zones and overall reduction of colony forming units (CFU) on the agar plate were observed while an accumulative reduction of CFU dominated for S. aureus. The highest antimicrobial effect was shown in form of an inhibition zone for argon plasma with 0.1% oxygen admixture for both species. S. aureus was more sensitive for helium plasma with >0.1% oxygen admixture compared to P. aeruginosa which in turn was more sensitive for argon plasma with and without oxygen. The efficacy of air plasma was very low in comparison to the other gases. The treatment in a closed system predominantly enhanced the antimicrobial effect. The effect intensity varied for each treatment time and gas mixtures. DISCUSSION: As expected, the antimicrobial effect mostly increased when increasing oxygen admixture to the carrier gases. The variation in bacterial growth and inhibition after exposure to different plasma gas compositions could be due to a varying generation of reactive oxygen species or radiation. CONCLUSION: The applied plasma in a ""closed system"" accumulates bactericidal plasma species and might increase antimicrobial efficacy in clinical settings as in wound management involving multi-drug resistant bacteria."

Because only limited data are available on the antimicrobial sensitivity of enterococci of subgingival origin, this study evaluates the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of E. faecalis isolated from periodontitis patients in the United States. Methods: Pure cultures of 47 subgingival E. faecalis clinical isolates were each inoculated onto specially prepared broth microdilution susceptibility panels containing vancomycin, teicoplanin, and six oral antibiotics of potential use in periodontal therapy. After incubation in ambient air for 18 to 20 hours, minimal inhibitory drug concentrations were determined using applicable Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria and interpretative guidelines. The organisms were additionally evaluated for in vitro resistance to metronidazole at 4 mg/mL. Results: Periodontal E. faecalis exhibited substantial in vitro resistance to tetracycline (53.2\% resistant), erythromycin (80.8\% resistant or intermediate resistant), clindamycin (100\% resistant to 2 mg/mL), and metronidazole (100\% resistant to 4 mg/mL). In comparison, the clinical isolates were generally sensitive to ciprofloxacin (89.4\% susceptible; 10.6\% intermediate resistant) and 100\% susceptible in vitro to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, vancomycin, and teicoplanin. Conclusions: Tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole revealed poor in vitro activity against human subgingival E. faecalis clinical isolates, and would likely be ineffective therapeutic agents against these species in periodontal pockets. Among orally administered antibiotics, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin exhibited marked in vitro inhibitory activity against periodontal E. faecalis, and may be clinically useful in treatment of periodontal infections involving enterococci."

A synthetic PCB mixture containing these congeners was administered orally to female FVB or mdr1a/1b knockout mice. Due to the short half-life of chiral PCB congeners, mice were euthanized after 24h and PCB concentrations and enantiomeric fractions were determined in selected tissues and excreta. Principal component analysis did not reveal differences between wild-type and mdr1a/1b knockout mice. However, Hotelling T(2)-test revealed significantly lower PCB concentrations and a more pronounced enantiomeric enrichment in the adipose tissue of mdr1a/1b knockout mice. These differences are due to higher body weights and higher fecal fat contents of mdr1a/1b knockout mice. Analysis of the enantiomeric fractions of PCBs 91, 95, 136, 149 and 174 showed a significant enantiomeric enrichment for all five congeners in wild-type and mdr1a/1b knockout mice.

In patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis who are hospitalized or reside in congregate settings, guidelines recommend airborne infection isolation until sputum smear results are negative. Studies have identified factors associated with delayed sputum smear and culture conversion in patients with tuberculosis. Because these studies did not use methods of survival analysis, estimates of time to sputum smear conversion that are based on initial patient characteristics are not available. The ability to predict time to sputum smear conversion could be useful for programmatic planning and patient counseling. METHODS. We performed a cohort study using survival analysis to identify factors associated with time to sputum smear and culture conversion. We defined the time to sputum smear conversion as the time elapsed from the start of treatment to the first date of sustained conversion. RESULTS. Ninety-eight patients had sputum smear samples positive for acid-fast bacilli. Lower initial smear grade (on 1+ to 4+ scale) and absence of cavitation on chest radiograph were associated with earlier sputum smear conversion in bivariate analysis. In multiple regression analysis, initial smear grade (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95\% confidence interval, 0.35-0.57) and drug resistance (hazard ratio, 2.30; 95\% confidence interval, 1.08-4.89) remained statistically significant; a model comprising only initial smear grade performed almost as well. Predictors of sputum culture conversion were similar. CONCLUSIONS. Initial smear grade was the strongest predictor of time to sputum smear and culture conversion in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and may be a useful predictor for programmatic planning and patient counseling."

In contrast, variant 43895OW produced a smooth and white colony morphology. In this study, we show that, similar to rdar strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, strain 438950R forms large aggregates in broth cultures, firm pellicles at the air-medium interface on glass, and dense biofilms on glass and polystyrene. However, unlike S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, strain 43895OR does not stain positive for cellulose production. When strain 43895OR was fixed on agar, scanning electron microscopy showed cells expressing extracellular matrix (ECM) containing curli fibers. Strain 43895OW was devoid of any ECM or curli fibers on agar but showed expression of curli fibers during attachment to glass.

These factors include aerosol generation, particle sizes and concentrations, organism viability, infectivity and virulence, airflow and climate, and environmental sampling and analysis. The major focus on attention to engineering controls comes from recent increases in tuberculosis, particularly the multidrug-resistant varieties in the general hospital population, the severely immunocompromised, and those in at-risk and confined environments such as prisons, long-term care facilities, and shelters For the homeless. Many workers are in close contact with persons who have active, undiagnosed, or insufficiently treated tuberculosis. Additionally, patients and health care workers may be exposed to a variety of pathogenic human viruses, opportunistic fungi, and bacteria. This report therefore focuses on the nature of infectious aerosol transmission in an attempt to determine which factors can be systematically addressed to result in proven, applied engineering approaches to the control of infectious aerosols in hospital and health care facility environments. The infectious aerosols of consideration are those that are generated as particles of respirable size by both human and environmental sources and that have the capability of remaining viable and airborne for extended periods in the indoor environment. This definition precludes skin and mucous membrane exposures occurring from splashes (rather than true aerosols) of blood or body fluids containing infectious disease agents.

Acanthamoebae feed on bacteria by phagocytosis, but some bacteria are able to survive and sometimes multiply in the host, resulting in new properties of the bacteria. The intracellular growth of bacteria has been associated with enhanced environmental survival of the bacteria, increased virulence and increased resistance against antibiotic substances. The advantage of utilising free-living amoebae is that research can be carried out on non-mammalian cells as a model based on natural reality to study bacterial virulence and pathogenicity. Amoebae are easy to handle experimentally compared with mammalian cells and allow studies on host factors for host-parasite interactions. Bacteria are easily manipulated genetically, which creates the possibility of research on mutants to study bacteria-host interactions. Thus utilising this non-mammalian model can result in better understanding of interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and assist in the development of new therapeutic agents to recognise and treat infections."

The complexes primarily differed though the number of coordinating PTN(Me) ligands. The bis-substituted Ag(I) complexes revealed P, N bidentate coordination, while the only P-monocoordination of the metal center was observed for the tris-substituted systems. The bis-ligated silver compounds were observed to quickly degrade upon photoexposure or in contact with air. In contrast, the tris-ligated complexes demonstrated greater stability, in particular, a high resistance to photo-decomposition. Calculated geometry optimized models using the density functional theory method (BP86) revealed for the bis-substituted PTN(Me) Ag(I) species that the total enthalpy of the tetrahedral C2-symmetric structure is marginally lower by -0.6 kcal mol(-1) compared to the planar C2 h structure, which is analogous for the corresponding [Au(PTN(Me))2](+) complex with Delta H = -0.5 kcal mol(-1). Hence both types of complexes feature free rotation of the PTN ligand about the M-P bond axis. This series of Ag(I) and bis-PTN(Me) Au(I) complexes were evaluated using the agar well diffusion test for potential antimicrobial and antifungal activity. The nature of the counterion was found to have a strong correlation with the area of microbiological growth inhibition. Silver(I) complexes bearing the deprotonated triclosan as the counterion demonstrated the greatest activity, with large zones of growth inhibition, with the tris-ligated triclosan complex obtaining of a high clearance of 42 mm against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli.

Furthermore, as a promising and emerging area for nanomedicine, in situ self-assembly of anticancer drugs and supramolecular antibiotic switches is also discussed about how to regulate drug activity. Selective pericellular assembly can block mass transformation of cancer cells inducing cell apoptosis, and the intracellular assembly can either cause cell death or effectively avoid drug elimination from cytosol of cancer cells because of the assembly-induced retention (AIR) effect.

For planktonic cells, log-linear destruction was obtained, whereas biphasic kinetics were observed for sessile cells. An increased resistance of biofilm cells was observed: the reduction of 6 logarithm units of the population was obtained in 15, 30 and 70 min for planktonic, adherent and biofilm cells, respectively.

Significance and Impact of the Study:The glidarc plasma technology is a promising candidate among the emerging nonthermal techniques for decontamination, as it can destroy even biofilms that are known as particularly resistant to various antimicrobials."

In the literature there is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of diseases. There is, however, insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in relation to the spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. The latest developments in the advanced numerical simulation (CFD) methods offer new possibilities to follow the routes of airborne contaminants.

Methods: For 1994 and 1995 the medical records of all patients with culture-confirmed M. tuberculosis were reviewed according to the 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for case surveillance and risk assessment (infection control parameters). The chi(2)-test was used to compare 1994 and 1995 infection control parameters for statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Results: In 1994 and 1995 there were 253 patients with tuberculosis, 85\% of whom (214/253) had pulmonary-site tuberculosis.

The persistence of abnormal spirometry and symptoms after treatment are well described, but the structural abnormalities underlying these changes remain poorly defined, limiting our ability to phenotype post-TB lung disease in to meaningful categories for clinical management, prognostication, and ongoing research. The relationship between post-TB lung damage and patient-centred outcomes including functional impairment, respiratory symptoms, and health related quality of life also remains unclear. Methods We performed a systematic literature review to determine the prevalence and pattern of imaging-defined lung pathology in adults after medical treatment for pleural, miliary, or pulmonary TB disease. Data were collected on study characteristics, and the modality, timing, and findings of thoracic imaging. The proportion of studies relating imaging findings to spirometry results and patient morbidity was recorded. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottowa score. (Prospero Registration number CRD42015027958) Results We identified 37 eligible studies. The principle features seen on CXR were cavitation (8.383.7\%), bronchiectasis (4.3-11.2\%), and fibrosis (25.0-70.4\%), but prevalence was highly variable. CT imaging identified a wider range of residual abnormalities than CXR, including nodules (25.0-55.8\%), consolidation (3.7-19.2\%), and emphysema (15.0-45.0\%). The prevalence of cavitation was generally lower (7.4-34.6\%) and bronchiectasis higher (35.086.0\%) on CT vs. CXR imaging. A paucity of prospective data, and data from HIV-infected adults and sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) was noted. Few studies related structural damage to physiological impairment, respiratory symptoms, or patient morbidity. Conclusions Post-TB structural lung pathology is common. Prospective data are required to determine the evolution of this lung damage and its associated morbidity over time. Further data are required from HIV-infected groups and those living in sSA."

In 13 patients, respiratory distress occurred; 5 needed mechanical ventilation. Injected throats, conjunctivae and ear drums were common. Other clinical pictures included abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, skin rash, convulsion and bleeding tendency. Abnormal laboratory findings were mild anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, impaired liver function test, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Anemia (11 cases), leukopenia (7 cases) and elevated transaminases levels (7 cases) were more common than previously reported. All patients had para-hilar peribronchial infiltrates in chest roentgenography. Segmental atelectasis and compensated hyper-expansion were found frequently. Pleural effusion were noted in six of our cases. Air leak syndrome occurred in three patients who had received mechanical ventilation. Three of the 15 patients expired: one had a preceding measles infection, all had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. For patients with antibiotic-resistant pneumonia, adenoviral studies should be done. Extrapulmonary manifestations, and some abnormal laboratory findings, i.e., mild anemia, leukopenia, impaired liver function are clues to adenoviral infections, while bleeding tendency can be regarded as a poor prognostic sign for children with adenoviral pneumonia."

Whereas Shigellae are known to be transmitted primarily by direct fecal-oral contact and less commonly by contaminated food and water, the role of the housefly Musca domestica as a mechanical vector of transmission is less appreciated. We sought to assess the contribution of houseflies to Shigella-associated moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children less than five years old in Mirzapur, Bangladesh, a site where shigellosis is hyperendemic, and to model the potential impact of a housefly control intervention. Methods: Stool samples from 843 children presenting to Kumudini Hospital during 2009-2010 with new episodes of MSD (diarrhea accompanied by dehydration, dysentery or hospitalization) were analyzed. Housefly density was measured twice weekly in six randomly selected sentinel households. Poisson time series regression was performed and autoregression-adjusted attributable fractions (AFs) were calculated using the Bruzzi method, with standard errors via jackknife procedure. Findings: Dramatic springtime peaks in housefly density in 2009 and 2010 were followed one to two months later by peaks of Shigella-associated MSD among toddlers and pre-school children. Poisson time series regression showed that housefly density was associated with Shigella cases at three lags (six weeks) (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.39 {[}95\% CI: 1.23 to 1.58] for each log increase in fly count), an association that was not confounded by ambient air temperature. Autocorrelation-adjusted AF calculations showed that a housefly control intervention could have prevented approximately 37\% of the Shigella cases over the study period. Interpretation: Houseflies may play an important role in the seasonal transmission of Shigella in some developing country ecologies. Interventions to control houseflies should be evaluated as possible additions to the public health arsenal to diminish Shigella (and perhaps other causes of) diarrheal infection."

DESIGN: We used Andersen two-stage samplers to collect bioaerosol samples from 24 houses in El Paso, Texas, using tryptic soy agar as the collection media, followed by the replicate plate method on Chapman Stone selective medium to isolate S. aureus. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to determine antibiotic resistance to ampicillin, penicillin, and cefaclor, which represent two distinct classes of antibiotics. RESULTS: The average recovered concentration of respirable heterotrophic organisms found outside each home was 345.38 CFU/m(3), with an average of 12.63 CFU/m(3) for S. aureus. The average recovered concentration of respirable heterotrophic organisms found inside each home was 460.23 CFU/m(3), with an average of 15.39 CFU/m3 for S. aureus. The respirable S. aureus recovered from inside each home had an average resistance of 54.59\% to ampicillin and 60.46\%. to penicillin. Presence of cefaclor-resistant and of multidrug-resistant S. aureus was the same, averaging 13.20\% per house. The respirable S. aureus recovered from outside each home had an average resistance of 34.42\% to ampicillin and 41.81\% to penicillin. Presence of cefaclor-resistant and of multidrug-resistant S. aureus was the same, averaging 13.96\% per house. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that antibiotic-resistant bioaerosols are commonly found within residential homes.

The majority of surgical site infections (SSI) are believed to be caused by airborne transmission of bacteria alighting onto the wound during surgical procedures. We have previously shown that far-ultraviolet C light in the wavelength range of 207-222 nm is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging mammalian cells and tissues. It is important that the lamp be fitted with a filter to remove light emitted at wavelengths longer than 230 nm which are harmful. Aims Using a hairless mouse model of infection of superficial wounds, here we tested the hypothesis that 222-nm light kills MRSA alighting onto a superficial skin incisions as efficiently as typical germicidal light (254 nm), but without inducing skin damage. Methods To simulate the scenario wherein incisions are infected during surgical procedures as pathogens in the room alight on a wound, MRSA was spread on a defined area of the mouse dorsal skin; the infected skin was then exposed to UVC light (222 nm or 254 nm) followed by a superficial incision within the defined area, which was immediately sutured. Two and seven days post procedure, bactericidal efficacy was measured as MRSA colony formation unit (CFU) per gram of harvested skin whereas fixed samples were used to assess skin damage measured in terms of epidermal thickness and DNA photodamage. Results In the circumstance of superficial incisions infected with bacteria alighting onto the wound, 222-nm light showed the same bactericidal properties of 254-nm light but without the associated skin damage. Conclusions Being safe for patient and hospital staff, our results suggested that far-UVC light (222 nm) might be a convenient approach to prevent transmission of drug-resistant infectious agents in the clinical setting."

EFK17 was modified by four d-enantiomer or tryptophan ( W) substitutions at known protease cleavage sites as well as by terminal amidation and acetylation. The peptide variants were studied in terms of proteolytic resistance, antibacterial potency, and cytotoxicity but also in terms their adsorption at model lipid membranes, liposomal leakage generation, and secondary-structure behavior. The W substitutions resulted in a marked reduction in the proteolytic degradation caused by human neutrophil elastase, Staphylococcus aureus aureolysin, and V8 protease but not in the degradation caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase. For the former two endoproteases, amidation and acetylation of the terminals also reduced proteolytic degradation but only when used in combination with W substitutions. The d-enantiomer substitutions rendered the peptides indigestible by all four proteases; however, those peptides displayed little antimicrobial potency. The W- and end-modified peptides, on the other hand, showed an increased bactericidal potency compared to that of the native peptide sequence, coupled with a moderate cytotoxicity that was largely absent in serum. The bactericidal, cytotoxic, and liposome lytic properties correlated with each other as well as with the amount of peptide adsorbed at the lipid membrane and the extent of helix formation associated with the adsorption. The lytic properties of the W- substituted peptides were less impaired by increased ionic strength, presumably by a combination of W- mediated stabilization of the largely amphiphilic helix conformation and a nonelectrostatic W affinity for the bilayer interface. Overall, W substitutions constitute an interesting means to reduce the proteolytic susceptibility of EFK17 while also improving antimicrobial performance."

We infected guinea pigs with the virulent H37Rv strain of MTB for 60days at which point we collected blood. To identify antigenic proteins, membrane protein extracts of MTB H37Ra pellicles and shaken cultures grown for 3, 5, or 7weeks were probed with the infected animals' sera after the proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE). Antigenic proteins were then identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting. Antigenic pellicle proteins were compared across the three timepoints to identify those that were produced consistently during pellicle growth. They were also compared to those membrane proteins identified from harvested shaken cultures to determine pellicle-specific vs. universally expressed proteins. Using this technique, we identified 44 distinct antigenic proteins, nine of which were pellicle-specific. The sequence of antigenic pellicle-specific proteins was checked for sequence conservation across 15 sequenced MTB clinical isolates, three other members of the MTB complex, as well as M.avium and M.smegmatis. The antigenic pellicle-specific protein Rv0097 was found to have very high sequence conservation within the MTB complex but not with related mycobacteria, while FabG4 was highly conserved in all mycobacteria analyzed.

Small airways contribute to the increased resistance to flow by the narrowing of the airway lumen. Morphometric studies have shown that smokers have increased epithelial abnormalities, cellular inflammatory infiltrates in the airway wall, increased muscle and fibrosis, when compared with nonsmokers. Along with these anatomical changes, an increased percentage of airways < 400 microns in diameter is found. In addition to the measured changes, other nonmeasurable, dynamic events occur in the airways of smokers, which further decrease lumen diameter. There is ample evidence to show that the airways of smokers react to nonspecific stimuli by constricting, which results in increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The pathological changes found in smokers, that could be responsible for active muscle constriction and airway narrowing include: 1) airway epithelial damage, resulting in increased permeability and impairment of other epithelial function; 2) chronic airway inflammation; 3) structural changes in the airway wall; and 4) loss of alveolar attachments. However, not all smokers develop the abovementioned airway abnormalities. We describe how smokers could develop either centrilobular emphysema (CLE), or panlobular emphysema (PLE). We have found that smokers with CLE have more abnormal and narrower small airways, and flow limitation is correlated with the small airway abnormalities and not with loss of recoil. In contrast, smokers with PLE have much less severe airway abnormalities, diffuse emphysema that can be detected microscopically at a stage when FEV1 might be only mildly abnormal, and early changes in elastic recoil as evidenced by the changes in the pressure-volume curve of the lung. Furthermore, in PLE, airflow limitation is correlated with loss of recoil but not with abnormalities in the small airways. We believe that the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the two types of emphysema in smokers are different; an airborne mechanism for CLE, possibly related to airway hyperresponsiveness, and a bloodborne mechanism for PLE, which may be related to dysfunction of alpha 1-antiproteases. We conclude that the separation of smokers based on their emphysema type is essential if we are to understand the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in these subjects."

METHODS: During 1995 to 1997, study personnel prospectively recorded information on patients who had TB or were in TB isolation, performed observations of TB isolation rooms, and recorded tuberculin skin-test results of healthcare workers. Genetic typing of M tuberculosis isolates was performed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: We found that only 8.6\% of patients placed in TB isolation proved to have TB; yet, 19\% of patients with pulmonary TB were not isolated on the first day of hospital admission.

We did not find evidence of transmission of TB among healthcare workers (based on tuberculin skin-test results) or patients (based on epidemiological investigation and genetic typing). CONCLUSIONS: We found problems in implementation of some TB infection control measures, but no evidence of healthcare-associated transmission, possibly in part because of limitations in the number of patients and workers studied.

The aim of this cross-sectional prevalence study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of VRE colonization in chronic hemodialysis patients in two hemodialysis centers in Shiraz, Iran. METHODS: Rectal swabs were obtained from all consenting patients and were streaked on the surface of Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA) and incubated at 37 degrees C in air for 24 h. The vancomycin susceptibility of each isolate was confirmed by disk susceptibility testing. The MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin were confirmed by the E test. To identify risk factors, a questionnaire was completed for all the studied patients and the data of VRE positive and negative groups were compared using Man-Withney U test for continues data and the Fisher exact test for categorical data. RESULTS: Of 146 patients investigated, 9 (6.2%) were positive for VRE. All VRE strains were genotypically distinguishable. Risk factors for a VRE-positive culture were ""antimicrobial receipt within 2 months before culture"" (P = 0.003) and ""hospitalization during previous year"" (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: VRE colonization is an under-recognized problem among chronic dialysis patients in Iran. VRE colonization is associated with antibiotic consumption and hospitalization."

Blood and radiologic tests are frequently used for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but it remains unknown which is more useful for its early diagnosis. The aim of the study was to compare usefulness of computed tomographic (CT) scan of chest, latex agglutination (LA) test and determination of plasma (13)--D-glucan (BDG) levels for early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Design and Methods. We treated 215 consecutive patients who underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy. From initiation of Chemotherapy until death or discharge, blood samples were taken weekly and subjected to LA and BDG tests. We performed chest CT scans when patients had any signs of pulmonary infection or an antibiotic-resistant fever. Results. Of the 215 patients, 30 (14.0%) were diagnosed as having IPA. In sixteen cases the diagnosis was definite and in 14 it was suspected. In patientbased analysis, sensitivities of LA and BDG were 44% and 63%, respectively. Sensitivity tended to be lower in patients with IPA localized, to the lung than those with disseminated invasive aspergillosis. Specificities were 93% and 74%, respectively. Either a halo or an air, crescent was obserued in 7 of the 16 patients with IPA, and all of the IPA patients showed some abnormal signs on chest CT scans. On average, CT scan signs preceded a positive LA test by-7.1 days and a positive BDG assay by 11.5 days. In 6 of the 11 patients who became positive for either LA or BDG assay, CT scan signs preceded the positive results by more than seven days. Interpretations and conclusions. Chest CT scan is more beneficial than the blood tests and X-ray for early diagnosis of IPA.(C) 2000, Ferrata Storti Foundation."

The prepared adduct emulsion was incorporated in different easy care finishing formulations to illustrate the impact of that adduct emulsion on the performance, functional and comfort properties of treated cotton/polyester fabric. Among five salts namely ammonium sulphate, magnesium chloride, zinc sulphate, copper sulphate and ammonium chloride examined as catalysts for the aforementioned finishing formulations, ammonium sulphate with a concentration of 6 g/l was the unique catalyst that imparts treated fabric with significant durable functional properties. Furthermore, increasing of the adduct concentration in the finishing bath results in an increase in fabric weight, tensile strength, softness, stiffness, water repellency, antibacterial, water vapor resistance and thermal resistance properties of treated fabric along with a reduction in resiliency and air permeability properties of that fabric. On the other hand, inclusion Ag or TiO2 nano-particles (NPs) in easy care finishing baths containing the SA/TDI/PEG1000 adduct emulsion effectively upgrades the antibacterial properties along with a slight reduction in the water repellency of treated fabric.

The combination of chemotherapy with surgical treatment has been producing higher acid-fast bacilli (AFB) negative sputum conversion and longer survival rates. This treatment strategy may be the solution for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of the medical records and laboratory findings of 49 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among 130 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for pulmonary tuberculosis between January 1995 and December 1999 at National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital, Korea. RESULTS: The mean number of drugs to which the patients were resistant was 4.5. Patients had a mean age of 35 years. Cavitary lesions on plain chest X-ray were shown in 43/49 patients (87.8\%); 31 had positive sputum cultures preoperatively (63.3\%). The surgical techniques used were as follows: 12 pneumonectomies, 28 lobectomies, seven lobectomies with segmentectomies or wedge resections, one wedge resection and one cavernoplasty. The AFB negative sputum conversion rate was 93.5\% with continuous postoperative chemotherapy. There were no deaths after surgery. Postoperative complications that developed were six cases of air leakage over a week, one of postoperative bleeding and one of wound infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of pulmonary resection with postoperative chemotherapy in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Although there are different ideas about indications for surgery and the length and content of postoperative drug regimens, pulmonary resection should be considered an effective measure in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis."

Analysis of AS-48 digestion fragments in bulk by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, and MALDI-TOF proves that the previous pepsin exposition promotes digestion by trypsin/chymotrypsin by exposing new cleavage sites. Regarding adsorbed AS-48, the in vitro digestion profile shows that the conformational change undergone by AS-48 upon adsorption affects its digestibility. Gastrointestinal enzymes cleave only susceptible residues, which are oriented into the aqueous phase, while hydrophobic susceptible residues remain undigested. Evaluation of the elasticity of the adsorbed layer confirms also the presence of undigested AS-48. These results are important towards the use of AS-48 in food formulations; assuring that some intact AS-48 resists digestion guarantees its antibacterial activity throughout the gastrointestinal tract."

The MIC of Rifampicin to tubercle bacilli isolated from 1, 779 Rifampicin untreated patients who were admitted to our hospital from June 1970 to June 1975 was studied by using 1% Ogawa medium. 2. There were 4 cases resistant to 50mcg of Rifampicin, but 3 of them had enough reason to be considered as they had been treated already by the drug, and the technical failure was suspected in the remaining one case. 3. By indirect method, there were 7 patients (0.7%), whose bacilli grew 1% to 10% on 10 mcg of Rifampicin medium among 1, 065 patients and no bacilli grew over 11% on that medium. However, by direct method, there were 115 cases (16.1%) whose bacilli grew 1% to 10% on 10 mcg medium among 714 cases and 6 cases (0.8%) over 11%. By the direct method, bacilli grew more easily than by the indirect method on the medium containing the critical drug concentration; in other words, the drug resistance was expressed higher by the direct method (Table 2). The growth of bacilli seems to be more active on the direct method. 4. The bacilli from the patients admitted after July 1974, showed apparently higher rate of resistance than those admitted before (Table 3~4). This can be explained by the change in the stopper from cork type to M type. The latter stopper was invented by Futamura of our laboratory, which is usually air tight but allows the air leak into a tube any time when neccessary. Moreover it prevents the drying up of the medium often seen when the air enters too much. Thus, the improvement of the growing condition of bacilli was achieved. 5. MIC of Rifampicin was 10% for the indirect method and 50% for the direct method with a few exception both on the 10 mcg Rifampicin medium. However, for the clinical significance of Rifampicin resistance, the criteria seem to be more reasonable if we take 50% growth or more on the 10 mcg Rifampicin medium, and we may add 1% growth or more on the 50mcg Rifampicin medium which will be discussed in the 2nd report.  1976, JAPANESE SOCIETY FOR TUBERCULOSIS.

The large use of antibiotics in the medical settings and animal husbandry places has resulted in higher abundances of ARB and ARGs in the relevant and surrounding atmosphere than in urban and general indoor air environments. ARGs can be spread by adhering to airborne particles, and researchers have also found that air media contain more abundant ARGs than other environmental media such as soil, water and sediment.

Bioinformatic analysis showed the effect of dust events on the diversity of the atmospheric microbiome. The relative abundance of desert soil-associated bacteria increased during dust events, while the relative abundance of anthropogenic-influenced taxa decreased. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of selected clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) showed that their relative abundance decreased during dust events. The ARG profiles on dust-free days were similar to those in aerosol collected in a poultry house, suggesting a strong agricultural influence on the local ambient profiles. We conclude that dust storms enrich the ambient airborne microbiome with new soil-derived bacteria that disappear as the dust settles, suggesting that the bacteria are transported attached to the dust particles. Dust storms do not seem to be an important vector for transport of probed ARGs."

Soil samples collected from suburbs of Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province were introduced to represent three types of land use change from paddy rice to asparagus production, vineyards and field mustard cultivation, and divided into two portions, one of which was air-dried and sieved through 2-, 0.3- and 0.149-mm nylon mesh for determination of pH and heavy metals. The other portion was frozen at -20 A degrees C, freeze-dried and sieved through a 0.3-mm nylon mesh for tetracyline determination. HM and TC concentrations in surface soils of 14-year-old mustard fields were the highest with total Cu, Zn, Cd and aTCs of 50.5, 196, 1.03 mg kg(-1) and 22.9 mu g kg(-1), respectively, on average. The total Cu sequence was field mustard > vineyards > asparagus when duration of land use change was considered; oxytetracycline (OTC) and doxycycline were dominant in soils used for asparagus production; OTC was dominant in vineyards and chlortetracycline (CTC) was dominant in mustard soils. There were positive pollution relationships among Cu, Zn and aTCs, especially between Cu and Zn or Cu and aTCs. Repeated and excessive application of manures from intensive farming systems may produce combined contamination with HMs and TCs which were found in the top 20 cm of the arable soil profiles and also extended to 20-40 cm depth. Increasing manure application rate and cultivation time led to continuing increases in residue concentrations and movement down the soil profile."

In a controlled study that compared the outcome of three different interventions (training to regulate slow cortical potentials, N = 34; training to regulate breath rate and the amount of carbon dioxide in the end tidal volume of the exhaled air, N = 11; modification of drug regime, N = 25), pre- and postmeasurements of a short version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale were applied. The interval between the two assessments was more than 12 months, with a mean of 61 weeks. Mean age of the patients was 35, with a range from 17 to 57. The highly significant 7-point increment of IQ only after training of slow cortical potentials was not related to clinical (e.g., seizure reduction) or neuropsychological (e.g., attention and memory) variables. Instead, it was related to psychophysiological measures: IQ change was inversely related to the Latency of the P300 component of event-related brain potentials and directly related to the Latency of the P2 component and the increase of N2 Amplitude during training. We conclude that regulation training of slow cortical potentials improves IQ in patients with refractory partial epilepsy, which might be related to an improved ability for controlled allocation of cognitive resources.

In the present study, the function of aptamers against MTB in a mouse model was further determined. It was demonstrated that the NK2 aptamer has marked inhibitory effects on the adhesion/invasion of H37Rv to macrophages in vitro and stimulates intracellular IFN-gamma production in CD4(+) T-cells. The aptamer pool exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on H37Rv adhesion/invasion to CD8(+) T-cells in vitro compared with all aptamers-treated and control groups.

Results of the present study indicate that the 10th pool aptamers and NK2 may play an active role against H37Rv, however, the effect was different in vivo and in vitro. The treatment effect of 10th pool aptamers was found to be better in comparison to NK2 in vivo. Additional target sites involved in pathogenicity of H37Rv were also revealed and the NK2 binding site and aptamers, including the 10th pool aptamers, may antagonize these sites.

Environments where selection and transmission of antibiotic resistance frequently take place are likely to be characterized by high abundance and diversity of horizontally transferable ARGs. Large-scale quantitative data on ARGs is, however, lacking for most types of environments, including humans and animals, as is data on resistance genes to potential co-selective agents, such as biocides and metals. This paucity prevents efficient identification of risk environments. Results: We provide a comprehensive characterization of resistance genes, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial taxonomic compositions for 864 metagenomes from humans (n = 350), animals (n = 145) and external environments (n = 369), all deeply sequenced using Illumina technology. Environment types showed clear differences in both resistance profiles and bacterial community compositions. Human and animal microbial communities were characterized by limited taxonomic diversity and low abundance and diversity of biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs but a relatively high abundance of ARGs. In contrast, external environments showed consistently high taxonomic diversity which in turn was linked to high diversity of both biocide/metal resistance genes and MGEs. Water, sediment and soil generally carried low relative abundance and few varieties of known ARGs, whereas wastewater/sludge was on par with the human gut. The environments with the largest relative abundance and/or diversity of ARGs, including genes encoding resistance to last resort antibiotics, were those subjected to industrial antibiotic pollution and a limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event. Conclusions: Our study identifies air and antibiotic-polluted environments as under-investigated transmission routes and reservoirs for antibiotic resistance. The high taxonomic and genetic diversity of external environments supports the hypothesis that these also form vast sources of unknown resistance genes, with potential to be transferred to pathogens in the future."

To investigate whether aromatic volatiles in highbush blueberry fruit are associated with postharvest fruit rot resistance, we compared volatiles emitted from whole fruit and extracts from fruit kept in air at 20 degrees C for 0 to 6 days postharvest from cultivars having a wide range of resistance to anthracnose. Antimicrobial volatiles detected included the aldehydes, trans-2-hexenal and hexanal; the monoterpenes, limonene, linalool, 8-hydroxylinalool, alpha-terpineol, and terpinyl acetate; and the sesquiterpenes, cadinene, caryophyllene, and alpha-farnesene. There were significant correlations between some detected volatiles and these differed in whole fruit and extracts. Hexanal (in fruit extracts), trans-2-hexenal, terpinyl acetate, and cadinene emissions increased in most cultivars when fruit were kept in air at 20 degrees C for various times postharvest. Volatile emissions from whole fruit and extracts varied widely among the cultivars with early ripening cultivars generally showing higher volatile emissions than later ripening cultivars. Although the cultivars tested differed in quantities, and in some cases, the types of volatiles produced, these differences were not related to pedigree (i.e., species composition) nor to known anthracnose resistance ratings. Except for the confounded emissions of terpinyl acetate and cadinene, more than 80\% of the variation observed for each volatile was attributable to the cultivar (genetic), year (environmental), and cultivar-by-year interaction. The results suggest that, although antimicrobial aldehydes and terpenes emitted from fully ripe highbush blueberry fruit and extracts might be important flavor and aroma components, they do not significantly contribute to disease resistance against anthracnose fruit rot."

Most of the attention in the literature has been centred on animal-based compost because of concerns related to its potential to serve as a source of microorganisms pathogenic to humans. It will be the focus of this presentation. It is now widely-accepted that non-composted animal waste can have a negative effect on the microbial quality of vegetables and fruits, especially those subject to little or no processing prior to their ingestion. Although a major goal of proper composting is the elimination of pathogenic microbes all that may be achieved is a reduction, usually of 3-4 logs. Thus, even if composted material is applied, there is still a crop contamination risk. This is dependant on several factors, including the amount of crop contact with the soil, physical condition of the crop, soil type and moisture content. For example, root and tuber crops are generally the most exposed to incorporated compost, followed by low-growing leafy vegetables and similar crops. Injured leafy vegetables are more susceptible to compost-borne, human bacterial pathogens than are non-injured plants. Another less appreciated scientific observation is that, given the appropriate conditions, i.e., post-processing storage at 22 or 35 degrees C, or slow compost cooling, significant re-growth of low concentration pathogens, e. g., Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes, can occur in properly-composted material. Furthermore, there are reports that properly-composted materials can serve as a milieu for the proliferation of bacterial pathogens introduced after the composting was completed. During horticultural production, re-introduction could occur via the application of contaminated irrigation water, the deposition of bird or animal fecal material, or as a result of the settling of air-borne materials. One special concern is the possibility of antibiotic resistance occurring in the microbial population of compost derived from the waste of animals exposed to antibiotics."

The samples were collected from 20 different pigeon-feeding places in the city. These samples were processed for the isolation and identification of fungi by using standard conventional methods. The fungal strains isolated were also tested for their susceptibility to commonly used antifungal agents by disc diffusion technique. Results: There were 105 samples. A wide variety of fungal strains belonging to different genera of Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Candida were isolated and identified by using conventional methods. The antifungal resistance pattern of these strains also depicts emergence of resistance against commonly used antifungal agents such as amphotericin B and fluconazole. Conclusion: The soil and air of places densely populated with pigeons were found to be loaded with fungal spores and many of them were potential pathogens."

Samples were collected from clinically healthy birds (oral cavity) and from birds with aspergillosis (lungs and air sacs). The study was carried out using the disk diffusion method according to the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) M44-A2 procedure in parallel with the microdilution broth method according to CLSI M38-A2. The disk diffusion method showed that the all of the strains, irrespective of source, were resistant to miconazole. Resistance to the remaining azoles and amphotericin B ranged from 90.6 to 70.6%. Complete susceptibility was noted for voriconazole and enilconazole. Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) confirmed the high resistance of the strains tested to clotrimazole (MIC90 = 16 gmL -1), amphotericin B (MIC90 = 16 gmL -1), varied susceptibility to itraconazole (MIC 0.5-8 gmL-1), and 100% susceptibility to enilconazole and voriconazole. A correlation was noted between the susceptibility of the strains and their source. The highest percentage of resistant strains was noted in isolates from the lungs (100% for amphotericin B and clotrimazole and 35.7% for itraconazole).

The regular detectability of MRSA in the air of pigsties as well as in exhaust air of pig farms (mean count: 10(2) cfu/m(3)) poses the question whether an airborne spread and, therefore, a MRSA colonization of animals via the airborne route exists. To answer this question, we exposed three groups of nine MRSA-negative tested piglets each to a defined airborne MRSA concentration (10(2), 10(4), and 10(6) cfu/m(3)) in our aerosol chamber for 24 h. In the following observation period of 21 days, the MRSA status of the piglets was monitored by taking different swab samples (nasal, pharyngeal, skin, conjunctival, and rectal swab). At the end of the experiment, we euthanized the piglets and investigated different tissues and organs for the spread of MRSA. The data of our study imply the presence of an airborne MRSA colonization route: the animals exposed to 10(6) cfu/m(3) MRSA in the air were persistent colonized. The piglets exposed to an airborne MRSA concentration of 10(4) cfu/m(3) were transient, and the piglets exposed to an airborne MRSA concentration of 10(2) cfu/m(3) were not colonized.

Many Salmonella have the ability to form biofilms. These natural structures, elaborated by bacteria are important in food production because their formation contributes to bacterial survival. Adherent bacterial cells are more resilient to displacement strategies including physical and chemical procedures as a consequence of their altered more resistant phenotype. By improving our understanding of the nature of biofilms, this data could positively contribute to the development and implementation of eradication strategies. In this study, Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and DT104b were investigated for their ability to forth biofilms on a range of different surfaces under defined environmental growth conditions. Phenotypic characterisation involved examining colony morphology on indicator agars, assessing their ability to survive chlorine-based challenges and investigating their ability to attach to stainless steel and to plastic surfaces. All bacterial isolates were investigated for the presence of Salmonella genomic island I (SGI1) which is thought to enhance efficient biofilm formation. It was found that the majority of strains possess biofilm forming capabilities but successful attachment is highly dependent on the surface on which the biofilm is forming. The strains readily attached to stainless steel and plastic surfaces and survived high chlorine concentrations. Molecular and phenotypic comparisons of strong and weak biofilm forming strains indicate that biofilm development is not solely dependent on the acquirement of SGI1. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The international literature has indicated the scarcity of studies on the treatment of ABECB compared to an abundance of information regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), of which ABECB is often considered the initial ore predisposing stage, even though a precise evolutionary correlation between these pathologies has not yet been demonstrated. ABECB is the principle cause of doctor visits, hospitalization and death in COPD patients. The natural course of the disease is characterized by the appearance of exacerbation episodes (a mean of two yearly). For this reason it is indispensable to prevent exacerbations, to treat them as quickly as possible, in order to minimize their negative effects on the respiratory tract and the patient's general health. The routine use of antibiotic therapy is controversial because at least 20\% of exacerbations do not have an infectious origin and about 30\% are viral. In most cases the choice of antibiotic is empiric, in both ABECB patients without risk factors (mild form) and in those with risk factors such as cigarette smoking or constant exposure to air pollutants (moderate form). For these reasons it is necessary to keep up to date on the local and regional bacteria etiological situation and to be aware of antibiotic resistance patterns for the most commonly involved pathogens. An analysis of the most recent information in Italy has confirmed the involvement of the terrible three bacterial species Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the cause of 85-95\% of ABECB cases, as well as an increase in resistance to various classes of molecules by all the respiratory pathogens. On the basis of the known resistance patterns in Italy, some antibiotics are no longer considered first choice for empiric therapy such as the unprotected beta-lactams, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and the macrolides) which should be used only after antibiotic susceptibility testing indicates they are still active against the pathogens. The epidemiological picture of bacterial resistance in Italy has greatly restricted the choice of antibiotics which can be used for this type of infection, justifying interest in the oral beta-lactams which have the highest therapeutic index and are first choice therapy against bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Included in this group are amoxicillin-clavulanate and the new cephem molecule, cefditoren, which has been available in Italy since 2008. Thanks to its good pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as clinical performance, cefditoren may be considered a drug of choice against exacerbations of chronic bronchitis."

As a result, retail pork products, as well as surface and groundwaters contaminated with swine waste, have been shown to be sources of human exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, it is unclear whether the air within swine operations also serves as a source of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. To investigate this issue, we sampled the air within a concentrated swine feeding operation with an all-glass impinger. Samples were analyzed using a method for the isolation of Enterococcus. A total of 137 presumptive Enterococcus isolates were identified to species level using standard biochemical tests and analyzed for resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin using the agar dilution method. Thirty-four percent of the isolates were confirmed as Enterococcus, 32\% were identified as coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 33\% were identified as viridans group streptococci. Regardless of bacterial species, 98\% of the isolates expressed high-level resistance to at least two antibiotics commonly used in swine production. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic that has never been approved for use in livestock in the United States. In conclusion, high-level multidrug-resistant Enterococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and viridans group streptococci were detected in the air of a concentrated swine feeding operation. These findings suggest that the inhalation of air from these facilities may serve as an exposure pathway for the transfer of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens from swine to humans."

Nasal colonization of pigs with MRSA (113/547 (20.7\%)) was less frequent than rectal colonization with ESBL-E (163/540 (30.2\%)). On the individual farm level MRSA correlated with ESBL-E recovery. The data further provide information on prevalence at different stages of pig production, including abattoirs, as well as in air samples and humans living and working on the farms. Notably, MRSA was detected in stable air samples of 34 out of 35 pig farms, highlighting air as an important MRSA transmission reservoir. The majority of MRSA isolates, including those from humans, displayed tetracycline resistance and spa types t011 and t034 characteristic for LA-MRSA, demonstrating transmission from pigs to humans. ESBL-E positive air samples were detected on 6 out of 35 farms but no pig-to-human transmission was found. Detection of ESBL-E, e.g. mostly Escherichia coli with CTX-M-type ESBL, was limited to these six farms. Molecular typing revealed transmission of ESBL-E within the pig compartments; however, related strains were also found on unrelated farms. Although our data suggest that acquisition of MRSA and ESBL-E might occur among pigs in the abattoirs, MRSA and ESBL-E were not detected on the carcasses. Altogether, our data define stable air (MRSA), pig compartments (ESBL-E) and abattoir waiting areas (MRSA and ESBL-E) as major hot spots for transmission of MRSA and/or ESBL-E along the pig production chain."

Prevention strategies include efforts to insert implants under stringent aseptic conditions, and also encompass the development of novel materials which interfere with the initial attachment of microorganisms to the surface of the device. Microbial cells also attach onto hygienic surfaces in the hospital setting, and thereby pose a crossinfection problem. In this case, vigorous cleaning and sanitizing regimes may be employed in addition to any surface modifications. Many factors affect the initial attachment of organisms to inert substrata, and their subsequent retention or removal/detachment, including the physical and chemical nature and location of the substratum, the type of organic material and microorganisms potentially fouling the surface, and the nature of the interface (solid-liquid in the body; solid-air on environmental surfaces). Focusing on one factor, surface topography, it is apparent that many further variables need to be defined in order to fully understand the interactions occurring between the cell and surface. It is therefore important when modifying one substratum surface property in order to reduce adhesion, to also consider other potentially confounding factors."

The production of beta lactamase enzymes remains as one of the major factors contributing to the development of resistance to beta lactams. These enzymes hydrolyze the beta lactam ring of the antibiotic and render it ineffective. Extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing bacteria have the ability to develop resistance to a number of antibiotics including the carbapenem and other third generation cephalosporins. In addition, the recent emergence and dissemination of the colistin resistance determinants mcr-1, mcr-2 and mcr-3 poses a serious threat to colistin as a drug of last resort in human medicine. In this review, we utilized words such as ""colistin resistance and Escherichia coli"", ""Klebsiella and colistin resistance"", ""colistin resistance and Salmonella"" as well as ""detection of mcr-1 genes in Salmonella and E. coli"". The extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing bacteria under Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to colistin possess the ability to be transferred resistant determinants to other susceptible cells at a higher frequency. In this paper, the role of manure from food animals and how air travel contributes to the dissemination of mcr-1 haboring bacteria, resistance determinants and other metabolites that constitute a public health problem was also reviewed.

Prolonged selection in spatially structured microcosms caused the cost of specialization to decline without loss of the benefits associated with specialization.

Objectives: To determine the 16S rRNA bacterial biodiversity of flood water that affected parts of Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia from December 2014 to January 2015. Methods: We collected 31 water samples in 50 mL sterile containers from 6 different locations. Bacteria were cultured by inoculating into blood and nutrient agar using sterile swabs. Various bacteria were identified from the cultures that grew within 24-48 h, using colony morphology, differential/selective media, and biochemical tests. The isolated bacteria were identified using DNA Sanger sequencing and comparing with sequences at NCBI BLAST and SepsiTest BLAST up to species level, and sequences were deposited at GenBank. A 16S rRNA biodiversity chart was obtained. Sequences with low trace score (<20) were removed, sequences were trimmed, capped (pair-wise assembled) and the 16S biodiversity was analyzed using a 16S biodiversity tool (Geneious version R8.1). Results: The 16S biodiversity tool results revealed 22 genera of bacteria belonging to 12 families: Moraxellaceae (10\%), Aeromonadaceae (8\%), Comamonadaceae (13\%), Neisseriaceae (2\%), Bacillaceae 1 (16\%), Staphylococcaceae (8\%), Bacillales Incertae Sedis XII (3\%), Bacillaceae 2 (3\%), Streptococcaceae (2\%), Flavobacteriaceae (2\%), Enterobacteriaceae (25\%), and Pseudomonadaceae (10\%).

Moreover, the mechanisms via which tumours resist anti-angiogenic therapies are poorly understood. Importantly, rather than utilizing angiogenesis, some metastases may instead incorporate pre-existing vessels from surrounding tissue (vessel co-option). As anti-angiogenic therapies were designed to target only new blood vessel growth, vessel co-option has been proposed as a mechanism that could drive resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. However, vessel co-option has not been extensively studied in lung metastases, and its potential to mediate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in lung metastases is not established. Here, we examined the mechanism of tumour vascularization in 164 human lung metastasis specimens (composed of breast, colorectal and renal cancer lung metastasis cases). We identified four distinct histopathological growth patterns (HGPs) of lung metastasis (alveolar, interstitial, perivascular cuffing, and pushing), each of which vascularized via a different mechanism. In the alveolar HGP, cancer cells invaded the alveolar air spaces, facilitating the co-option of alveolar capillaries. In the interstitial HGP, cancer cells invaded the alveolar walls to co-opt alveolar capillaries. In the perivascular cuffing HGP, cancer cells grew by co-opting larger vessels of the lung. Only in the pushing HGP did the tumours vascularize by angiogenesis. Importantly, vessel co-option occurred with high frequency, being present in >80\% of the cases examined. Moreover, we provide evidence that vessel co-option mediates resistance to the anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in preclinical lung metastasis models. Assuming that our interpretation of the data is correct, we conclude that vessel co-option in lung metastases occurs through at least three distinct mechanisms, that vessel co-option occurs frequently in lung metastases, and that vessel co-option could mediate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in lung metastases. Novel therapies designed to target both angiogenesis and vessel co-option are therefore warranted. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Ciprofloxacin drop that is of fluoroquinolone drug class due to good treatment effect is now widely used in the treatment of chronic media otitis. Due to the widespread use, it seems proper research on the human population has not been taken to ensure its non-toxicity in the inner ear, therefore comparison of local ciprofloxacin ototoxicity with systemic in chronic media otitis is investigated in this study. MATERIALS & METHODS: This study was conducted as a randomized clinical trial. Prospective methods were considered and the number of samples in the study group was 40 patients that were treated with ciprofloxacin drops. And in the control group 32 patients with chronic media otitis who were treated with ciprofloxacin tablets. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Statistical indicators of different frequencies in air conduction (AC) in both groups showed, there was significant improvement in hearing thresholds at frequencies of 250, 8000, 1000 in air conduction for the group receiving drops compared to the group receiving tablet. Based on statistical indicators in different frequencies of bone conduction in the two treated groups, there was significant difference in the two groups receiving tablets and drops only at a frequency of 4000 Hz that drop impact improves hearing threshold and in contrast in the group receiving tablet hearing loss was seen in the frequency of 4000. DISCUSSION: Topical ciprofloxacin is a safe and uncomplicated ototoxic drug that is an effective antibiotic used in the treatment of refractory chronic otitis those dregs such as pseudomonas aerogenusa and staphylococci resistant to methicillin are responsible for it, which in the usual doses has not harmful effects on hearing hairy cells."

PCM is of major importance, especially in Latin America, and its treatment relies on the use of antifungal drugs. However, the course of treatment is lengthy, leading to side effects and even development of fungal resistance. The goal of the study was to use low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to stimulate PMN to fight Pb in vivo. Swiss mice with subcutaneous air pouches were inoculated with a virulent strain of Pb or fungal cell wall components (Zymosan), and then received LLLT (780 nm; 50 mW; 12.5 J/cm2; 30 seconds per point, giving a total energy of 0.5 J per point) on alternate days at two points on each hind leg. The aim was to reach the bone marrow in the femur with light. Non-irradiated animals were used as controls. The number and viability of the PMN that migrated to the inoculation site was assessed, as well as their ability to synthesize proteins, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their fungicidal activity. The highly pure PMN populations obtained after 10 days of infection were also subsequently cultured in the presence of Pb for trials of protein production, evaluation of mitochondrial activity, ROS production and quantification of viable fungi growth. PMN from mice that received LLLT were more active metabolically, had higher fungicidal activity against Pb in vivo and also in vitro. The kinetics of neutrophil protein production also correlated with a more activated state. LLLT may be a safe and non-invasive approach to deal with PCM infection."

METHODS: This was a prospective epidemiologic study on patients who were hospitalized in a foreign country and repatriated to a hospital in their home country by international aeromedical transport on scheduled airlines or ambulance jets. The study was carried out by the Department of Pediatrics, Department of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, and MedCall Germany, the organizing company for repatriation. One hundred and three patients, who were hospitalized abroad, required repatriation by international interhospital air transport and met the entry criteria. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty-three swabs from brow, nose, ear, throat, groin or axilla were taken from 103 patients, mean age 62 years. They were transported from southern and eastern European countries, Morocco, Egypt, Ghana, Tunisia, Pakistan, the United States and the Bahamas to destinations in Germany, the UK, Belgium, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Forty-four patients were in an intensive care unit (ICU) for 6.5 days (median) prior to transport. Forty patients received antibiotics at the time of repatriation. Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida were found. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found in three patients (3%), ventilated for 17 days, and treated in the ICU for a median of 23 days. In 2 patients, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were found. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization of patients undergoing international interhospital air transport does not differ from that of patients in a European hospital. Multiresistant bacteria, especially MRSA, were found only in ICU patients. There is no elevated risk of transmission of multiresistant bacteria in this patient group compared to other patients treated in hospital, especially in ICUs."

Detection of airborne bacteria was carried out using culture plates with and without beta-lactams. BLRB isolates were screened for the presence of 5 common beta-lactamase-encoding genes. Sequence analysis of predominant BLRB was also performed. Results: The prevalence of BLRB ranged between 3\% and 34\%. Oxacillin-resistant bacteria had the highest prevalence, followed by ceftazidime-and cefazolin-resistant bacteria. The frequency of beta-lactamaseencoding genes in isolated BLRB ranged between 0\% and 47\%, with the highest and lowest detection for OXA-23 and CTX-m-32, respectively. MecA had a relatively high frequency in surgery wards and operating theaters, whereas the frequency of blaTEM was higher in intensive care units and internal medicine wards. OXA-51 was detected in 4 wards. Acinetobacter spp, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus spp were the most predominant BLRB. Conclusions: The results revealed that hospital air is a potential route of transmission of BLRB, such as Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus, 2 important causative agents of nosocomial infections. Therefore, improvement of control measures against the spreading of airborne bacteria in hospital environments is warranted.

In Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes fatal fungal meningoencephalitis, the Can2 CA plays essential roles during both cellular growth in air and sexual differentiation of the pathogen. However the signaling networks downstream of Can2 are largely unknown. To address this question, the present study employed comparative transcriptome DNA microarray analysis of a C. neoformans strain in which CAN2 expression is artificially controlled by the CTR4 (copper transporter) promoter. The P-CTR4::CAN2 strain showed growth defects in a CO2-dependent manner when CAN2 was repressed but resumed normal growth when CAN2 was overexpressed. The Can2-dependent genes identified by the transcriptome analysis include FAS1 (fatty acid synthase 1) and GPB1 (G-protein beta subunit), supporting the roles of Can2 in fatty acid biosynthesis and sexual differentiation. Cas3, a capsular structure designer protein, was also discovered to be Can2-dependent and yet was not involved in CO2-mediated capsule induction. Most notably, a majority of Can2-dependent genes were environmental stress-regulated (ESR) genes. Supporting this, the CAN2 overexpression strain was hypersensitive to oxidative and genotoxic stress as well as antifungal drugs, such as polyene and azole drugs, potentially due to defective membrane integrity. Finally, an oxidative stress-responsive Atf1 transcription factor was also found to be Can2-dependent. Atf1 not only plays an important role in diverse stress responses, including thermotolerance and antifungal drug resistance, but also represses melanin and capsule production in C. neoformans. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the comprehensive signaling networks orchestrated by CA/CO2-sensing pathways in pathogenic fungi."

Dynamic concentrations of 22 subtypes of ARGs, class 1 integron (intl1), and 2 potential human pathogenic bacteria (HPB), and bacterial communities were investigated using droplet digital PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. In this study, intl1 and 22 subtypes of ARGs (except tetQ) were detected in air of composting, packaging, office, and downwind areas. The highest concentration of 15 out of 22 subtypes of ARGs was detected in the packaging areas, and intl1 also had the maximum average concentration of 104 copies/m3, with up to (1.78 +/- 0.49) x10(-2) copies/16S rRNA copy. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling of ARGs, potential HPBs, and bacterial components all indicated that the bioaerosol pollutant pattern in packaging areas was most similar to that in composting areas, followed by office, downwind, and upwind areas. The co-occurrence between ARGs and bacterial taxa assessed by Procrustes test, mantel test, and network analysis implied that aerosolized ARG fragments from composting and packaging areas contributed to the compositions of ARG aerosols in office and downwind areas.

The threat that these acid adapted cells pose to food safety could be enhanced if they also produce biofilms in acidic conditions. The cells were add-adapted by culturing them in 1\% glucose and their ability to form biofilms on stainless steel and on the surface of Luria Bertani (LB) broth at pH 7 and pH 5 was examined. Plate counts were performed to examine cell survival. RNA was isolated from cells to examine changes in the expression of genes associated with virulence, invasion, biofilm formation and global gene regulation in response to acid stress. Of the 4 isolates that were examined only one (1481) that produced a rigid biofilm in LB broth at pH 7 also formed this same structure at pH 5. This indicated that the lactic acid severely impeded the biofilm producing capabilities of the other isolates examined under these conditions. Isolate 1481 also had higher expression of genes associated with virulence (hilA) and invasion (invA) with a 24.34-fold and 13.68-fold increase in relative gene expression respectively at pH 5 compared to pH 7. Although genes associated with biofilm formation had increased expression in response to acid stress for all the isolates this only resulted in the formation of a biofilm by isolate 1481. This suggests that in addition to the range of genes associated with biofilm production at neutral pH, there are genes whose protein products specifically aid in biofilm production in acidic environments. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for the use of lactic acid for the inhibition of Salmonella biofilms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

At station P, where airborne bacterial composition was evaluated as a mean value of 20 repeated experiments, there were 42% Gram-positive cocci, 37% Gram-positive rods, 3.5% Bacillus strains and 5.5% Gram-negative rods. Fluctuating values of cell amounts for Gram-positive cocci and rods during these experiments suggested that in the atmospheric layer near the ground, the former was a more transient group of airborne bacteria than the latter. When airborne bacterial flora over the experimental area was surveyed by observations at six stations, the dispersion profile of bacterial flora closely corresponded to vegetating states on the surface of the ground. Over vegetating areas, airborne bacterial flora appeared in about equal amounts of Gram-positive rods and cocci, while over bare ground, Gram-positive rods appeared more abundantly than Gram-positive cocci.

Under proper land application conditions, the nutrients and organisms in poultry wastes pose little environmental threat. Environmental contamination occurs when land application of poultry wastes is in excess of crop utilization potential, or is done under poor management conditions causing nutrient loss from environmental factors such as soil erosion or surface runoff during rainfall. Environmental parameters of concern are N, P, and certain metals (Cu and Zn in particular), as well as pathogenic microorganisms that may be contained in poultry waste. The biochemical cycle of N is very dynamic, and N contained in poultry waste may either be removed by crop harvest, leave the animal production facility, waste treatment lagoon, or application field as a gas (NH3, NO, NO 2, N2O, or N2), or, due to its mobility in soil, be transported in organic or inorganic N forms in the liquid state via surface runoff or leaching into groundwater. Elevated concentrations of NO 3-N in groundwater used for human consumption is a health risk to infants that are susceptible to methemoglobinemia. An environmental impact resulting from elevated NO3-N is eutrophication of surface waters. Ammonia loss from poultry waste is an environmental concern because of volatilized wet and dry deposits of NH3 into nitrogen-sensitive ecosystems. Phosphorus in poultry wastes may contribute to environmental degradation by accelerating the process of eutrophication. Unlike N, P is very immobile in soil and must first be transported to a surface water environment to have an environmental impact. It is generally accepted, however, that this nutrient affects receiving waters via transport in eroding soil as sediment-bound P or in surface runoff as soluble inorganic or organic P. Numerous studies have reported that excess P contained in land-applied manures may contribute to eutrophication. Soils containing P concentrations that greatly exceed the agronomic potential of crops may require years or even decades to return to levels that are crop limiting for this nutrient. Environmental concerns include the capacity of such soils to adsorb new P and the amount of P loss from these soils from erosion, runoff, drainage, or leaching to groundwater. Although much information is available regarding the loss of P from agricultural fields from erosion and runoff, less information is available regarding P losses from fields receiving poultry wastes. However, studies have shown that there are many challenges to controlling P losses from fields receiving manures. In addition, subsurface transport of P resulting from repeated application of poultry manure onto soils that are artificially drained is an environmental concern where drainage waters enter or interact with water bodies sensitive to eutrophication. Trace elements such as As, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn are often added in excess to poultry feed to increase the animal's rate of weight gain, feed efficiency, and egg production and to prevent diseases. Because most of the excess trace elements are not absorbed by the bird, the concentration of elements excreted in the manure will reflect dietary overformulation. Because trace elements are generally required in very small quantities for crop growth and, like P, are immobile in most soil types, their concentrations will increase with repeated land application of poultry wastes. Of particular concern are accumulations of Cu and Zn in certain soil types utilized for certain crops. Copper and Zn toxicity for some crops have been documented in some areas receiving repeated land-applied poultry wastes. A potential environmental concern relative to poultry litter and trace elements in receiving soils involves the transport of harmful metals into groundwater. Soluble organic ligands contained in land-applied poultry litter may impact the mobility of potentially harmful trace elements in soils because the dissolved organic matter in poultry litter is available to form mobile complexes with certain heavy metals. Chemical residues in the form of antibiotics, coccidiostats, and larvicides may also be contained in poultry wastes. Although it is well documented that the concentration of these residues in the bird's excreta will correlate to the amount of the chemical used during production and management, there is little information available regarding environmental impacts of these compounds resulting from waste management practices. Poultry wastes may contain certain disease-causing pathogenic microorganisms; however, these organisms have been shown to be decreased or eliminated by management practices that include composting, drying, and sunlight exposure. The primary environmental concern involving land application of pathogen-containing poultry waste includes surface water contamination from runoff. Management practices that include riparian buffer strips adjacent to surface waters near land receiving manure have been documented to reduce pathogens in such runoff. An additional concern involving pathogenic microorganisms in poultry waste is the widespread use, worldwide, of antibiotics in subtherapeutic levels as feed additives to promote animal growth efficiency. This practice may result in the selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are shed in the animal's excreta. Subsequently, it is possible for these pathogens to share antibiotic-resistant plasmids (r-plasmids) with other bacteria. Research has shown that microbial contamination of poultry litter should be reduced or eliminated before reutilization back into the production facility to minimize environmental health risks associated with the transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans or other animals. Recent studies have shown that nutritional strategies may reduce the amount of nutrients excreted in poultry waste without impacting animal productivity. Examples include providing diets with highly digestible amino acids to reduce fecal N excretion and the use of dietary enzymes to reduce P concentrations in excreta. Although more work is needed in this area, such results illustrate the potential for ""econutrition"" to be a significant component of poultry producer waste management strategy in the near future. Alternatives to land application of poultry wastes for agronomic purposes include methods of processing nutrients and energy in the waste for refeeding to livestock or poultry and utilization of the waste for fuel production. Information in the scientific literature shows that poultry waste, litter in particular, can be safely utilized for refeeding to ruminants when pathogens are neutralized and the waste substrate is combined in optimal concentrations with conventional feedstuffs. However, the use of poultry waste as a feed ingredient is not a common practice with the livestock industry. Public, as well as producer, perception of this concept contributes to its limited use as a mechanism for recycling poultry wastes. Biogas generated by the anaerobic digestion of poultry wastes may be used as an energy source for burning as heat or as a fuel for internal combustion engines to generate electricity. This technology has been the subject of much research for the past two decades, and successful systems have been reported for poultry manure digestion. Few producers, however, utilize anaerobic digestion as a method of poultry waste treatment and disposal because of unfavorable economics and technical operational difficulties. New and more efficient techniques for the production of biogas from manure are required to motivate the adoption of this practice as a component of widespread use as a method of managing poultry wastes. Trends in animal agriculture, including poultry production, have evolved away from widespread ""traditional"" small farms. For the past several decades, the population engaged in farming has steadily declined. In the U.S., less than 2% of the population is directly involved with the day-to-day on-farm production of agricultural products. As the number of farms have decreased, so have the total acres of cultivated cropland available for receiving manure nutrients. The combination of decreased available cropland and increased concentration of animal production has resulted in many environmental concerns regarding improper land application of the organic and inorganic nutrients contained in manures. Such changes in animal agricultural necessitate the need for a framework by which agricultural producers, their allied industries, and researchers, educators, and government officials may address these environmental concerns. There is little doubt that, in certain geographic areas, the continued productivity, profitability, and sustainability of animal production agriculture depends on cost-effective technologies and management practices to mitigate environmental consequences associated with air and water quality that are impacted by the excess of nutrients produced by concentrated livestock facilities. Poultry producers have much at stake in ensuring long-term production systems that are environmentally sound. The future sustainability and expansion of animal agriculture in the U.S., and in many other parts of the world, will depend on manure management practices that address environmental concerns related to soil, water, and air quality. The methods employed must also ensure that there is no risk for food chain contamination by pathogenic organisms that are indigenous to manure.  Springer-Verlag 1999."

TB drug-resistance surveillance in this region has been limited by laboratory capacity and the public health infrastructure; however, with the maturation of the HIV epidemic, the burden of drug-resistant TB is increasing rapidly. The recent discovery of large numbers of cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in South Africa likely represents an unrecognized and evolving epidemic rather than sporadic, localized outbreaks. The combination of a large population of HIV-infected susceptible hosts with poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing, and an overburdened MDR-TB treatment program provides ideal conditions for an MDR-TB and XDR-TB epidemic of unparalleled magnitude. In the present article, we review the history of drug-resistant TB in South Africa, describe its interaction with the HIV epidemic and the resultant consequences, and suggest measures necessary for controlling MDR-TB and XDR-TB in this context. A successful response to the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB will necessitate increased resources for and collaboration between TB and HIV programs."

To minimise the risk of cross-contamination, proper cleaning and disinfection is essential for the food industry. Recently, disinfection of areas for preparation and storage of food has also gained increased popularity in households. There is a range of disinfectants available with different properties and usage areas, and care must be taken to choose the proper disinfectant for the specific application. There are many methods for testing the antimicrobial effect of disinfectants. To evaluate whether a disinfectant will be effective in practical settings, the test method should model real-life situations. Most disinfectants are effective against Salmonella at recommended user concentration in suspension tests. However, a number of factors may reduce the biocidal effect of disinfectants under practical conditions. This include properties of the surface to be disinfected, presence of soiling on the surface, the physiological state of the bacteria exposed to disinfection, including bacteria embedded in biofilms, and the effects of other stresses (e.g. desiccation, starvation and temperature). Here we review the effects of disinfectants used in food related areas in industries and in households against Salmonella. A general overview is given for disinfectants in use and methods used to evaluate effects. Effects of disinfectants against Salmonella in suspension and on surfaces, including biofilms, are presented and compared. Novel control strategies such as use of electrolysed water, antimicrobial surfaces, and anti-biofilm compounds are also covered. Finally, we review the ability of Salmonella to gain reduced susceptibility to disinfectants through adaptation and other physiological responses like biofilm formation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Bacteria at high concentrations in the air can compromise indoor air quality (IAQ) and result in many diseases. In tropical environments like Malaysia that extensively utilize air-conditioning systems, this is particularly significant due to continuous recirculation of indoor air and the potential implications for human health. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of airborne bacteria on IAQ in Malaysia. This study was prompted by a need for reliable baseline data on airborne bacteria in the indoor environment of tropical equatorial Malaysia, that may be used as a reference for further investigations on the potential role played by airborne bacteria as an agent of disease in this region. It was further necessitated due to the threat of bioterrorism with the potentiality of release of exotic pathogenic microorganisms into indoor or outdoor air. Before scientists can detect the latter, a gauge of the common microorganisms in indoor (as well as outdoor) air needs to be ascertained, hence the expediency of this study. Bacterial counts from the broad-based and targeted study were generally n the order of 102 colony-forming units (CFU) per m(3) of air. The most prevalent airborne bacteria found in the broad-based study that encompassed all five levels of the building were Gram-positive cocci (67.73\%), followed by Gram-positive rods (24.26\%) and Gram-negative rods (7.10\%). Gram-negative cocci were rarely detected (0.71\%). Amongst the genera identified, Kytococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Leifsonia sp., Bacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. predominated in indoor air. The most dominant bacterial species were Kytococcus sedentarius, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus. The opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also discovered at a high percentage in the cafeteria. The bacteria isolated in this study have been increasingly documented to cause opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised patients, sometimes with fatal outcomes. Furthermore, some of them are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Hence, we propose that indoor reservoirs of these bacteria and their associated clinical and more subtle health effects, if any, be investigated further."

Among them, volatile molecules produced under various growth conditions were shown to mediate cross-kingdom interactions with plants, nematodes, and fungi. Although the role of volatile compounds in bacterial biology is not well understood, recent reports indicated that they could play a role in airborne interactions between bacteria and influence antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence. In this study, we investigated long-distance effects of 14 previously described Escherichia coli volatile compounds upon the bacteria E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis. We show that several of these molecules constitute chemical cues influencing growth, adhesion, and motility in exposed bacteria. Moreover, we show that aerial exposure to trimethylamine (TMA), a volatile compound produced in animal intestines and tissues upon biogenic reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), modifies the antibiotic resistance profiles of all tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We demonstrate that the TMA mode of action is distinct from that previously described for ammonia and results from nonspecific transient alteration of antibiotic uptake due to pH increase in the environment of bacteria aerially exposed to TMA. Our study therefore presents a new way by which volatile compounds can affect community behavior and structure in physically separated bacteria. It further demonstrates that bacterial gases and volatile compounds mediate chemical interactions, triggering functional responses that play an important role in the development of bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE Bacteria release many different volatile compounds during food transformation and fermentation. Here we sought to investigate the role of several bacterial volatile molecules released by Escherichia coli during long-distance airborne interactions with other bacteria. While several tested volatiles affect bacterial motility and surface adhesion, we show that aerial exposure to trimethylamine, a molecule produced by E. coli and many other Gram-negative bacteria in animal intestines and infected tissues, also modulates antibiotic resistance in all tested bacteria. We demonstrate that exposure to trimethylamine increases the pH of the growth medium of exposed bacteria, resulting in modifications in antibiotic uptake and transient alteration of antibiotic resistance. Our study therefore presents a new mechanism by which volatile compounds can affect community behavior and structure in physically separated bacteria, and it illustrates how airborne chemical interactions between bacteria contribute to the development of bacterial communities."

Standardised, multicountry data are required to better understand the nature and burden of disease in Africa. We aimed to measure the adjusted incidence estimates of typhoid fever and invasive non-typhoidal salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa, and the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the causative agents. Methods We established a systematic, standardised surveillance of blood culture-based febrile illness in 13 African sentinel sites with previous reports of typhoid fever: Burkina Faso (two sites), Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Madagascar (two sites), Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, and Tanzania (two sites). We used census data and health-care records to define study catchment areas and populations. Eligible participants were either inpatients or outpatients who resided within the catchment area and presented with tympanic (>= 38.0 degrees C) or axillary temperature (>= 37.5 degrees C). Inpatients with a reported history of fever for 72 h or longer were excluded. We also implemented a health-care utilisation survey in a sample of households randomly selected from each study area to investigate health-seeking behaviour in cases of self-reported fever lasting less than 3 days. Typhoid fever and iNTS disease incidences were corrected for health-care-seeking behaviour and recruitment. Findings Between March 1, 2010, and Jan 31, 2014, 135 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) and 94 iNTS isolates were cultured from the blood of 13 431 febrile patients. Salmonella spp accounted for 33\% or more of all bacterial pathogens at nine sites. The adjusted incidence rate (AIR) of S Typhi per 100 000 person-years of observation ranged from 0 (95\% CI 0-0) in Sudan to 383 (274-535) at one site in Burkina Faso; the AIR of iNTS ranged from 0 in Sudan, Ethiopia, Madagascar (Isotry site), and South Africa to 237 (178-316) at the second site in Burkina Faso. The AIR of iNTS and typhoid fever in individuals younger than 15 years old was typically higher than in those aged 15 years or older. Multidrug-resistant S Typhi was isolated in Ghana, Kenya, and Tanzania (both sites combined), and multidrug-resistant iNTS was isolated in Burkina Faso (both sites combined), Ghana, Kenya, and Guinea-Bissau. Interpretation Typhoid fever and iNTS disease are major causes of invasive bacterial febrile illness in the sampled locations, most commonly affecting children in both low and high population density settings. The development of iNTS vaccines and the introduction of S Typhi conjugate vaccines should be considered for high-incidence settings, such as those identified in this study.

Tuberculosis chemotherapy began in 1944 with the introduction of streptomycin and para-amino-salicylic acid, later augmented by isoniazid. Early experience taught physicians that treatment must be given with multiple drugs to prevent emergence of resistance and that prolonged treatment adherence for 18-24 months was needed for a permanent cure of tuberculosis. Between 1970 and 1980 rifampicin was introduced and with pyrazinamide it made ``short-course{''} treatment possible. For 30 years, a 6-month directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) based on the three compounds isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was the foundation of tuberculosis control strategies world-wide, and in recent years this was supplemented with ethambutol in view of increasing rates of isoniazid resistance. However, even 6 months of treatment is too long to easily ensure the compliance necessary to permanently cure tuberculosis. The recent spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has placed tuberculosis programmes under severe pressure and is accompanied by an increase in drug-resistance making tuberculosis virtually untreatable in some instances. In 2004 the first of a new generation of anti-tuberculosis drugs entered clinical evaluation. A series of clinical trials, often conducted at sites in Cape Town, South Africa, has shown them to be efficacious and hold promise of being able to shorten tuberculosis treatment and treat drug-resistant tuberculosis. Development and assessment of these drugs is ongoing but there is renewed hope that these new drugs and regimens will assist in finally conquering tuberculosis, preventing a return to Magic Mountain where sunshine and fresh air was all that could be offered to patients."

Using air-liquid interface cultures of primary human sinonasal and bronchial cells, we imaged ciliary beat frequency (CBF), intracellular calcium, and nitric oxide (NO). Exposure to aflatoxins (0.1 to 10 mu M; 5 to 10 minutes) reduced baseline (similar to 6-12\%) and agonist-stimulated CBF.

The design and construction aspects of the RBP source are presented, including the electrode configuration, electrical, cooling, and gas flow aspects. The RBP jet is tested, and its characteristics such as the propagation velocity of the plasma jet, electrical properties, plasma gas temperature, and nitric oxide concentration are characterized using optical laser plasma shadowgraphy, voltage-current characterization, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and gas analyzer diagnostic measurements, respectively. Using a laser shadowgraphy diagnostic, we have measured the average propagation velocity of the plasma jet to be 150-200 m/s at 1 cm from the probe end. The discharge power is calculated from voltage-current characterization, and the plasma power is 26.33 W. An OES was applied, and the gas temperature which is equivalent to the nitrogen rotational (Trot) temperatures was measured. After approximately 2 cm from the tip, along the axis, the plasma emission drops, and the high-temperature ceramic fiber-insulated-wire thermocouple probe was used to measure the temperatures of the gas flows along the downstream jet. The addition of a small portable external cooling unit has brought the temperatures of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other gases close to room temperature at the tip of the handheld plasma source unit. The concentrations of the ROS at different spatial distances from the tip of the plasma jet were measured; at a 5-cm distance from the electrode, the nitric oxide level was measured to be in the range of 500-660 ppm, and it drops to similar to 100 ppm at 60 cm. The parts-per-million values of nitric oxides after the cooling unit are observed to be of the same order of magnitude as compared to that of the plasma jet. The portable RBP source was tested to be very effective for the decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of food-borne and opportunistic nosocomial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus, and the preliminary results are presented.

Strategies to prevent VAP are likely to be successful only if based upon a sound understanding of pathogenesis and epidemiology. The major route for acquiring endemic VAP is oropharyngeal colonization by the endogenous flora or by pathogens acquired exogenously from the intensive care unit environment, especially the hands or apparel of health-care workers, contaminated respiratory equipment, hospital water, or air. The stomach represents a potential site of secondary colonization and reservoir of nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli. Endotracheal-tube biofilm formation may play a contributory role in sustaining tracheal colonization and also have an important role in late-onset VAP caused by resistant organisms. Aspiration of microbe-laden oropharyngeal, gastric, or tracheal secretions around the cuffed endotracheal tube into the normally sterile lower respiratory tract results in most cases of endemic VAP. In contrast, epidemic VAP is most often caused by contamination of respiratory therapy equipment, bronchoscopes, medical aerosols, water (eg, Legionella) or air (eg, Aspergillus or the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus). Strategies to eradicate oropharyngeal and/or intestinal microbial colonization, such as with chlorhexidine oral care, prophylactic aerosolization of antimicrobials, selective aerodigestive mucosal antimicrobial decontamination, or the use of sucralfate rather than H(2) antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and measures to prevent aspiration, such as semirecumbent positioning or continuous subglottic suctioning, have all been shown to reduce the risk of VAP. Measures to prevent epidemic VAP include rigorous disinfection of respiratory equipment and bronchoscopes, and infection-control measures to prevent contamination of medical aerosols. Hospital water should be Legionella-free, and high-risk patients, especially those with prolonged granulocytopenia or organ transplants, should be cared for in hospital units with high-efficiency-particulate-arrestor (HEPA) filtered air. Routine surveillance of VAP, to track endemic VAPs and facilitate early detection of outbreaks, is mandatory."

However, the rate of decline is too slow to reach all the epidemiological impact targets set for 2015. The prospects for reaching the TB elimination target set for 2050 are even bleaker. Implementation of the World Health Organization's Stop TB Strategy is currently lagging behind the envisioned scale-up pace, particularly with regard to TB/HIV collaborative activities and management of drug resistant TB. To ensure long-term TB control there is, first, a need to ensure that all components of the Stop TB Strategy are scaled up according to plans, with special attention to improved access for the poor. However, this may not be enough. Recent analyses suggest that the impact of current efforts to reduce TB incidence is less than expected and that improved diagnostic and curative efforts need to be combined with additional preventive efforts. New and more effective vaccines and drugs for preventive treatment would revolutionize TB control. A stronger focus on prevention would also entail more concerted actions to limit the impact of TB risk factors, including HIV/AIDS, smoking, malnutrition, alcoholism, diabetes, crowded living conditions, and indoor air pollution, which may all contribute a considerable proportion of the global TB burden.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to demonstrate the applicability of atmospheric plasma at room temperature for inactivating C. albicans growing in biofilms without thermally damaging heat-sensitive materials. This so-called cold atmospheric plasma is produced by applying high voltage to accelerate electrons, which ionize the surrounding air, leading to the production of charged particles, reactive species, and photons. A newly developed plasma device was used, which exhibits a large plasma-generating surface area of 9 by 13 cm (117 cm(2)). Different time points were selected to achieve an optimum inactivation efficacy range of >= 3 log(10) to 5 log(10) reduction in CFU per milliliter, and the results were compared with those of 70\% ethanol.

Early diagnosis and treatment of active TB remains the top priority in resource-poor countries with high TB prevalence. Notwithstanding, because LTBI contributes significantly to the pool of active TB cases later on, its diagnosis and treatment is essential, especially in high-risk groups. The lack of a gold standard and several limitations of currently available tools, namely the tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays, are major constraints for LTBI diagnosis. In areas with high TB prevalence, interferon-gamma release assays have not shown superiority over the conventional tuberculin skin test and are yet to be systematically studied. Decisions regarding LTBI treatment with isoniazid preventive therapy should be made, keeping in mind the high prevalence of isoniazid resistance in these settings. Although efforts to shorten the LTBI treatment duration are encouraging, most trials have focused on adherence and toxicity. Future trials on short-duration regimens in high-burden settings should address drug efficacy issues as well. LTBI management, therefore, should comprise a targeted screening approach and individualization of LTBI treatment protocols. In addition, efforts should focus on airborne infection control measures in high-burden countries. A high prevalence of drug-resistant TB, the HIV epidemic, and delays in the diagnosis of active TB cases are other major concerns in areas of high TB prevalence. There is ample space for further research in these countries, whose outcomes may strengthen future national guidelines. CHEST 2012; 142(3):761-773"

Mostly patients are identified in high- burden countries when they visit health care facilities ('passive case finding'). Contacts of tuberculosis patients are a high- risk group for developing the disease. Actively screening contacts of people with confirmed tuberculosis may improve case detection rates and control of the disease. Objectives This study aims to compare whether active case finding among contacts of people with confirmed tuberculosis increases case detection compared to usual practice. Search strategy In April 2011 we searched CENTRAL ( T h e Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and mRCT. We also checked article reference lists, the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and contacted relevant researchers and organizations. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi- randomized trials of active case finding to detect tuberculosis disease among close and casual contacts of patients with microbiologically proven pulmonary tuberculosis ( by sputum smear and/or culture). Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed eligibility and the methodological quality of the trials that were extracted using a search method that was outlined previously. Main results No trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. One RCT did test the effect of active case finding in contacts, but the intervention in that trial also included screening for, and treatment of, LTBI in contacts; and the separate effect of active case finding could not be estimated. Authors' conclusions There are currently insufficient data from randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of active case finding for tuberculosis among contacts of patients with confirmed disease. While observational studies show that contacts have a higher risk of developing tuberculosis than the general population, further research is needed to determine whether active case finding among contacts significantly increases case detection rates."

In most developing countries of the world these antibiotics are not readily affordable, thus making compliance difficult. This calls for research into alternative sources of antimicrobials. Dialium guineense is a shrub of the family Leguminosae. Its stem bark is used for the treatment of cough, toothache, and bronchitis. AIMS: Despite the acclaimed efficacy of D guineense, there is no scientific evidence in its support. This work was carried out to assess the antimicrobial activity of D guineense in vitro against some clinical isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: D guineense stem bark was collected and 50 gm of air-dried and powdered stem bark of the plant was soaked for 72 hours in 1 l of each of the six solvents used in this study. Each mixture was refluxed, agitated at 200 rpm for 1 hour, filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and, finally, freeze dried. The extracts were then tested for antimicrobial activity using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: The highest percentage yield of 23.2% was obtained with ethanol. Phytochemical screening showed that D guineense contains anthraquinone, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts revealed a broad spectrum of activity, with Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureusa showing the greatest zones of inhibition (18.0 mm). Only Candida albicans among the fungi tested was inhibited by the extract. The greatest zone of inhibition among the fractions was 16.0 mm. D guineense exhibited bactericidal activity at the 7th and 9th hours against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. aureus 25923 while the 10th hour against S. typhi and C. albicans. The greatest activity was noted against S pneumoniae, where there was reduced viable cell count after 6 hours of exposure. CONCLUSION: Stem bark extract of D guineense (Wild.) has the potential to be developed into an antimicrobial agent."

It is important to elucidate the stringency of bottlenecks during transmission to shed light on mechanisms that underlie the evolution and propagation of antigenic drift, host range switching or drug resistance. The virus spreads between people by different routes, including through the air in droplets and aerosols, and by direct contact. By housing ferrets under different conditions, it is possible to mimic various routes of transmission. Here, we inoculated donor animals with a mixture of two viruses whose genomes differed by one or two reverse engineered synonymous mutations, and measured the transmission of the mixture to exposed sentinel animals. Transmission through the air imposed a tight bottleneck since most recipient animals became infected by only one virus. In contrast, a direct contact transmission chain propagated a mixture of viruses suggesting the dose transferred by this route was higher. From animals with a mixed infection of viruses that were resistant and sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir, resistance was propagated through contact transmission but not by air. These data imply that transmission events with a looser bottleneck can propagate minority variants and may be an important route for influenza evolution."

Appropriate treatment must be started as soon as a diagnosis of tuberculosis meningitis is suspected. The main aims of the drug treatment of tuberculosis meningitis are the eradication of the causative organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the control of raised intracranial pressure, and modulation of the immune processes causing cerebral vasculitis and the associated exudate at the base of the brain, Isoniazid, rifampicin (rifampin) and pyrazinamide are essential drugs in the treatment of tuberculosis meningitis in dosages of 20 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. Lower dosages of isoniazid (10 mg/kg/day) and rifampicin (10 mg/kg/day) can be used if infectious hepatitis is a recognised problem in a particular geographical area, but a reduction in the dose of rifampicin may compromise its sterilising capacity, If it is possible that the disease is caused by drug-resistant organisms, the above regimen should br augmented by ethionamide 20 mg/kg/day or streptomycin 20 to 40 mg/kg/day. Treatment must be continued for a minimum of 6 months, but should be extended to 9 or 12 months if rifampicin cannot be used throughout and if pyrazinamide cannot be used for the first 2 months of treatment. Hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure frequently complicate stage II and stage III tuberculosis meningitis. In the presence of communicating hydrocephalus, confirmed on air encephalogram by the appearance of air in the ventricles, furosemide (frusemide) 1 mg/kg/day and acetazolamide 100 mg/kg/day given in 6- or 8-hourly divided doses will expedite the normalisation of intracranial pressure in the majority of cases. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunting should be undertaken immediately in those children with non-communicating hydrocephalus, demonstrated on air encephalogram by the presence of air at the base of the brain but not in the ventricles, and in those children who do not respond satisfactorily to medical management. Corticosteroids, in the form of prednisone or dexamethasone, have been shown to improve both morbidity and mortality in tuberculosis meningitis. These drugs should be given for the first month of treatment."

Dexmedetomidine (Dex) has been recently evaluated in a few small series for its effect on the electrocorticographic spikes intra-operatively. Methods: In this prospective study, electrocorticogram (ECoG) was monitored during dexnnedetomidine infusion in 34 patients (M: F = 23:11, age = 29.2 +/- 10.9 years; duration of epilepsy = 15.3 +/- 8.9 years) undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection with amygdalohippocampectomy for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (Right: 18, Left: 16). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental/propofol and maintained with oxygen-N2O-isoflurane. ECoG was recorded for 5 min after the end tidal MAC of N2O and isoflurane were decreased to zero; anesthesia was maintained with 02:Air = 50:50, vecuronium and fentanyl. ECoG was recorded using a 4-contact strip electrode for: (a) 5 min prior to dexmedetomidine (PreDEX), (b) 5 min during dexmedetomidine infusion (DEX; 1 mu g/kg) and (c) 5 min after stopping dexmedetomidine (PostDEX). Results: The ECoG spikes were manually counted in all the channels. The mean spike rate in the 2 channels with maximum spikes (MAX CH A and MAX CH B) was normalized to a 3-min duration. RM-ANOVA and post hoc comparison of three phases were used to compare the spike rates. The mean spike rate during Dex phase was higher compared to preDEX (MAX CH B: p = 0.007 and MAX CH A: p = 0.079) and PostDEX (MAX CH B: p = 0.17, MAX CH A: p = 0.79) phases. The spike rate increased in 67.6\% patients, while 11.8\% patients showed <= 25\% reduction and 20.6\% patients showed >25\% reduction in spike frequency. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine is useful during intra-operative ECoG recording in epilepsy surgery as it enhances or does not alter spike rate in most of the cases, without any major adverse effects.

Imported cases to non-endemic countries often result in delays in diagnosis, are expensive to treat, and can sometimes cause secondary local transmission. The movement of malaria in endemic countries has also contributed to the spread of drug resistance and threatens long-term eradication goals. Here we focused on quantifying the international movements of malaria to improve our understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the design of mitigation strategies. Methods In this meta-analysis, we studied the database of publicly available nationally reported statistics on imported malaria in the past 10 years, covering more than 50 000 individual cases. We obtained data from 40 non-endemic countries and recorded the geographical variations. Findings Infection movements were strongly skewed towards a small number of high-traffic routes between 2005 and 2015, with the west Africa region accounting for 56\% (13 947/24 941) of all imported cases to non-endemic countries with a reported travel destination, and France and the UK receiving the highest number of cases, with more than 4000 reported cases per year on average. Countries strongly linked by movements of imported cases are grouped by historical, language, and travel ties. There is strong spatial clustering of plasmodium species types. Interpretation The architecture of the air network, historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria endemicity contribute to highly heterogeneous patterns of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites transported. With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, malaria control altering local transmission, and the threat of drug resistance, understanding these patterns and their drivers is increasing in importance.

Gram-negative bacteria were identified as a causative organism in relatively small number of cases. Although, antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli is common cause of gram-negative endocarditis, AmpC beta-lactamase (BL)-harboring E coli is very rare cause of IE. Furthermore, emphysematous endocarditis is also a very rare manifestation of E coli infection. Patientconcerns: We report a case of 80-year-old female patient presenting with dizziness, fever, and altered mental status, who was finally diagnosed with emphysematous endocarditis caused by E coli harboring an AmpC BL gene. Diagnosis: Her chest computed tomography revealed air bubbles surrounding the annulus of a mitral valve and a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a hyperechogenic mass fixed on the posteromedial side of the mitral annulus with 2 eccentric mitral regurgitation jets. Blood cultures grew E coli which harbored the DHA-type AmpC BL. The organism belonged to a B2 phylogenic group, and multilocus sequence typing analyses revealed that the strains were of ST-95. Interventions: She was treated with meropenem following the resistant profiles, and surgery was recommended by the healthcare professional, but denied by the patient's guardians.

All samples were tested by the GB 4789.40-2010 to isolate Enterobacter sakazakii, the ompA virulence genes were detected to identify Enterobacter sakazakii by PCR; four virulence genes (sip, hly, cpa and ompX) were examined by PCR; antimicrobial susceptibility were tested by using agar dilution methods. Results: In total 29 samples of the 14 ested locations out of 27 were positive for Enterobacter sakazakii. The detection rate and the contamination rate was 51.9% and 16.1%, respectively. Positive samples mainly concentrate in the powder samples (23.5%) and swabs samples (16.9%). The rate of virulence gene was 100%. The detection rates of virulence genotypes carrying cpa-ompX and cpa-hly-ompX were 79.3% and 20.7%, respectively. The resistant rates of 29 isolates for respective antibiotics were ri-fampicin (100%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75.9%), cefoxitin (6.9%), amoxicillin (3.4%), amoxicillin/clavulanic (3.4%). All isolates were sensitive to the other 11 kinds of antibiotics. Multiple antimicrobial resistant rate was 6.9%. Conclusion: Enterobacter sakazakii exist in the goat milk powder factory quiet easily. Distribution may be assisted by air flow, dust pollution, personnel during processing and the no thorough cleaning and disinfection of production equipment. The isolates carry a high rate of virulence genes and are sensitive to most tested antibiotics, while exist multiple antimicrobial resistance. , 2015, Chinese Institute of Food Science and Technology.

With the development of drug resistance, travelers can no longer rely on chemoprophylaxis alone for absolute protection against malaria; they need to take a number of complementary measures. The most important among these are steps to prevent mosquito bites (mosquito screens and nets impregnated with insecticide, insecticides and repellents in various formulations; nocturnal air-conditioning) which can be instituted anywhere. Chemoprophylaxis must be adapted in each case with regard to individual characteristics (laboratory and medical status), the drug used (contraindications, side effects) and the travel itinerary (departure date, places to be visited, duration of journey). The back-up treatment prescribed for a traveler before his departure is intended as cover in the event that the chemoprophylaxis used should prove to be ineffective. If people planning trips to malarious regions are to apply preventive measures, they have to be informed, aware and motivated. Information is an integral part of prevention. Objective, scientifically accurate information is provided by specialized centres and official bodies in the form of recommendations subject to regular updating. A recommendation of a nonmedical nature must be given by travel agents and tour operators, by airlines and shipping companies, embassies and consulates, and also by the media at peak periods of travel to the tropics.

In addition, the differential antibiotic resistance of these actinomycetes is also utilized. (i) To isolate streptosporangia, an air-dried soil sample is first subjected to dry heat treatment (120-degrees-C, 1 h). A water suspension of the heated sample is then treated with 0.01\% BC, diluted and cultured on HV agar supplemented with nalidixic acid and leucomycin. (ii) To isolate dactylosporangia, a water suspension of a soil sample given dry heat and 0.03\% BC treatment is cultured on HV agar supplemented with nalidixic acid and tunicamycin. The dry heat and BC treatment drastically eliminated bacteria and unwanted actinomycetes contaminants, including streptomycetes, from the isolation plates, thereby facilitating the selective isolation of streptosporangia and dactylosporangia. Nalidixic acid in HV agar was useful to suppress the growth of dry heat- and BC-resistant bacteria. The use of leucomycin and tunicamycin increased the selectivity of HV agar for streptosporangia and dactylosporangia, respectively, through elimination of the growth of unwanted actinomycetes which remained after the employment of pretreatments. From various field soils (vegetable, orchard, corn, and rice paddy), the methods described above consistently achieved the highly selective isolation of streptosporangia and dactylosporangia, respectively, as each group accounted for more than 20\% of the total number of colonies recovered."

For shigella cases Ankara had seasonal alterations in July and August being the peak months. Americans, disease followed that course exactly. The big difference was being the local people of the city had those epidemics with the flexneri strains but Americans had them with the sonnei strains. To show the possible sources which could infect the community time to time and make sonnei predominant yielded negative result. All the patients stools were cultured. Sensitivity studies employing ""plate disk diffusion"" techniques were done. All patients treated accordingly. Stools checked for routine carriership exams. None become a chronic carrier. American installations had their shops, clubs, mess halls. The food handlers of these places had checked routinely by the preventive medicine office. None found infected. Only at 1963 the amount of flexneri isolations were higher than sonnei. All the remaining years sonnei were predominant. Antibiotic sensitivity studies showed no differences between subtypes.

In 2006, tuberculosis killed 1.7 million people--almost twice as many people as malaria--and it is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. This is all the more tragic because these deaths are preventable. For a long time the world thought that we had defeated tuberculosis, but just because tuberculosis doesn't make headlines doesn't mean it has gone away. The fact is that tuberculosis is getting worse, as complacency and lack of adequate tools and funding fuel the disease and the spread of drug resistance. Drug resistant tuberculosis is the wake-up call, it is an airborne epidemic of increasingly untreatable disease. Drug resistant tuberculosis develops when tuberculosis patients take low-quality drugs, do not finish their full course of treatment, or pass drug resistant tuberculosis from one person to another. In 2007, there were approximately 500,000 cases of drug resistant tuberculosis globally. MDR-TB is resistant to the two most commonly used first-line TB drugs, and requires long, complex and expensive treatment. XDR-TB is resistant to first- and second-line drugs, severely limiting treatment options. While progress is being made, much more is needed. Basic tuberculosis control is one of the most cost-effective interventions in global health. Appropriate treatment can save a life and stop the spread of disease for US$14. It is essential that countries implement the World Health Organization's (WHO) internationally recommended Stop TB strategy, which includes DOTS. But due to outdated tools and methods, DOTS alone is not enough. The remarkable fact is that global control of tuberculosis, a disease that kills someone every 20 seconds, depends upon a 125-year-old test, an 85-year-old vaccine and drugs that take six months to cure and haven't changed in four decades. To successfully treat tuberculosis and prevent resistance, we need to use current tools better and accelerate the development of new tools for the future. Simple improvements in tuberculosis control, such as expanding the use of under-utilized technologies, can have enormous impact. Fixed-dose combinations have existed for over 25 years, and could help ensure that more patients complete treatment; yet globally, only 15 percent of patients are using them. We also need new drugs, vaccines and diagnostics, as well as innovations in tuberculosis control and case management. Better diagnostics are already available, and new drugs and vaccines are coming. But more commitment and resources are needed. Better prevention and control of tuberculosis is the surest way to stop drug resistance. To ensure that drug resistance does not pose a wider threat, we need to employ a number of equally important approaches. These include improved basic tuberculosis control, increased use of underutilized technologies such as fixed-dose combinations, and new technologies and health systems innovations. At the same time, we should expand access to M/XDR-TB treatment and diagnostics for those who already have drug resistant tuberculosis. Some of the most innovative solutions can come from the private sector and through partnerships. An untapped market of two billion people carries the tuberculosis bacterium. Since tuberculosis requires a comprehensive approach, companies should also explore opportunities to work together and pool complementary technologies to ensure new tools are used most effectively. Japan is poised to play a leading role in the discovery, development and delivery of tuberculosis solutions in the 21st century."

Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are responsible for less than 30\% of cases; however, their rapidity of infection and virulence often results in poor visual outcome despite prompt antibiotic treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate an outbreak of post-cataract surgery P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis in India. Design: Hospital-based case series. Participants: Twenty patients with acute postoperative enclophthalmitis who underwent cataract surgery at one of the peripheral centers of Joseph Eye Hospital, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India, from February 23 to April 2, 2008. Interventions: Vitreous aspirates and environmental surveillance specimens were inoculated for culture. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by agar diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) primers (ERIC-PCR) was used to establish the clonal relationship between clinical and environmental isolates. Main Outcome Measures: Post-cataract surgery P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis. Results: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 20 eyes with postoperative enclophthalmitis, the phacoemulsifier's internal tubes, the povidone-iodine solution, and the operating theater air-conditioning system. All strains were multidrug-resistant to cefazolin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and fluoro-quinolones; conversely, most of them were susceptible to polymyxin B. Polymerase chain reaction with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus primers disclosed 2 major clusters: six genetically identical clinical isolates shared 94\% of similarity with the air-conditioning isolate; 11 other clinical isolates had 88\% of similarity with the former strain. Despite the prompt use of intravitreal antibiotics, 10 patients had evisceration or phthisis of the affected eye. Conclusions: The outcome of cataract surgery-related P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis is poor. The detection of multidrug-resistant isolates is a serious problem, jeopardizing an appropriate choice of treatment. Polymerase chain reaction with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus results strongly suggest that the main source of infection in this outbreak was the contaminated air-conditioning system. Polymerase chain reaction with enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus is an inexpensive, fast, reproducible, and discriminatory DNA typing tool for effective epidemiologic surveillance of clinical and environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa."

A. baumannii was also detected in 17\% (7/42) and 2\% (1/42) of surface and water samples, respectively. A total of 40 A. baumannii isolates were recovered and analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility showed the highest resistance towards ceftazidime (92.5\%, 37/40). 85\% (34/40) and 80\% (32/40) of the isolates were also resistant to imipenem and gentamicin, respectively. Resistance genes analysis showed that 77.5\% (31/40) strains contained OXA-23 and 5\% (2/40) strains contained OXA-24, but OXA-58 was not detected in any of the strains. Conclusion: Detection of antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in various samples revealed that hospital environments could act as a potential source for transmission of A. baumannii infections especially in ICUs. These results emphasize the importance of early detection and implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of A. baumannii in hospital environments."

It is also found in the atmosphere, with higher altitudes containing higher levels of ozone. It is found in the stratosphere where it absorbs various ultraviolet radiation. Ozone is also an environmental air pollutant along with others such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Ozone can react with air and create nitrogen dioxide, another air pollutant if it is improperly generated. In spite of this, ozone can be generated by medical devices for therapeutic purposes. Potential medical applications of ozone therapy have a wide range including 1) limiting postoperative pain after dental extraction when used as a gel, 2) repairing inner ear damage caused by acoustic trauma, 3) reducing coronary stent restenosis when applied as an auto-hem-transfusion, and 4) enhancing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus elimination in mediastinitis when used in conjunction with antibiotics. Outside of medicine, ozone has been proposed for use in various settings such as in the pretreatment of textile wastewater. While ozone itself can cause health troubles, it can also react with chemicals found in a multitude of products to lead to other potentially toxic substances such as formaldehyde. Despite proponents for its use and the potential applications, toxicity can occur even at environmental levels and may be related to cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic events. With the wide range of possible applications and toxicity that can occur at environmental levels from within a home, research on ozone use and toxicity is likely to increase in the future."

Inflammation during exacerbations is heterogeneous. It may be associated with bronchial hypereosinophilia, which is used as a predictive marker for exacerbation, and with neutrophilia, which is more resistant to corticosteroids. During viral infection, an inappropriate Th1 antiviral inflammation develops, associated with the intrinsic Th2 activity that leads to an aberrant immune response. Exacerbations secondary to allergen exposure are classically described as due to a Th2-type inflammation; but Th1 response also seems to play a role. Exposure to air pollutants appears able not only to induce bronchial inflammation but also to potentiate the inflammatory reactions of patients with exacerbations."

APEC are found in the intestinal microflora of healthy birds and most of the diseases associated with them are secondary to environmental and host predisposing factors. APEC isolates commonly belong to certain serogroups, O1, O2 and O78, and to a restricted number of clones. Several experimental models have been developed, permitting a more reliable evaluation of the pathogenicity of E. coli for chickens and turkeys. Hence, virulence factors identified on APEC are adhesins such as the F1 and P fimbriae, and curli, the aerobactin iron sequestering system, K1 capsule, temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin (Tsh), resistance to the bactericidal effects of serum and cytotoxic effects. Experimental infection studies have shown that the air-exchange regions of the lung and the airsacs are important sites of entry of E. coli into the bloodstream of birds during the initial stages of infection and that resistance to phagocytosis may be an important mechanism in the development of the disease. They have also demonstrated that F1 fimbriae are expressed in the respiratory tract, whereas P fimbriae are expressed in the internal organs of infected chickens. The role of these fimbrial adhesins in the development of disease is not yet, however, fully understood. The more recent use of genetic approaches for the identification of new virulence factors will greatly enhance our knowledge of APEC pathogenic mechanisms. Diagnosis of APEC infections is based on the clinical picture, lesions and isolation of E. coli. This may be strengthened by serotyping and identification of virulence factors using immunological or molecular methods such as DNA probes and PCR. Approaches for the prevention and control of APEC infections include the control of environmental contamination and environmental parameters such as humidity and ventilation. Antibiotherapy is widely used, although APEC are frequently resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. Vaccines containing killed or attenuated virulent bacteria protect against infection with the homologous strain but are less efficient against heterologous strains. Hence, vaccination for colibacillosis is not widely practised because of the large variety of serogroups involved in field outbreaks."

BCPX forms a stable film at the air-water interface and induces a condensing effect of the DPPC monolayer. A basic thermodynamic analysis was performed which suggests a possible segregation of the drug at the lowest proportion studied. The temperature dependence of 3-(4-(6-phenyl)-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)phenylpropionic acid fluorescence anisotropy measurements shows that the incorporation of CPX or BCPX into bilayers does not greatly modify the DPPC lamellar gel state. In the liquid-crystalline phase, BCPX lowered the anisotropy values and both drugs lowered the main transition temperature (T-m) of pure DPPC by approximately 1 degreesC. On the other hand, significant changes in the cooperativity of the phospholipid transition were found only in the presence of BCPX. In P-31-NMR experiments the presence of BCPX induced, both below and above the main transition, a strong line shape narrowing of the DPPC spectra that suggests an increase in the local mobility of the phosphate groups; that is, the interactions between DPPC headgroups are altered by the presence of BCPX. Although the incorporation of CPX also promotes a remarkable line shape narrowing in the fluid phase, it only slightly modifies the spectral parameters of DPPC in the gel phase. This suggests that CPX could be ``squeezed out{''} or segregated from the lipid-water interface when the phospholipids are in this tight packed phase. The segregation is likely to occur to defects on the gel phase. Values of 1-anilino-8-\textbackslash{}naphthalenes sulfonate binding to the liposome surface were fitted to a Freundlich-like isotherm. The binding constant (K) and maximum concentration bound to liposomes (C-m) both are dependent on the structure of the drugs, which indicates a definite effect due to the drug hydrophobicity. K values in the presence and absence of drug were used to calculate the variation in the surface potential (AT) of the liposomes, All the results are consistent with an electrostatic interaction of 6-fluoroquinolones at the lipid-water interface. This interaction is favored by the presence of the N-4-butyl chain and could have important implications in the efflux of this drug from bacteria."

This analysis relies on the use of a pulsed ion beam to ionize surface molecules that can be extracted into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. By combining the pulsed ion beam with another ion beam in direct current (DC) mode, depth profiles are obtained as a result of consecutive removal of surface layers. The spatial resolution of the depth profile along the y-axis is in the range of a few nanometres, and the spatial resolution along the x- and z-axes is in the mum range. The ToF-SIMS analysis was performed on crude biofilms of bacteria air-dried at aluminium foil surfaces, allowing subcellular resolution along the y-axis. The mercury ions were found transformed to methylmercury preferably in the periplasmic space, and the arsenate ions were found reduced to arsenite inside the cells, close to the cell membrane.

Recently, surgical management is increasing and shows promise. We analyzed our experience to identify the benefits and complications of pulmonary resection in MDR pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: A retrospective review was performed in 27 patients undergoing pulmonary resection for MDR pulmonary tuberculosis between January 1994 and March 1998. Their average ages were 40 years and were diagnosed a median of 15 months before surgery. All patients had resistance to an average of 4.3 drugs including isoniazid and rifampin, and had received second line drugs selected according to drug sensitivity test preoperatively. Most patients (92.6\%) had cavitary lesions. Bilateral lesions were also identified in 19 patients (70.4\%), but the main focus was recognized in one side of the lung. Most patients were indicated to operation for those who could not achieve negative sputum despite adequate medical treatment (n = 16, 59.3\%); or for negative patients who had significant pulmonary parenchymal lesion (n = 11, 40.7\%) which would have had a high probability of recurrence. Pneumonectomy was done in nine patients, lobectomy in 16 and segmentectomy in two. Results: Then was no operative mortality. Morbidity occurred in seven patients (25.9\%): prolonged air leakage in three patients, reoperation due to bleeding in two, bronchopleural fistula in one, and reversible blindness in one. The median follow up period was 15 months (range 3-45). Sputum negative conversion was achieved in 22 patients (81.5\%) initially. However, continued postoperative chemotherapy could convert to negative in another four patients (14.8\%). Only one pneumonectomy patient (3.7\%) failed because of considerable contralateral cavity. Conclusion: For patients with MDR pulmonary tuberculosis which is localized, and with adequate pulmonary reserve function, surgical pulmonary resection combined with appropriate pre and postoperative anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy can achieve high success rate with acceptable morbidity.

Streptomyces spp. and their metabolites may have great potential as excellent agents for controlling various fungal and bacterial phytopathogens. Streptomycetes belong to the rhizosoil microbial communities and are efficient colonizers of plant tissues, from roots to the aerial parts. They are active producers of antibiotics and volatile organic compounds, both in soil and in planta, and this feature is helpful for identifying active antagonists of plant pathogens and can be used in several cropping systems as biocontrol agents. Additionally, their ability to promote plant growth has been demonstrated in a number of crops, thus inspiring the wide application of streptomycetes as biofertilizers to increase plant productivity.

A total of 96 isolates and 46 isolates from lesions of cellulitis and airsacculitis, respectively, were obtained. Isolates from the backs of some of the affected and healthy birds and 91 intestinal and extraintestinal isolates from humans with diarrhea, urinary tract infections, or septicemia were examined. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance was in general higher in the avian than in the human isolates. VT1-VT2-Eae and VT2-Eae, pathotypes associated with hemolytic and uremic syndrome and bloody diarrhea in humans, were the most frequently encountered pathotypes in human intestinal isolates but were not recovered from the avian isolates. Aero-Pap-TSH and Aero-TSH were the most frequently encountered pathotypes in avian isolates but were rarely observed in human isolates. No avian isolate was of serogroup O157, whereas many human isolates belonged to this O group. O78 and O2 were the most frequently observed O groups in avian isolates but were rarely found in human isolates. Only two avian isolates demonstrated possible relatedness to human isolates based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles, but they belonged to different pathotypes. Our results suggest that avian isolates recovered from cellulitis and air sacullitis possess very few of the attributes required to cause diseases in humans.

Understanding the molecular genetic basis of virulence and physiology of this pathogen will be critical for defining its pathogenic mechanisms. The purine biosynthetic gene, URA5 encoding orate phosphorybosyltransferase (OPRTase), has been successfully used as a selectable marker for gene disruption by transformation and homologous recombination in Cg. Here, we report the characterization of ura5 auxotrophy and URA5 reversion phenomenon at the molecular, genetic, and structural levels, and use of ura5 -> URA5 reversion as a tool for reconstitution of gene of interest and auxotrophic marker to their native loci. We identified a single mutation of GG(128)T -> GAT with substitution of glycine to aspartic acid at amino acid position 43 resulting in ura5 auxotrophy. The ura5 -> URA5 reversion on CSM lacking uracil (CSM-U) was found to be a rare phenomenon with a reversion frequency of 0.000002\%, and sequence analysis of URA5 from all the reverted strains revealed mutation of GA(128)T -> GGT back to its ancestral state. The URA5 allele in the reverted strains was fully functional, as demonstrated by the excellent growth of these strains on medium lacking uracil, as well as by the ability of this allele to efficiently transform ura5 mutant to restore prototrophy. The deduced Cg URA5 protein modeled on the known crystal structures of OPRTase from Salmonella typhimurium (1LH0\_A, 1STO) and from Escherichia coli (1ORO\_A) indicated that the glycine 43 of Cg URA5 was situated on a conserved loop, and it's substitution to more globose aspartic acid may have resulted in URA5 inactivation in auxotrophic strain. The advantages of this approach for the generation of a reconstituted strain are (1) that it restores the functionality of the native URA5, (2) that it eliminates an additional biolistic delivery of exogenous URA5, and (3) that it allows easy selection of reconstituted strains with homologous integration. This strategy was successfully used for the generation of Cg can2+CAN2/URA5 homologous reconstituted strains, which grew in ambient air to the wild-type level while can2 mutant exhibited severe growth defect under similar conditions."

Consistent with mevalonate being a limiting prerequisite for TAFC biosynthesis, we observed increased expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (Hmg1) under iron starvation, reduced TAFC biosynthesis following lovastatin-mediated Hmg1 inhibition, and increased TAFC biosynthesis following Hmg1 overexpression. We identified enzymes, the acyl-CoA ligase SidI and the enoyl-CoA hydratase SidH, linking biosynthesis of mevalonate and TAFC, deficiency of which under iron starvation impaired TAFC biosynthesis, growth, oxidative stress resistance, and murine virulence. Moreover, inactivation of these enzymes alleviated TAFC-derived biosynthetic demand for mevalonate, as evidenced by increased resistance to lovastatin. Concordant with bilateral demand for mevalonate, iron starvation decreased the ergosterol content and composition, a phenotype that is mitigated in TAFC-lacking mutants."

Investigations at hospitals are vital as hospitals accommodate people with compromised immune systems and could acquire other infections if air quality is not monitored. Monitoring of air quality is important as it may assist in identifying and controlling possible microbial threats such as viruses, fungi and drug resistant microbes. In addition, rapid identification of airborne microbes is essential in this environment. Molecular methods are frequently used for rapid identification of microorganisms. However, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry has proved over recent years to be a rapid, accurate, easy-to-use, and inexpensive method for the identification of microorganisms. The aim of this study was to monitor air quality at different wards by quantifying and identifying (using MALDI-TOF MS) airborne microorganisms at a South African hospital. In general, counts for samples collected with the SAS super 90 were below 95 cfu/m3, this was observed for fungi and bacteria. Bacterial counts ranged from 2 to 95 cfu/m3 and fungal counts 5 to 25 cfu/m3. Samples were also collected at all ventilation systems in different wards using swabs, counts were dominated by bacteria, counts ranged from 100 to more than 300 cfu/ml -1. Results from the study indicate that bacteria from vents were not aerolised in significant quantities. However, their presence is of great concern due to the possibility of aerial transmission related with their presence. Fungi and bacteria identified using MALDI-TOF MS included yeast genera Candida, Cryptococcus and Rhodotorula and bacterial genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Arthrobacter, and Micrococcus. Even though counts from the air were low there is a need for frequent indoor air quality monitoring as some of these microorganisms are opportunistic pathogens."

Growth, lung function, Chest CT imaging, and microbiologic characteristics were compared between 4 and 12 months for SHS and non-SHS exposed patients. RESULTS: SHS exposed infants with CF had decreased growth between 4 and 12 months compared to non-SHS exposed infants. SHS exposure was associated with increased bronchodilator responsiveness and air trapping, but no other lung function or radiologic differences. SHS exposure was also associated with increased methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and anaerobic growth on respiratory culture. There was no difference in Pseudomonas aeruginosa between groups. There were no differences in antibiotic use or hospitalizations between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: SHS exposure in CF infants is associated with diminished growth, increased air trapping and bronchodilator responsiveness, and propensity to culture MRSA and facultative anaerobic bacteria, suggesting the need for early, aggressive parental smoking cessation interventions to prevent SHS exposure complications."

Many fungal cell wall components are absent from mammalian systems, so they are potential drug targets. Cell-wall-targeting drugs such as echinocandins are used clinically, although echinocandin-resistant strains were discovered shortly after their introduction. Currently there are no fully effective anti-fungal drugs. Fungal cell wall glycoconjugates modulate human immune responses, as well as fungal cell adhesion, biofilm formation, and drug resistance. Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) mannose transporters (GMTs) transfer GDP-mannose from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen prior to mannosylation. Aspergillus nidulans GMTs are encoded by gmtA and gmtB.

Strains engineered to lack either or both GMTs were assessed for hyphal and colonial morphology, cell wall ultrastructure, antifungal susceptibility, spore hydrophobicity, adherence and biofilm formation. The gmt-deleted strains had smaller colonies with reduced sporulation and with thicker hyphal walls. The gmtA deficient spores had reduced hydrophobicity and were less adherent and less able to form biofilms in vitro. Thus, gmtA not only participates in maintaining the cell wall integrity but also plays an important role in biofilm establishment and adherence of A. nidulans. These findings suggested that GMTs have roles in A. nidulans growth and cell-cell interaction and could be a potential target for new antifungals that target virulence determinants."

Primary human alveolar epithelial cells were immortalized by a novel regimen, grown as monolayers on permeable filter supports and characterized morphologically, biochemically and biophysically. hAELVi cells maintain the capacity to form tight intercellular junctions, with high trans-epithelial electrical resistance (> 1000 Omega(star)cm(2)). The cells could be kept in culture over several days, up to passage 75, under liquid-liquid as well as air-liquid conditions. Ultrastructural analysis and real-time PCR revealed type I-like cell properties, such as the presence of caveolae, expression of caveolin-1, and absence of surfactant protein C. Accounting for the barrier properties, inter-digitations sealed with tight junctions and desmosomes were also observed. Low permeability of the hydrophilic marker sodium fluorescein confirmed the suitability of hAELVi cells for in vitro transport studies across the alveolar epithelium. These results suggest that hAELVi cells reflect the essential features of the air-blood barrier, as needed for an alternative to animal testing to study absorption and toxicity of inhaled drugs, chemicals and nanomaterials."

Recent studies have shown that highly swollen, compliant surfaces resist bacterial attachment and a sufficient density of mobile cationic charge can effectively disrupt bacterial cell membranes. Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs), a popular coating system for surface modification, have been used to kill bacteria through the incorporation of contact-killing or leaching biocides. In this work, we show that manipulation of multilayer assembly and postassembly conditions (e.g., pH) to expose mobile cationic charge can create antimicrobial PEMs without the addition of specific biocidal species. As a model system, we explored PEMs comprising poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (SPS) assembled at high pH and subsequently immersed in low pH solutions. This system undergoes a reversible pH-dependent swelling transition, and we demonstrate that antimicrobial functionality at physiological pH conditions can be turned on and off with suitable pH treatment. In both airborne and waterborne bacteria assays, the viability of two strains of Gram positive Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), one biofilm forming and one nonbiofilm forming, and two strains of Gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) was effectively reduced on SPS/PAH multilayers displaying accessible cationic charge. To generalize our results, the pH assembly conditions of PEMs comprising poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and PAH were also modified to introduce antibacterial capabilities."

The role of biofilm formation in V. cholerae pathogenesis is well established, as it provides the bacterium enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial agents and increased transmission. In the present study, four medicinal plants used in traditional medicines with antidiarrheal properties were evaluated for its antibiofilm activity. Methanol extracts of these plants (Centella asiatica, Elephantopus scaber, Camellia sinensis, and Holarrhena antidysenterica) showed promising antibiofilm activity against V. cholerae with crystal violet and air-liquid interface coverslip assays. Results revealed that C. asiatica, E. scaber, C. sinensis, and H. antidysenterica extracts significantly inhibited biofilm formation by approximately 75, 76, 78, and 55\% at concentrations of 3, 2, 1, and 0.6 mg/mL, respectively. A promising antibiofilm activity of similar to 89\% inhibition at 1.5 mg/mL concentration was observed when a combination of E. scaber and C. sinensis was used. The herbal extracts were thermostable at a temperature range of 40 to 100 degrees C. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay revealed that the viability of bacteria was not affected by treatment with these plant extracts. Gene expression studies revealed that extracts of H. antidysenterica leaf, H. antidysenterica bark, and the whole plant of E. scaber and C. asiatica down-regulate aphA or aphB, the major regulator genes modulating both virulence and biofilm formation. Hence, we propose that these herbal combinations could serve as a multifaceted approach to combat the pathogen and also, in turn, reduce antimicrobial resistance development."

As a first step, pulmonary bacteria were cultured and their headspace analyzed for the total amount of excreted VOCs to select those compounds which are exclusively associated with specific microorganisms. Development of a rapid, noninvasive methodology for identification of bacterial species may improve diagnostics and antibiotic therapy, ultimately leading to controlling the antibiotic resistance problem. Two hundred bacterial headspace samples from four different microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to detect a wide array of VOCs. Statistical analysis of these volatiles enabled the characterization of specific VOC profiles indicative for each microorganism. Differences in VOC abundance between the bacterial types were determined using ANalysis of VAriance-principal component analysis (ANOVA-PCA). These differences were visualized with PCA. Cross validation was applied to validate the results. We identified a large number of different compounds in the various headspaces, thus demonstrating a highly significant difference in VOC occurrence of bacterial cultures compared to the medium and between the cultures themselves. Additionally, a separation between a methicillin-resistant and a methicillin-sensitive isolate of S. aureus could be made due to significant differences between compounds. ANOVA-PCA analysis showed that 25 VOCs were differently profiled across the various microorganisms, whereas a PCA score plot enabled the visualization of these clear differences between the bacterial types. We demonstrated that identification of the studied microorganisms, including an antibiotic susceptible and resistant S. aureus substrain, is possible based on a selected number of compounds measured in the headspace of these cultures. These in vitro results may translate into a breath analysis approach that has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in medical microbiology."

With the exception of four strains tested by E test in CO2, all organisms were susceptible to a proposed telithromycin susceptibility breakpoint of less than or equal to 1 mu g/ml. By disk diffusion with 15-mu g telithromycin disks, all strains but one had zones of inhibition greater than or equal to 19 mm in diameter when incubated in CO2, while all strains had zone diameters of greater than or equal to 22 mm when incubated in air.

There were focuses of typhus, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and meningitis. Insufficiencies in the removal of faeces caused high incidences of shigellosis, hepatitis A, and ascariasis. As a result of insufficient body care, many people were infested with fleas, lice and scabies. The migration of large proportions of the population resulted in an increasing prevalence of syphilis an gonorrhea. As the population resettled, the first steps towards reorganization of public health could be done. The spread of typhoid fever was controlled by drinking-water disinfection with chlorine, repair of sewage systems, and patient isolation. The application of DDT helped to reduce scabies and pediculosis, resulting in decreasing typhus risks. During the first two decades after the war, there was a steady decrease of the incidence of infectious diseases. The reconstruction of the towns resulted in improved housing conditions and a decreasing number of persons per housing area, reducing the intensity of physical contacts of the inhabitants with each other. The nutrition and clothing situation of the population improved, which, in addition to a general rise of the standards of hygiene, brought about an increase of the individual resistance to infection. A further reduction of sporadic and epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases was achieved by the introduction of chemotherapy and antibiotics. Increasing prosperity was accompanied by new problems of hygiene. Infectious diseases almost eradicated in West Germany, were imported by air travellers. Ten imported cases of smallpox were reported between 1957 and 1972, eight of which originated from Southeast Asia. Malaria, imported by German and foreign soldiers, had not been uncommon after the end of the war but had been easy to control by insecticides and antimalarials. As tourism expanded, a new wave of imported malaria cases was reported. In West Germany there is, however, no more spread of the disease under present conditions, cholera caused similar problems. The 1961 cholera epidemic started in Southeast Asia and caused minor outbreaks in Mediterranean countries like Italy and Spain. A significant spread of the disease throughout Europe was prevented by generally high standards of drinking water and sewage treatment. Sporadic cases of typhoid fever were imported from countries with low standards of hygiene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This study aimed to elucidate the penetration of erythromycin through Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm. Methods The penetration ratio of erythromycin through Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms of 1457, 1457-msrA, and wild isolate S68 was detected by biofilm penetration model at different time points according to the standard regression curve. The RNA/DNA ratio and the cell density within the biofilms were observed by confocal laser microscope and transmission electromicroscope, respectively. Results The penetration ratios of erythromycin through the biofilms of 1457, 1457-msrA, and S68 after cultivation for 36 hours were 0.93, 0.55 and 0.4, respectively. The erythromycin penetration ratio through 1457 biofilm (0.58 after 8 hours) was higher than that through the other two (0.499 and 0.31 after 24 hours). Lower growth rate of the cells in biofilm was shown, with reduction of RNA/DNA proportion observed by confocal laser microscope through acridine orange stain. Compared with the control group observed by transmission electrmicroscope, the cell density of biofilm air face was lower than that of agar face, with more cell debris. Conclusions Erythromycin could penetrate to the Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm, but could not kill the cells thoroughly. The lower growth rate of the cells within biofilm could help decreasing the erythromycin susceptibility."

In non-permeabilized cells, only LoVo-sc showed mucin-2 staining whereas labelling was positive in all permeabilized cell lines. As shown by electron microscopy screening and by relative resistance to trypsin detachment, only LoVo-sc cells showed strong mucus secretion. All three cell lines displayed strong staining for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and lung-resistance-related protein (LRP) in different locations according to the drug resistance state. The three cell lines showed intracellular labelling of LRP and MRP. The sensitive cells showed P-gp in a large perinuclear ring and in the cytoplasm, but little (LoVo-sc cells) or no staining (LoVo-f cells) was shown at the plasma membrane level. For the LovoDox cells, P-gp was located in the plasma membrane, in cellular anchorages and in the cytoplasm as well. Cell resistance against antineoplastic agents often results from mobilization of various factors, the modulation of which is linked to the culture conditions. As most of the protocols utilize cells growing in (air+5-10\% CO2) atmosphere e.g. 20\% O-2, balance of the respective participants in the MDR multi-modal mechanism may not be representative of the in vivo situation and may lead to erratic pharmacological response. Indeed, cells within solid tumours were exposed to low pO(2), most of them being under hypoxic condition (0.1-5\% O-2). In the absence of anticancer drugs, all LoVo cell lines grew notably faster at 20\% O-2 than at 5\% O-2. Moreover, respective sensitivities of both non-MDR variants to doxorubicin were altered according the pO(2). Whatever the pO(2) was, virtually none of the antioxidants tested affected the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin for the three cell lines. By contrast, trolox showed a strong inhibitory effect on doxorubicin activity.

Currently, selection pressure caused by azole fungicide use in farming is strongly suspected of creating resistance. As sawmills also use azole fungicides, we investigated the presence of azole-resistant strains in this environment and studied the relationship between azole fungicide use and development of resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Air (n = 200) and substrate (n = 600) samples were taken in 20 sawmills. Azole-resistant strains (Etest and EUCAST methods) were confirmed by sequencing the cyp51A gene and its promoters. Dosage of propiconazole and tebuconazole was performed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Twenty-four azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains were collected among 20 of the 600 substrate samples (3%). Eighty-three percent of theses strains had TR34 /L98H mutation. A significantly higher number of resistant strains was collected in sawmills using fungicide products made with propiconazole mixed with a high concentration of tebuconazole (P = 0.009). The presence of resistant strains was significantly linked to propiconazole quantities in substrates (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of azole-resistant A. fumigatus carrying TR34 /L98H mutation seems to greatly depend on the azole fungicide formulation and quantities of azole. These preliminary results are valuable to propose new approaches limiting the emergence of azole-resistant strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Azole resistance is an emerging problem in A. fumigatus and threatens clinical advances made possible by the use of azole antifungals in the treatment of Aspergillus-related diseases. Azole fungicides are also used in the wood industry, notably in sawmills, to protect wood from wood-destroying fungi.

The respiratory care equipments which include ventilators, humidifiers, nebulizers may have been identified as the potential vehicles which cause major nosocomial infections if they are colonized by fungi or bacteria. Aim: To determine the rate of colonization by bacteria and fungi of the oxygen humidifier chambers of the portable cylinders and central lines at our hospital. The Hudson's chambers of nebulizers were also studied for the same. Methods: Swab samples were obtained from the equipments by using sterile cotton swabs on a tuesday, as these chambers were usually cleaned on every Saturday. Spot samples were taken from the ICUs, wards, the casualty and OPDs on a single day. Air samples were also obtained on the same day to determine whether the fungal spore load in the inhaled room air was normal or high. We performed a disinfection with 70% ethanol after cleaning these devices. Results: 53/70 (75.71%) samples showed fungal growth; out of which, 23/33 (69.70%) were from the ICU, 24/30(80%) were from the wards and 6/7 (85.71%) were from the OPDs. 23/30 (76.66%) swabs from the central line humidifiers, 18/23(78.26%) swabs from the O2 cylinder humidifiers and 8/17 (47.5%) swabs from the nebulizers grew bacteria. Of the total 61(87.14%) bacterial isolates, 42(68.85%) were gram negative bacteria and 19(31.14%) were gram positive cocci.

Our findings (before disinfection) showed that the colonization rate for fungi was 75% and that for bacteria, it was 87%. After the 70% ethanol disinfection and strict compliance with the hand hygiene, the colonization rates reduced significantly. The fungal colonization rate was reduced and only 15% fungi grew after the disinfection, while only 12% bacterial colonization rate was found.

We describe a novel device that utilizes immunosensor and bio-optical technology to detect M. tuberculosis antigen (Ag85B) in cough and demonstrate its use under field conditions during a pilot study in an area of high TB incidence. Methods: The TB Breathalyzer device (Rapid Biosensor Systems Ltd) was field tested in the outpatient clinic of Adama Hospital, Ethiopia. Adults seeking diagnosis for respiratory complaints were tested. Following nebulization with 0.9\% saline patients were asked to cough into a disposable collection device where cough aerosols were deposited. Devices were then inserted into a portable instrument to assess whether antigen was present in the sample. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and all patients were subjected to chest radiogram and examination of sputum by Ziehl-Nielsen microscopy. In the absence of culture treatment decisions were based on smear microscopy, chest x-ray and clinical assessment. Breathalyzer testing was undertaken by a separate physician to triage and diagnostic assessment. Results: Sixty individuals were each subjected to a breathalyzer test. The procedure was well tolerated and for each patient the testing was completed in less than 10 min. Positive breath test results were recorded for 29 (48\%) patients. Of 31 patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis 23 (74\%; 95\% CI 55-87) were found positive for antigen in their breath and 20 (64\%; 95\% CI 45-80) were smear positive for acid fast bacilli in their sputum. Six patients provided apparent false positive breathalyzer results that did not correlate with a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Conclusions: We propose that the breathalyzer device described warrants further investigation as a tool for studying exhalation of M. tuberculosis. The portability, simplicity of use and speed of the test device suggest it may also find use as a tool to aid early identification of infectious cases. We recommend studies be undertaken to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the device when compared to microbiological and clinical indicators of tuberculosis disease."

The complex relationships among virulence determinants have hitherto not been fully elucidated. In the present study, 175 catheter-related isolates were observed for the presence of selected virulence factors, namely extracellular enzymes and siderophore production, biofilm formation, resistance to antibiotics, and motility. A high percentage of the strains produced most of the tested virulence factors. A positive correlation was identified between the production of several exoproducts, and also between the formation of both types of biofilm. An opposite trend was observed between the two types of biofilm and the production of siderophores. Whereas the relationship between the submerged biofilm production (i.e. the biofilm formed on the solid surface below the water level) and the siderophore secretion was negative, the production of air-liquid interface (A-L) biofilm (i.e. the biofilm floating on the surface of the cultivation medium) and the siderophore secretion were positively correlated. All correlations were statistically significant at the level P=0.05 with the correlation coefficient 0.50. Our results suggest that: (1) the co-production of the lytic enzymes and siderophores can play an important role in the pathogenesis of the catheter-related infections and should be taken into account when the virulence potential is assessed; (2) biofilm-positive strains are capable of forming both submerged and non-attached A-L biofilms; and (3) the different micro-environment in the submerged biofilm and A-L biofilm layers have opposite consequences for the production of other virulence factors."

Diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis is made by MR investigation. but despite the use of appropriate sequences for study of the temporal region, around 40\% of MR scans are negative for this disease. The ``quantitative MR{''} technique was introduced to enhance to sensitivity of MR by relaxometry and computerised volumetry techniques. We examined 14 healthy subjects and 32 patients with temporal epilepsy assessing seizure type, age at onset of epilepsy; duration, history of febrile convulsions, seizure frequency. drug resistance, secondary generalisation and EEG patterns. MR investigation was performed using a high field system (1.5 T) for target assessment of the temporal regional as well as sequences for relaxometry and volumetry of the hippocampus For relaxometry studies Ive performed monoslice multiecho T2-weighted sequences mapping hippocampal T2 relaxation times measured in milliseconds with coronal sections perpendicular to the largest axis of the hippocampus. Images for volumetric assessment of the hippocampus Ir ere obtained from T1 3D FFE coronal sequences 3 mm thick. The hippocampal surface was drawn manually and the total volume calculated by multiplying the surfaces obtained by the number and thickness of the sections in which the hippocampus was present. Statistical analysis of tire results was done using Pearson's correlation coefficient, Student's t test and the C2 test. Results showed that both hippocampuses were reduced in volume in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy compared with the control group, whereas relaxometric analysis showed a significant change in T2 relaxation times of the hippocampus in temporal epilepsy patients only if the findings correlated with the EEG focus. Volumetric measurements allow accurate assessment of the size of the hippocampus, but tile firming of volumetric reduction of a hippocampus is based on comparison with tile controlateral hippocampus: volumetry alone is insufficient in assessing bilateral hippocampus sclerosis. Study of T2 relaxation times has the advantage of supplying absolute numerical values expressed in milliseconds which be compared with normal or pathological values described in die literature. In addition, this measurement does not require corrections or interpretation which could make investigation less objective. Instead, the disadvantage of this technique is that increased T2 relaxation time is air aspecific index, not necessarily linked to hippocampus sclerosis. Another limitation is that this measurement is made on a single 5mm thick sequence so that hippocampus signal changes not included in the section may be missed. As quantitative MR requires considerable technical and human resources and significantly longer MR examination times, this method should riot be applied in all patients with suspect hippocampus sclerosis, but confirmed to cases with negative qualitative e MR, those with suspect bilateral involvement of hippocampus structures and surgical candidates"

This observation led us to consider the possibility that mercury released from amalgam (''silver'') dental restorations might be a selective agent for both mercury- and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the oral and intestinal floras of primates. Resistances to mercury and to several antibiotics were examined in the oral and intestinal floras of six adult monkeys prior to the installation of amalgam fillings, during the time they were in place, and after replacement of the amalgam fillings with glass ionomer fillings (in four of the monkeys). The monkeys were fed an antibiotic-free diet, and fecal mercury concentrations were monitored. There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of mercury-resistant bacteria during the 5 weeks following installation of the amalgam fillings and during the 5 weeks immediately following their replacement with glass ionomer fillings. These peaks in incidence of mercury-resistant bacteria correlated with peaks of Hg elimination (as high as 1 mM in the feces) immediately following amalgam placement and immediately after replacement of the amalgam fillings. Representative mercury-resistant isolates of three selected bacterial families (oral streptococci, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and enterococci) were also resistant to one or more antibiotics, including ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol. While such mercury- and antibiotic-resistant isolates among the staphylococci, the enterococci, and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae have been described, this is the first report of mercury resistance in the oral streptococci. Many of the enterobacterial strains were able to transfer mercury and antibiotic resistances together to laboratory bacterial recipients, suggesting that the loci for these resistances are genetically linked. Our findings indicate that mercury released from amalgam fillings can cause An enrichment of mercury resistance plasmids in the normal bacterial floras of primates. Many of these plasmids also carry antibiotic resistance, implicating the exposure to mercury from dental amalgams in an increased incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance plasmids in the normal floras of nonmedicated subjects."

With respect to the latter, the significance of functional P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity in Calu-3 cells has recently been questioned, despite previous reports demonstrating a significant contribution by the same transporter in limiting drug uptake across the pulmonary epithelium. Therefore, the aim of this study was the standardization of this model as a tool for drug discovery. Methods: Calu-3 cells were grown using air-interfaced condition (AIC) on polyester cell culture supports. Monolayers were evaluated for transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), permeability to the paracellular marker fluorescein sodium (flu-Na), surface P-gp expression, and functionality. Mucous secretion was also identified by alcian blue staining. Results: TEER and permeability values obtained for Calu-3 monolayers were shown to plateau between day 5 and day 21 in culture with values reaching 474 +/- 44 Omega cm(2) and 2.33 +/- 0.36 x 10(-7) cm/s, respectively, irrespective of the passage number examined. 32.7 +/- 1.49\% of Calu-3 cells cultured under these conditions detected positive for cell surface P-gp expression from day 7 onwards.

Bacterial biofilms are three-dimensional aggregates of bacteria that often are recalcitrant to antibiotics secondary to physical barrier characteristics. To date, all studies investigating biofilms in CRS have been descriptive in either human or animal tissue. To better understand the interactions of bacterial biofilms with respiratory epithelium, we describe an in vitro model of biofilm sinusitis by establishing mature biofilms on airway epithelial air-liquid interface cultures. METHODS: Airway epithelial cell cultures were grown on collagen-coated semipermeable support membranes as an air-liquid interface on tissue culture inserts. Confluent air-liquid interface cultures were inoculated with the biofilm-forming PAO-1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and compared with cultures inoculated with two mutant strains (sad-31 and sad-36) unable to form biofilms. Inoculated tissue transwells were incubated for 20 hours, allowing for biofilm growth. The semipermeable membranes were then harvested and imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Microscopic analysis revealed the formation of biofilm-forming towers in the PAO-1 inoculated wells. The bacterial biofilms were supported by a viable airway epithelial cell surface monolayer. CONCLUSION: This study shows a reliable method for analysis of in vitro interactions of bacterial biofilms and airway epithelium. The experimental manipulation of this air-liquid interface model will help explore novel treatment approaches for bacterial biofilm-associated CRS."

Samples from outside (including ground surfaces, ambient air, slurry and digestate from biogas plants) and, in parallel, from inside the pig barns (including pig feces, dust, barn air, flies and mice feces) were examined for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli and selected isolates were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. 14/17 (82.4%) slurry samples and three of four samples of digestate from biogas plants tested positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. In the vicinity of the pig barns these resistant bacteria were detected in 14/87 (16.1%) boot swabs taken from various ground surfaces and in 2/36 (6%) ambient air samples. Inside the pig barns, 6/63 (9.5%) barn air samples and a small proportion of flies and mice feces samples were ESBL/AmpC-positive. PFGE analysis proved fecal emission as well as a possible spread via flies, as identical ESBL-E. coli isolates were detected in slurry and on fertilized fields, as well as in flies and pooled feces from inside the barn and slurry. Contaminated slurry presented the major emission source for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in the pig fattening farms, but a spread via the airborne route or via different vectors also seems possible."

Spread of S. aureus in hospitals and infection control measures are reviewed. The major sources of S. aureus in hospitals are septic lesions and carriage sites of patients and personnel. Carriage often precedes infection. The anterior nares are the most consistent carriage site, followed by the perineal area. Skin contamination and aerial dissemination vary markedly between carriers and are most pronounced for combined nasal and perineal carriers. The principal mode of transmission is via transiently contaminated hands of hospital personnel. Airborne transmission seems important in the acquisition of nasal carriage. Infection control strategies include screening and isolation of newly admitted patients suspected of carrying MRSA or S. aureus with intermediate resistance to vancomycin, implementation of an infection control program to prevent transmission of resistant strains between patients and hospital personnel, and institution of a proper antibiotic policy to minimize antibiotic resistance development. MRSA carriers should be treated with intranasal antibiotics, e.g. mupirocin, and skin disinfectants to eliminate carriage. Education of hospital personnel is essential. Improved knowledge about the best ways to ensure favourable infection control practices is needed. Active intervention against the spread of MRSA is important."

Public health physicians on 24-hour duty declare a quarantine alert and the case is transferred to one of five isolation centers not by plane but by ambulance car. The isolation rooms in Berlin, constructed some 20 years ago, are enclosed with plastic film and kept under negative pressure and this hinders it difficult to perform intensive care in the small space available. In contrast, intensive care and routine clinical tests can be readily conducted in the isolation facilities in Leipzig installed in 2000, since the rooms are spacious and kept under negative pressure. It is also noteworthy that the same ward is utilized for patients with drug-resistant infectious diseases to train medical staff. With 3 of the 4 goals in the WHO program, establishing efficient surveillance of infectious diseases, provision of a qualified national laboratory and performance on practical research on infectious diseases, there are no large differences, between the two countries, in continuous efforts in line with recently-modified infectious disease laws. However, we found differences with regard to an effective strategy to circumvent VHF, 1) local government has a main role against VHF and control team is promptly designated in Germany, 2) only 10 beds are equipped to deal with VHF in Germany, 3) management of air-droplet infection seems insufficient in Japan, 4) highly-equipped isolation rooms are not utilized for patients other than those with VHF in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: These findings require urgent discussion among Japanese experts concerning; 1) operation of BSL4 facilities in national laboratories; 2) collaboration among quarantine stations, local government and national reference laboratories; 3) the appropriate number of isolation wards; 4) practical procedures to run of isolation wards efficiently; 5) the possibility of utilizing isolation wards for non-VHF."

Since 1990 several clusters of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have been identified among hospitalized patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We investigated one such cluster in a voluntary hospital in New York. Methods. We compared exposures among 18 patients with AIDS in whom tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and streptomycin was diagnosed from January 1989 through April 1990 (the case patients) with exposures among 30 control patients who had AIDS and tuberculosis susceptible to isoniazid, streptomycin, or both. We also compared exposures among the 14 case patients hospitalized during the six months before the diagnosis of tuberculosis (the exposure period) with those among 44 control patients with AIDS matched for duration of hospitalization. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were typed with analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP). Results. Case patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis were significantly more likely than controls with drug-susceptible tuberculosis to have been hospitalized during their exposure periods (14 of 18 vs. 10 of 30) (odds ratio, 7.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 36; P = 0.006). Case patients hospitalized during their exposure periods were significantly more likely to have been hospitalized on the same ward as a patient with infectious drug-resistant tuberculosis than were either controls with drug-susceptible tuberculosis hospitalized during their exposure periods or controls matched for duration of hospitalization (13 of 14 vs. 2 of 10 and 23 of 44) (odds ratio, 52; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 2474; P < 0.001; and odds ratio, infinity; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to infinity; P = 0.005, respectively). Among those hospitalized on the same ward, the rooms of case patients were closer to that of the nearest patient with infectious tuberculosis than were the rooms of controls matched for duration of hospitalization. M. tuberculosis isolates from 15 of 16 case patients had identical patterns on RFLP analysis. Of 16 patients' rooms tested with air-flow studies, only 1 had the recommended negative-pressure ventilation. Conclusions. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is readily transmitted among hospitalized patients with AIDS. Physicians must be alert to this danger and must enforce adherence to the measures recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis."

Here, we developed an ALI organoid model from normal and tumor colorectal tissues of human patients. Both organoids were successfully generated and showed cystic structures containing an epithelial layer and surrounding mesenchymal stromal cells. Structures of tumor organoids closely resembled primary tumor epithelium. Expression of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, a goblet cell marker, MUC2, and a fibroblast marker, vimentin, but not a myofibroblast marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), was observed in normal organoids. Expression of E-cadherin, MUC2, vimentin, and alpha-SMA was observed in tumor organoids. Expression of a cancer stem cell marker, LGR5 in tumor organoids, was higher than that in primary tumor tissues. Tumor organoids were more resistant to toxicity of 5-fluorouracil and Irinotecan than colorectal cancer cell lines, SW480, SW620, and HCT116.

Twitching motility contributes to the virulence of P. aeruginosa and permits colonization and infection of the respiratory tract. Genetic relatedness and cross-infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa could be identified by the random amplified polymorphic (RAPD) - PCR genotypic identification system. Methods and Findings: RAPD typing of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from 1) pulmonary tract CF patients, 2) lung cancer patients before and other cases after thoracic radiotherapy (TRT), and 3) environmental specimens; from endotracheal tubing and from a ventilator in ICU also, antimicrobial susceptibility (by disc diffusion agar method) and twitching motility assay (subsurface by stab-inoculation &amp; at agar-air interface) were carried out. Phylogenic analysis of the RAPD pattern showed rates of genetic similarity ranging from 11-100%. The tested isolates exhibited diverse patterns with little clonality. A high antimicrobial susceptibility rate was detected to amikacin, meropenem &amp; imipenem (90.59, 87.06 &amp; 85.88%) respectively and low susceptibility rate to azithromycin (12.94%). An association was observed between genotype and antibiotype. A detailed examination of twitching motility under optimal conditions in vitro was carried out. Overall rate of radial colony expansion was 0.12 &amp; 0.80 mm h-1 for lowest and highest twitching motility respectively. The zones of colony expansion due to twitching motility exhibit concentric rings in which there is a high density of microcolonies was observed, which may reflect periods of expansion and consolidation/cell division. Conclusions: The observations demonstrate twitching motility as a rapid, highly organized mechanism of bacterial translocation by which P. aeruginosa can disperse itself over large areas to colonize new surfaces. Highly significant correlation between antibiotic resistance and twitching motility was detected. The results may be useful in preventing pulmonary cross infection and in outbreak analysis.

Techniques such as the use of tamps that produce ultraviolet germicidal radiation may reduce exposure to infectious agents by inactivating or killing microorganisms while they are airborne. We designed and evaluated a test method to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of germicidal lamps, in conjunction with dilution ventilation, for reducing the concentration of viable airborne bacteria, Bacterial particles were generated in a 36 m(3) room and collected with midget impingers at 5-7 locations. The effectiveness of the control technique was determined by comparing concentrations of culturable airborne bacteria with and without the control in operation, Results for a single, 15 W germicidal lamp showed reductions of 50\% for Bacillus subtilis (B, subtilis) and Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus); tests with Escherichia coli (E. coli) showed nearly 100\% reduction (E, coli were isolated only from the sampler nearest the aerosol source when the lamp was operating). The addition of louvers to a lamp greatly reduced its efficacy. Decay experiments showed that roughly 4-6 equivalent air changes per hour were achieved for B, subtilis with one or two lamps operating. These preliminary experiments demonstrated that this methodology was well suited for these evaluations and identified factors that could be modified to refine the study design for future work."

In this paper, a hybrid triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is designed to simultaneously harvest the electrostatic and mechanical energies of flowing water. Water-TENG, mainly constructed by a superhydrophobic TiO2 layer with hierarchical micro/nanostructures, is used to collect the electrostatic energy of water (Output 1). Contact-TENG, composed by a polytetrafluoroethylene film and a layer of assembled SiO2 nanoparticles, is used to collect the mechanical energy of water (Output 1 and Output 2). Using TiO2 nanomaterials in water-TENG provides the advantages of photocatalytic activity and antibacterial property for water purification. Under the impact of a water stream from a household faucet at a flowing rate of 40 mL s(-1), the generated short-circuit current from Output 1 and Output 2 of dual-mode TENG can reach 43 and 18 muA, respectively. The instantaneous output power densities from Output 1 and Output 2 of dual-mode TENG are 1.31 and 0.38 W m(-2), respectively, when connecting to a load resistor of 44 MOmega. The rectified outputs have been applied to drive light-emitting diodes and charge commercial capacitors. Besides, the water-TENG has also been demonstrated as a self-powered nanosensor for ethanol detection."

The current research has been focused on screening and evaluating various lipids/surfactants possessing inherent anti-mycobacterium activity that can ferry the anti-tubercular drugs. In vitro anti-mycobacterium activity was evaluated using agar well diffusion method. Furthermore, time-concentration dependent killing and DNA/RNA content release studies were performed to correlate the findings. The exact mechanism of bacterial killing was further elucidated by electron/atomic force microscopy studies. Finally, to negate any toxicity, in vitro hemolysis and toxicity studies were performed. The study revealed that capmul MCM C-8, labrasol and acconon C-80 possessed highest in vitro anti-mycobacterium activity. Electron/atomic force microscopy results confirmed in vitro studies and verified the killing of Mycobacterium owing to the release of cytoplasmic content after cell wall fragmentation and disruption. Moreover, the least hemolysis and hundred percent survivals rate of mice using the excipients demonstrated the safety aspects of explored excipients that can ferry the anti-tubercular drugs.

Although there are no true animal reservoirs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, many different animal species are susceptible to infection with this organism and have served as valuable tools for the study of tuberculosis (TB). The most commonly used experimental animal models of TB are the mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig. Although substantial differences in TB susceptibility and disease manifestations exist between these species, they have contributed significantly to the understanding of TB immunopathogenesis, host genetic influence on infection, efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, and host/pathogen interactions that determine the outcome or severity of infection. Among the three species, mice are relatively resistant to TB infection, followed by rabbits and then guinea pigs, which are extremely vulnerable to infection. Mice are most often used in experiments on immune responses to TB infection and drug regimens against TB. Rabbits, unlike the other two animal models, develop cavitary TB and offer a means to study the factors leading to this form of the disease. Guinea pigs, due to their high susceptibility to infection, have been ideal for studies on airborne transmission and vaccine efficacy. In addition to these three species, TB research has occasionally involved nonhuman primates and cattle models. Current concepts in TB pathogenesis have also been derived from animal studies involving experimentally induced infections with related mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium bovis) whose manifestations in select animal hosts mimic human TB."

De novo purine biosynthesis is a promising yet unexploited target, insofar as abundant evidence has shown that bacteria with compromised purine biosynthesis are attenuated. Fundamental differences exist within the process by which humans and bacteria convert 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to 4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR). In bacteria, this transformation occurs through a two-step conversion catalyzed by PurK and PurE; in humans, it is mediated by a one-step conversion catalyzed by class II PurE. Thus, these bacterial enzymes are potential targets for selective antibiotic development. Here, the first comprehensive structural and biochemical characterization of PurK and PurE from S. aureus is presented. Structural analysis of S. aureus PurK reveals a nonconserved phenylalanine near the AIR-binding site that occupies the putative position of the imidazole ring of AIR. Mutation of this phenylalanine to isoleucine or tryptophan reduced the enzyme efficiency by around tenfold. The K(m) for bicarbonate was determined for the first time for a PurK enzyme and was found to be approximately 18.8 mM. The structure of PurE is described in comparison to that of human class II PurE. It is confirmed biochemically that His38 is essential for function.

However, under an atmosphere of air the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum clones released pre-accumulated {[}H-3]chloroquine more rapidly than sensitive clones. The very fast efflux of the preaccumulated drag from chloroquine-resistant (CQR) parasites resulted in a differential in the drug retained by resistant and sensitive parasites. The chloroquine-sensitive parasites retained 2-3 times more chloroquine than resistant parasites. The steady-state uptake of {[}H-3]chloroquine appeared to be enhanced by verapamil and desipramine in the chloroquine-resistant clones, while the opposite was observed with sensitive clones.

To circumvent this emerging problem, we have developed a green strategy of using multivalent, biodegradable polymers such as chitosan, and dendrimers for the facile preparation of conjugated nanoformulations (NMG \& DMG) of methylglyoxal as an antimicrobial agent against resistant bacteria. Interestingly, nanoformulated methylglyoxal selectively interferes with the bacterial pathogens while remaining biocompatible to the mammalian cells as reflected in therapeutic index. The functional group, cationic charge and nanosize of methylglyoxal allows them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers of bacteria and could be the defining mechanisms of antimicrobial activity. This scalable approach of the fabrication of biocompatible nanoformulated methylglyoxal with desired selectivity can revolutionize the treatment of bacterial infection, minimizing human health and environment risks."

The in vitro hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB), in tandem with Monte Carlo experiments, was introduced more than a decade ago. Since then, it has been used to perform a large number of tuberculosis pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studies that have not been subjected to systematic analysis. Methods. We performed a literature search to identify all HFS-TB experiments published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012. There was no exclusion of articles by language. Bias minimization was according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Steps for reporting systematic reviews were followed. Results. There were 22 HFS-TB studies published, of which 12 were combination therapy studies and 10 were monotherapy studies. There were 4 stand-alone Monte Carlo experiments that utilized quantitative output from the HFS-TB. All experiments reported drug pharmacokinetics, which recapitulated those encountered in humans. HFS-TB studies included log-phase growth studies under ambient air, semidormant bacteria at pH 5.8, and nonreplicating persisters at low oxygen tension of <= 10 parts per billion. The studies identified antibiotic exposures associated with optimal kill of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and suppression of acquired drug resistance (ADR) and informed predictions about optimal clinical doses, expected performance of standard doses and regimens in patients, and expected rates of ADR, as well as a proposal of new susceptibility breakpoints. Conclusions. The HFS-TB model offers the ability to perform PK/PD studies including humanlike drug exposures, to identify bactericidal and sterilizing effect rates, and to identify exposures associated with suppression of drug resistance. Because of the ability to perform repetitive sampling from the same unit over time, the HFS-TB vastly improves statistical power and facilitates the execution of time-to-event analyses and repeated event analyses, as well as dynamic system pharmacology mathematical models."

Methods: A daily surveillance of fungal contamination was implemented during 11-months. Environmental survey was realized by air samplings, outdoor and indoor, with an automatic agar sampler. In parallel, surveillance of IA infection cases was conducted by epidemiological investigation. Environmental and clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were identified by conventional methods and -tubulin sequencing. Susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus isolates against Itraconazole (ITZ), Voriconazole (VCZ) was performed using Etest method. Results: A total of 3885 air samples (1744 outdoor samples and 2141 indoor samples) were collected. From the 3073 identified colonies of A. fumigatus, 400 A. fumigatus isolates were tested for their susceptibility to ITZ and VCZ, including 388 isolates coming from the environment (indoor n:157, outdoor n:231) and 12 isolates coming from clinical samples. All the 400 isolates were susceptible to azoles ( 1 g/mL). Conclusions: No environmental reservoir of A. fumigatus azole resistant strains was found in our hospital which was undergoing major demolition works.

In samples from 67 living rooms, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. epidermidis, and S. capitis were found in 13-25\%; S. saprophyticus, S. cohnii, and S. pasteuri in 5-10\%; and S. lugdunensis, S. haemolyticus, S. caprae, S. equorum, S. kloosii, S. pettenkoferi, S. simulans, and S. xylosus in less than 3\%. Staphylococcus aureus were found in two of 67 living rooms: spa type t034 (an MRSA) was recovered from a farmhouse, while spa type t509 was found in an urban home. Two species, S. equorum and S. kloosii, were found only in the farmhouse. Staphylococcus was significantly associated with season with lowest concentration and richness in winter. Genera composition was associated with ACR with smaller fractions of Staphylococcus at higher ACR, while richness was significantly and negatively associated with area per occupant. Concentration of Staphylococcus correlated positively with the total concentration of bacteria, but negatively with the total concentration of other bacteria. The concentration of Staphylococcus was not significantly associated with concentrations of the other abundant genera Bacillus, Kocuria, and Micrococcus. In offices with S. aureus-positive occupants, airborne S. aureus was not found. In conclusion, Staphylococcus species constitute a considerable proportion of the airborne bacteria in the studied homes and offices. However, both S. aureus and MRSA had very low prevalence during all seasons. Thus, transmission of S. aureus and MRSA through the air in living rooms in Copenhagen is expected to be limited. The negative associations between ACR and the fraction Staphylococcus constituted out of total bacteria, and between area per occupant and Staphylococcus richness indicate that it might be possible to affect the presence of airborne Staphylococcus in homes."

Data is lacking on utilization of paediatric isolation facilities in low-resource, TB-endemic settings. Methods: Prospective weekday observation of 18 paediatric isolation rooms at Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, was conducted between 1 May 2014 and 31 October 2014 documenting: occupancy rate; indication for isolation; duration of isolation; application of transmission-based precautions and infection prevention (IPC) behaviour of personnel. Potential under-utilization of isolation rooms was determined by cross-referencing isolation room occupancy with laboratory isolates of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, M. tuberculosis and selected viral pathogens. Results: Six percent (335/5906) of hospitalized children were isolated: 78 \% (260/335) for IPC purposes. Most IPC-isolated patients had community-acquired infections (213/260; 82 \%), including tuberculosis (130/260; 50 \%) and suspected viral infections (75/260; 29 \%). Children (median age 17 months {[}IQR 6-50]) spent 4 days (IQR 2-8) in isolation. Isolation occupancy was 66 \% (2172/3294 occupied bed days), but varied significantly by month. Laboratory data identified an additional 135 patients warranting isolation with 2054 extra bed-days required. Forty patients with 171 patient days of inappropriate isolation were identified. During 1223 weekday visits to IPC-isolated patient rooms: alcohol-based handrub was available (89 \%); transmission-based precautions were appropriately implemented (71 \%); and personal protective equipment was provided (74 \%). Of 358 observed interactions between paediatric staff and isolated patients, hand hygiene compliance was 65 \% and adherence to transmission-based precautions was 58 \%. Conclusion: Patients isolated for TB (under airborne precautions) accounted for more than half of all isolation episodes. Missed opportunities for patient isolation were common but could be reduced by implementation of syndromic isolation. Demand for isolation facilities was seasonal, with projected demand exceeding available isolation beds over winter months."

Sputum samples (n=213) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for culture from cases clinically diagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia are studied. Optochin variability in ambient air and 5\% CO2 was the criterion used to identify S. pseudopneumoniae. Disc-diffusion and E-test on Muller Hinton blood-based agar were used for antibiotic susceptibility testing following Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute breakpoints. Out of the screened isolates, only six (3\%) were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae. None of the commercial tests differentiated the pathogens from viridans streptococci so diagnostic laboratories need to provide an alternative identification algorithm. The six isolates showed susceptibility to penicillin, and five isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, but one exhibited low-level resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration {[}MIC]: 1 mu g/mL). All isolates showed high-level resistance to macrolides (MIC: 24- > 256 mu g/mL). Although S. pseudopneumoniae strains were not sufficiently frequent to justify routine additional incubation of sputum samples in ambient air, the high resistance pattern is alarming. Further surveillance is needed in diagnostic laboratories to understand the epidemiology and clinical significance of the newly described pathogen."

The TfR is overexpressed on the cerebral endothelium and mediates the transcytosis mechanism. Fab' fragments, known for their reduced interaction with the reticuloendothelial system, were also conjugated to LNC. This coupling was facilitated by the incorporation of lipid PEG(2000) functionalized. with reactive-sulfbydryl maleimide groups (DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide) into LNC shells by a post-insertion procedure, developed initially for liposome pegylation. An interfacial model using the dynamic rising drop technique helped determine the parameters influencing the DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide insertion and the quality of the anchorage. Heat was essential to promote both an important and stable adsorption of DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide onto LNC. OX26 MAb were thiolated to react with maleimide functions whereas thiol residues on Fab' fragments were used directly. The number of ligands per nanocapsule was adjusted according to their initial quantity in the coupling reaction mixture, with densities from 16 tol83 whole antibodies and between 42 and 173 Fab' fragments per LNC.

However, parents or adult visitors with unrecognized pulmonary TB may be a threat to hospital staff and other patients. We prospectively evaluated adults accompanying children hospitalized for suspected TB at a children's hospital to determine the frequency of undiagnosed, potentially contagious disease. METHODS: From 1992 to 1998, chest radiographs were obtained from adult caretakers accompanying 59 consecutive children admitted to Texas Children's Hospital with suspected TB. A child and his or her family were placed under Airborne Precautions only if the child or the accompanying adult exhibited characteristics of potentially contagious disease. Annual rates of tuberculin skin test conversion in hospital employees were obtained for the same period. RESULTS: Of the 105 screened adults, 16 (15916) had previously undetected pulmonary TB. These adults were associated with 14 (24\%) of the 59 children. In all instances in which the adult was the patients parent, he or she was the source of infection to the child. Only 8 (13.5\%.) of the 59 children required isolation. Tuberculin skin test conversion from a negative to a positive reaction occurred in 127 employees (8 per 1,000 employee-years at risk). Only 4 of these 127 employees performed activities involving direct patient contact. None was in contact with families with a known potentially contagious adult or pediatric patient. CONCLUSIONS:The risk of infection of healthcare workers from pediatric patients with primary TB appeared to be minimal, and most children with TB did not need isolation. Infection control efforts should be focused on accompanying adults and adult visitors."

It is based on an organoid culture method which allows human carcinomas to grow in vitro and to maintain many typical in vivo properties, including 3-dimensional architecture, growth of multiple cell types, expression of morphological differentiation and formation of histotypical structures. The preservation of drug sensitivity and resistance under the conditions of our organoid culture assay (OCA) was demonstrated by investigating 3 strains of a human hypopharynx carcinoma which differed by different sensitivity to cisplatin in in vivo conditions. These differences were retained in vitro and the modified neutral-red (NR) assay was especially suitable for revealing drug-induced cytotoxic damage in OCA. On the basis of our findings, the following approach is proposed for the in vitro testing of cytostatic drugs before they are administered to patients. (1) Removal of carcinomas from patients; (2) dense cell suspensions of these carcinomas to be dropped on membrane filters at the air-medium interface, resulting in growth of solid nodules of organized carcinoma tissues; (3) addition of cytostatic drugs to the growth medium for 2 or 3 days; (4) detachment and bisection of the culture nodules; (5) determination of viable cells by NR uptake and total cell mass by the sulforhodamin B (SRB) assay; (6) determination of quotient NR:SRB absorbance, related as percentage to control value: this indicates the fraction of viable cells and gives a measure of the cytotoxic injury caused by the applied cytotoxic drug. Thus, the OCA seems to be suitable for defining the patterns of drug sensitivity and resistance of individual human carcinomas in vitro within a few days."

With the appearance of multidrug-resistant TB and emerging infectious disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza viruses, engineering controls using 254 nm UV-C lamps within specialized luminaires, herein designated UVGI fixtures, are being installed in high-risk settings such as homeless shelters, hospitals, jails and prisons, and schools. Studies have established that a relatively uniform spatial distribution of UV-C in the upper room can effectively cleanse the air of aerosolized pathogens. However; for planning purposes, the placement of multiple UVGI fixtures in a space, to achieve uniformity of UV-C energy distribution using currently available lighting software, is not yet practical because no industry-wide standard method exists for radiometric measurement of commercial UVGI fixtures. In this article, standard methods for photometry and reporting of general fluorescent lighting luminaire photometric data are adopted to provide UVGI fixture spatial emission distribution data in an electronic file format. The ultimate expectation of the authors is that the results will lead to a software program for fixture placement, comparable to and as easy to use as the corresponding software used for general interior lighting applications. To accomplish this goal, a radiometry measurement system is developed to obtain the radiant intensity distributions of UVGI fixtures in a three-dimensional space. This system includes a moving-mirror Type C goniometer, a mirror, a radiometer, a desktop computer, the mechanical control hardware, and the data acquisition/presentation software.

We previously showed that a bitter taste receptor expressed in airway epithelium detects quorum-sensing molecules secreted by Gram-negative bacteria and subsequently triggers bactericidal NO production. We hypothesized that the upper airway epithelium may also be able to detect the Gram-positive aerobe Staphylococcus aureus and mount an NO response. METHODS: Human sinonasal air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures were treated with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-conditioned medium (CM), and NO production was measured using fluorescence imaging. Inhibitors of bitter taste receptor signaling were used to pharmacologically determine if this pathway was involved in the production of NO. RESULTS: A low-molecular-weight, heat, and protease-stabile product found in MRSA CM induced differential, NO synthase (NOS)-mediated NO production. This response varied markedly between individual patients. The MRSA-stimulated NO production was not dependent on 2 important components of bitter taste signaling: phospholipase C isoform beta-2 or the transient receptor potential melastatin isoform 5 (TRPM5) ion channel. CONCLUSION: This study shows that a S. aureus product elicits an NO-mediated innate defense response in human upper airway epithelium. The active bacterial product is likely a small, nonpeptide molecule that triggers a pathway independent of bitter taste receptors. Patient variation in the NO response to MRSA product(s), potentially due to genetic differences, might play a role in pathophysiology of Gram-positive upper respiratory infections and/or pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis."

We believe that the more precise understanding of pathogenesis, the more effective preventative and therapeutic measures, and the lower infection rate. The implants are colonized by airborne, skin-, and/ or surgeon-related bacteria during surgery despite being operated in closely respected operating regime. Some prosthetic characteristics are advantageous and may play important roles in the process of bacterial adherence. After successful attachment on the biomaterial surface bacteria multiply and physiologically transform into a ""biofilm"" community, making them much more resistant to antibiotic therapy and host immunity. Bacterial resistance is a complex phenomenon influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the cell configuration in the biofilm community. So the cure of periprosthetic sepsis without removing of all foreign bodies and necrotic bone fragments is often ineffective. Acute hematogenous sepsis is suggestive of a distortion of a previously aseptic joint space by invasion of bacteria through the vessels."

Prevention of this challenging complication through implementation of effective strategies should be a priority. These strategies should encompass various levels of patient care. Multiple modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled hyperglycemia, obesity, smoking, substance abuse, and nasal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus have been described for PJI. Preoperative recognition and mitigation of these risk factors along with optimization of nonmodifiable risk factors such as kidney, liver, or immune system insufficiency can considerably decrease the risk of PJI. A comprehensive perioperative protocol should involve optimization of the operative environment to reduce the number of bacteria and particulates in the air. Several surgical and nonsurgical details of intraoperative care such as maintenance of normothermia, skin preparation, surgical field irrigation, wound closure, and duration of surgical and anesthetic procedure can influence the occurrence of PJI. Prophylactic perioperative antibiotic administration is probably one of the most important strategies in preventing PJI. Implementation of surgical safety checklist can diminish the risk of perioperative complications, particularly surgical site infection. Controversy regarding efficacy, efficiency, and optimization of some preventive measures continues to exist due to inconsistency or inadequacy of available evidence.

Non-typhoidal serovars cause gastroenteritis in humans. Salmonella can grow on surfaces forming biofilms, contributing to its persistence since biofilms are difficult to eradicate due to the high resistance to antimicrobials and disinfectants. It has been described that there are two crucial biofilm promoting factors in Salmonella: curli and cellulose. The expression of both factors is coordinately regulated by the transcriptional regulator CsgD. Most biofilm studies of Salmonella have been performed by growing bacteria in low osmolarity rich medium and low temperature (25 degrees C). In such conditions, the biofilm is formed at the air-liquid interface (pellicle biofilm). Remarkably, when Salmonella grow in minimal medium, biofilm formation switches from the air-liquid interface to the solid-liquid interface (bottom biofilm). In this report, the switching between pellicle and bottom biofilm has been characterized. Our data indicate that curli, but not cellulose, is crucial for the formation of both kinds of biofilms. In minimal medium, conditions promoting formation of bottom biofilm, a high transcriptional expression of csgD and consequently of the genes involved in the synthesis of curli and cellulose was detected. The nutritional status of the cells seems to be pivotal for the spatial distribution of the biofilms formed. When bacteria is growing in minimal medium the addition of amino acids downregulates the expression of csgB and causes the switch between bottom and pellicle biofilm. The crosstalk between general metabolism and biofilm formation is also highlighted by the fact that the metabolic sensor cAMP modulates the type of biofilm generated by Salmonella. Moreover, cAMP regulates transcriptional expression of csgD and stimulates pellicle biofilm formation, suggesting that the physiological conditions define the type of biofilm formed by Salmonella. The consequences of the switching between pellicle and bottom biofilm during either infection or survival in natural environments remain undercover."

Acrolein and other anti-inflammatory thiol-reactive electrophiles, cinnamaldehyde, curcumin, and sulforaphane, similarly inhibited allergen-induced production of these cytokines from human or murine airway epithelial cells in vitro. Based on our previous observations indicating the importance of Ca2+-dependent signaling, activation of the NADPH oxidase DUOX1, and Src/EGFR-dependent signaling in allergen-induced epithelial secretion of these cytokines, we explored the impact of acrolein on these pathways. Acrolein and other thiol-reactive electrophiles were found to dramatically prevent allergen-induced activation of DUOX1 as well as EGFR, and acrolein was capable of inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity via modification of C797. Biotin-labeling strategies indicated increased cysteine modification and carbonylation of Src, EGFR, as well as DUOX1, in response to acrolein exposure in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that direct alkylation of these proteins on accessible cysteine residues may be responsible for their inhibition. Collectively, our findings indicate a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of CS-derived acrolein and other thiol-reactive electrophiles, by directly inhibiting DUOX1- and EGFR-mediated airway epithelial responses to airborne allergens."

Presently, we developed an in vitro competition assay to select for individual facultative anaerobes of poultry enteric origin that could exclude Salmonella. Using this assay, 24 isolates were selected and stored individually. These 24 isolates were amplified in batch culture (tryptic soy broth, 4 h at 40degreesC) and administered at final dilutions of 10, 100, or 1,000 cfu to day-of-hatch poults. Forty-eight hours later, poults were challenged with 100 to 1,000 cfu antibiotic-resistance-marked Salmonella enteritidis PT 13A by oral gavage.

Selected lactose-negative, antibiotic-resistant colonies typical of Salmonella were further confirmed by serogrouping. Treatment-related protection ranged from 0 to 100\% in three experiments.

What is perhaps less appreciated is that the caseload of tuberculosis patients in South Asia is staggering. South Asia has almost 40\% of the global TB burden with 4,028,165 cases in 2015. This region also has a disproportionate share of TB deaths (681,975 deaths, 38\% of the global burden). Worldwide just 12.5\% of TB cases are in HIV positive individuals, but much research and investment has focused on HIV-associated TB. Only 3.5\% of patients with tuberculosis in South Asia have HIV co-infection. Not surprisingly with such a huge burden of disease, this region has an estimated 184,336 multi drug resistant (MDR) cases among notified TB cases which accounts for a third of global MDR burden. Crucially, at least 70\% of the estimated MDR cases remain untreated in this region and MDR treatment success ranged from only 46\% for India to 88\% for Sri Lanka in the 2012 cohort that received treatment. This region represents many of the drivers of the modern TB epidemic: rapid urbanization and high density populations with dramatically rising incidence of diabetes, a burgeoning and largely unregulated private sector with escalating drug resistance and high air pollution both outdoor and household. Conclusion: From bacterial biochemistry to policy implementation, we suggest ways in which South Asia can seize the opportunity lead global TB elimination by demonstrating feasibility in some of the world's most densely populated cities and remotest reaches of the Himalayas. Clearly political will is essential, but we cannot defeat TB without understanding how to eliminate it in South Asia."

Recent studies suggest that modulating the host immune response can improve survival, but specific host targets for accomplishing this goal remain to be identified. The extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin-1 is released at sites of tissue injury and modulates several immune functions, but its role in C. albicans pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here, we show that mice lacking thrombospondin-1 have an advantage in surviving disseminated candidiasis and more efficiently clear the initial colonization from kidneys despite exhibiting fewer infiltrating leukocytes. By examining local and systemic cytokine responses to C. albicans and other standard inflammatory stimuli, we identify a crucial function of phagocytes in this enhanced resistance. Subcutaneous air pouch and systemic candidiasis models demonstrated that endogenous thrombospondin-1 enhances the early innate immune response against C. albicans and promotes activation of inflammatory macrophages (inducible nitric oxide synthase(+), IL-6(high), TNF-alpha(high), IL-10(low)), release of the chemokines MIP-2, JE, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, and CXCR2-driven polymorphonuclear leukocytes recruitment. However, thrombospondin-1 inhibited the phagocytic capacity of inflammatory leukocytes in vivo and in vitro, resulting in increased fungal burden in the kidney and increased mortality in wild type mice. Thus, thrombospondin-1 enhances the pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis by creating an imbalance in the host immune response that ultimately leads to reduced phagocytic function, impaired fungal clearance, and increased mortality. Conversely, inhibitors of thrombospondin-1 may be useful drugs to improve patient recovery from disseminated candidiasis."

The presence of ESBL-/pAmpC-producing commensal enterobacteria in farm animals, such as broiler chickens, is considered one possible source of food contamination and could therefore also be relevant for human colonization. Studies on transmission routes along the broiler production chain showed that 1-day-old hatchlings are already affected. In this study, ESBL-/pAmpC-positive broiler parent flocks and their corresponding eggs, as well as various environmental and air samples from the hatchery, were analyzed. The eggs were investigated concerning ESBL-/pAmpC-producing enterobacteria on the outer eggshell surface (before/after disinfection), the inner eggshell surface, and the egg content. Isolates were analyzed concerning their species, their phylogroup in the case of Escherichia coli strains, the respective resistance genes, and the phenotypical antibiotic resistance. Of the tested eggs, 0.9\% (n = 560) were contaminated on their outer shell surface. Further analyses using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed a relationship of these strains to those isolated from the corresponding parent flocks, which demonstrates a pseudo-vertical transfer of ESBL-/pAmpC-producing enterobacteria into the hatchery. Resistant enterobacteria were also found in environmental samples from the hatchery, such as dust or surfaces which could pose as a possible contamination source for the hatchlings. All 1-day-old chicks tested negative directly after hatching. The results show a possible entry of ESBL-/pAmpC-producing enterobacteria from the parent flocks into the hatchery; however, the impact of the hatchery on colonization of the hatchlings seems to be low.

It seemed very likely that the hatcheries play an important role in transmission and/or contamination events. There are only few data on transmission investigations from a grandparent or parent flock to their offspring. However, reliable data on direct or indirect vertical transmission events in the hatchery are not available. Therefore, we conducted our study and intensively investigated the broiler hatching eggs from ESBL-/pAmpC-positive broiler parent flocks as well as the hatchlings and the environment of the hatchery."

These latter act indirectly destroying the beta-lactamic ring of penicillins. However, this obstacle is overcome by the use of antibiotics which do not contain beta-lactamic rings such as macrolides or associating amoxicillin with clavulanic acid or with new cephalosporins which are more resistant to beta lactamases. To restrict the diffusion of resistance to antibiotics, it is essential to limit their use diagnosing streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis more precisely, thanks to an improved use of micro-biological diagnostic tests and by a more extended use of tonsillectomy in recurrent tonsillitis (more than 6-7 in 1-2 years). Adenoiditis is closely related to the post nasal drip syndrome, to recurrent otitis media and to otitis media with effusion. All these situations could, therefore, represent an indication, although not well defined, for adenoidectomy. Nasopharyngeal obstruction due to adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy becomes critical during sleep when the hypotony of the upper airway muscles becomes additional to the anatomical obstruction. At this point the inspiratory effort required and the consequent decrease of intra airway pressure increase the pharyngeal obstruction suctioning the pharyngeal walls toward the median line. The resulting clinical picture is defined as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (idiopathic), to be distinguished from SDB due to cranio-facial abnormalities or neuromuscular diseases. SDB includes both the more serious sleep apnea syndrome and the less severe upper airway respiratory resistance syndrome. A combination of symptoms and clinical data detectable both while awake or asleep, make the diagnosis simple. During sleep, both apnea and paradoxical inspiratory movements are highly specific while snoring is highly sensitive. To evaluate nasopharyngeal obstruction radiography and optic fibre endoscopy are both equally reliable. The gold standard test for non idiopathic SDB is the polysomnography, whereas for SDB, due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, one is limited today to the recording during sleep of O2 saturation or of end tidal CO2. These investigations are, however, generally used up to 2 years of age, when the decision to carry out an adenoidectomy and especially a tonsillectomy is more difficult because of the greater risks which surgery involves at this age. The pharmacological therapy has a purely palliative function and is based on antibiotics, local vasoconstrictors, steroids and theophylline which acts more as an antiflogistic than as a breath stimulant. O2 therapy and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) give better results, but are more difficult to carry out, in particular on a long term basis. Adenoidectomy especially if associated with tonsillectomy, leads to the resolution of the symptoms, but not always to a normalization of functional alterations (hypoxia and hypercapnia). For this reason, it is necessary to act on other factors which cause oedema of the nasopharyngeal mucosa contributing to the obstruction. In this area, the prevention of viral infections can be achieved by vaccination against influenza and by preventing the child from attending crowded day care centers. With regard to allergic inflammation, skin prick tests could be a first step in view of allergens avoidance measures. With regard to indoor air pollution, passive smoke must be stopped and the child kept out of the kitchen."

Treatment is often unsuccessful, with infection frequently relapsing. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the etiologic agent of melioidosis, is inherently resistant to many antibiotics. Objective: This article reviews available evidence on the development of vaccines against melioidosis, including live attenuated vaccines, inactivated whole cell vaccines, and recombinant subunit vaccines. Methods: Web of Science and PubMed (1950 February 2010) were searched for relevant reports using the term Burkholderia pseudomallei alone and combined with live attenuated vaccine, inactivated vaccine, animal models, and immunity. The reference lists of identified articles were reviewed for additional relevant publications. Results: Studies in murine models suggest that protective immunity against B pseudomallei may be induced by a range of living and nonliving immunogens. The strongest protective immunity was induced by live attenuated immunogens, although concerns about latency make it unlikely that such vaccines will be appropriate for use in humans. Heat-inactivated immunogens have shown promise, and several candidates for subunit vaccines have been tested. However, in all cases, it has been difficult to achieve induction of sterile immunity and protection against airborne infection. Conclusions: Live attenuated mutants of B pseudomallei have been found to be the most effective immunogens in mice, although it is unlikely that such mutants would be appropriate for a vaccine against melioidosis in humans. The ongoing challenge is to identify nonliving formulations that are able to induce good protective immunity. Both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are likely to be required. In this respect, naked DNA vaccines have the potential to provide high-level protection. (Clin Then 2010;32:1437-1445) (C) 2010 Excerpta Medica Inc"

An untreated person with active TB will typically infect 10-15 other people over the course of one year. Only 5-10% of people infected with TB, however, actually become sick or infectious themselves. Nonetheless, among infectious diseases, TB is the leading killer of adults in the world today, currently killing more adults annually than AIDS, malaria, and tropical diseases combined, and almost 300,000 children. The disease accounts for more than 25% of all preventable adult deaths in developing countries. An estimated 300 million people will be infected during the next decade, 90 million people will develop the disease, and 30 million people will die from it. The global resurgence of TB is being accelerated by the spread of HIV, with TB already the leading cause of death among HIV-seropositive individuals. TB, together with AIDS, has overwhelmed health services and devastated urban populations in parts of Africa. The emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB is of particular concern to the World Health Organization (WHO), surely a factor in WHO's April 1993 declaration of TB to be a global emergency, the first declaration of its kind in WHO history. There is no cure for some multidrug-resistant strains of TB, and there is concern that they may spread rapidly around the world. Curing TB cases is the most cost-effective way to check the spread of TB in communities with high incidence of the infection, and the best curative method for TB is the Directly Observed Treatment approach in which health workers watch patients take each dose of medication throughout the full course of the treatment regimen."

The results of artifical hip replacement are generally good, both in terms of pain relief and the restoration of satisfactory joint function. Nevertheless, as time passes, a high rate of failures have been recorded due to prosthesis infections, fracture and wearing of the prosthetic components and prosthesis loosening by various causes. The use of ultra-filtered air and laminar flow in operating theatres and antibiotic prophylaxis have dramatically reduced the incidence of infections in total hip arthroplasty. Thanks to the setting up of new stem configurations and the use of superalloys that are highly resistant to fatigue failure, the fracture of the femoral component has been virtually eliminated as a complication of total hip arthroplasty replacements. Loosening is thus the most frequent complication in total hip replacement."

Objectives To determine whether or not regular treatment of COPD patients with prophylactic antibiotics reduces exacerbations or affects quality of life. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies. The latest literature search was August 2013. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared prophylactic antibiotics with placebo in patients with COPD. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration. Data were extracted and analysed by two independent review authors. Main results Seven RCTs involving 3170 patients were included in this systematic review. All studies were published between 2001 and 2011. Five studies were of continuous antibiotics and two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis (termed `pulsed' for this review). The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and moxifloxacin. Azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin are macrolides while moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. The study duration varied from three months to 36 months and all used intention-to-treat analysis. Most of the results were of moderate quality. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low, and we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of bias. The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 66 years and with at least a moderate severity of COPD. Three trials included participants with frequent exacerbations and two trials recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics, or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen. The primary outcomes for this review were the number of exacerbations and quality of life. With use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics the number of patients experiencing an exacerbation was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.55; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77, 3 studies, 1262 participants, high quality). This represented a reduction from 69\% of participants in the control group compared to 54\% in the treatment group (95\% CI 46\% to 63\%) and the number needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation (NNTb) was therefore 8 (95\% CI 5 to 18). The frequency of exacerbations was also reduced with continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment (rate ratio 0.73; 95\% CI 0.58 to 0.91). Use of pulsed antibiotic treatment showed a non-significant reduction in the number of people with exacerbations (OR 0.87; 95\% CI 0.69 to 1.09, 1 study, 1149 participants, moderate quality) and the test for interaction showed that this result was significantly different from the effect on exacerbations with continuous antibiotics. There was a statistically significant improvement in quality of life with both continuous and pulsed antibiotic treatment but this was smaller than the four unit improvement that is regarded as being clinically significant (MD -1.78; 95\% CI -2.95 to -0.61, 2 studies, 1962 participants, moderate quality). Neither pulsed nor continuous antibiotics showed a significant effect on the secondary outcomes of frequency of hospital admissions, change in lung function, serious adverse events or all-cause mortality (moderate quality evidence). The adverse events that were recorded varied among the trials depending on the different antibiotics used. Azithromycin was associated with a significant hearing loss in the treatment group. The moxifloxacin pulsed study reported a significantly higher number of adverse events in the treatment arm due to the marked increase in gastrointestinal adverse events (P < 0.001). Some adverse events that led to drug discontinuation, such as development of long QTc or tinnitus, were not significantly more frequent in the treatment group than the placebo group but pose important considerations in clinical practice. The development of antibiotic resistance in the community is of major concern. One study found newly colonised patients to have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. Patients colonised with moxifloxacin-sensitive pseudomonas at initiation of therapy rapidly became resistant with the quinolone treatment. Authors' conclusions Use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics results in a clinically significant benefit in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients. All trials of continuous antibiotics used macrolides hence the noted benefit applies only to the use of continuous macrolide antibiotics. The impact of pulsed antibiotics remains uncertain and requires further research. The trials in this review included patients who were frequent exacerbators and needed treatment with antibiotics or systemic steroids, or who were on supplemental oxygen. There were also older individuals with a mean age of 66 years. The results of these trials apply only to the group of patients who were studied in these trials and may not be generalisable to other groups. Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse."

We report that cell membrane-permeant rhodamine B (RhB)-conjugated peptides based on the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding site of gelsolin can kill the gram-negative organisms Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive organism Streptococcus pneumoniae. RhB linkage to the QRLFQVKGRR sequence in gelsolin was essential for the antibacterial function, since the unconjugated peptide had no effect on the bacteria tested. Because RhB-QRLFQVKGRR (also termed PBP10), its scrambled sequence (RhB-FRVKLKQGQR), and PBP10 synthesized from D-isomer amino acids show similar antibacterial properties, the physical and chemical properties of these derivatives appear to be more important than specific peptide folding for their antibacterial functions. The similar activities of PBP10 and all-D-amino-acid PBP10 also indicate that a specific interaction between RhB derivatives and bacterial proteins is unlikely to be involved in the bacterial killing function of PBP10. By using a phospholipid monolayer system, we found a positive correlation between the antibacterial function of PBP10, as well as some naturally occurring antibacterial peptides, and the intrinsic surface pressure activity at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. Surprisingly, we observed little or no dependence of the insertion of these peptides into lipid monolayers on the phospholipid composition. These studies show that an effective antimicrobial agent can be produced from a peptide sequence with specificity to a phospholipid not found in bacteria, and comparisons with other antimicrobial agents suggest that the surface activities of these peptides are more important than specific binding to bacterial proteins or lipids for their antimicrobial functions."

The plant sample was oven dried at 40 degrees C using hot-air oven and ground into fine powder. The powdered sample was cold extracted using methanol and sterile distilled water in ratio 3:2 (v/v). The mixture obtained was concentrated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized. The crude extract collected was screened for antimicrobial, phytochemical and antioxidant properties. The crude extract was later partitioned into fractions using different organic solvents in the order of their polarity. The antimicrobial potentials of the various solvent fractions were determined using agar-well diffusion method. The active fractions were further partially purified by combination of thin layer and column chromatography. The rate of killing, protein, nucleotide and potassium ions leakages of the active fractions were determined using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as representatives of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria respectively. The most active partially purified fraction was analysed using GC-MS. Phytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, reducing sugar and cardiac glycosides. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the crude extract ranged between 0.545 mg/mL and 2.187 mg/mL while those of aqueous, butanol and ethylacetate fractions ranged between 0.31 mg/mL and 5.00 mg/mL, 0.31 mg/mL and 2.50 mg/mL and 0.31 mg/mL and 2.50 mg/mL respectively. The time kill assay showed that the percentage of the cells killed increased with increasing concentrations of the fractions, as well as, contact time intervals. Leakages of protein, potassium ions and nucleotides followed the same trend observed for killing rate. Vitellaria paradoxa extract exhibited 50\% inhibition of DPPH free radicals at 0.008777 mg/mL, whereas ascorbic acid used as standard had IC50 of 0.078777 mg/mL.

The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize virulent strains of Cronobacter sakazakii from food samples of Bangladesh. Result: Six (6) Cronobacter sakazakii was isolated and identified from 54 food samples on the basis of biochemical characteristics, sugar fermentation, SDS-PAGE of whole cell protein, plasmid profile and PCR of Cronobacter spp. specific genes (esak, gluA, zpx, ompA, ERIC, BOX-AIR) and sequencing. These strains were found to have moderately high antibiotic resistance against common antibiotics and some are ESBL producer. Most of the C. sakazakii isolates were capable of producing biofilm (strong biofilm producer), extracellular protease and siderophores, curli expression, haemolysin, haemagglutinin, mannose resistant haemagglutinin, had high cell surface hydrophobicity, significant resistance to human serum, can tolerate high concentration of salt, bile and DNase production. Most of them produced enterotoxins of different molecular weight. The isolates pose significant serological cross-reactivity with other gram negative pathogens such as serotypes of Salmonella spp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio cholerae. They had significant tolerance to high temperature, low pH, dryness and osmotic stress. Conclusion: Special attention should be given in ensuring hygiene in production and post-processing to prevent contamination of food with such stress-tolerant virulent Cronobacter sakazakii."

Gene expression regulates cell division and differentiation, which affect the biofilm architecture. Mechanical and chemical processes shape the resulting structure. We gain insight into the interplay between cellular and mechanical processes during biofilm development on air-agar interfaces by means of a hybrid model. Cellular behavior is governed by stochastic rules informed by a cascade of concentration fields for nutrients, waste, and autoinducers. Cellular differentiation and death alter the structure and the mechanical properties of the biofilm, which is deformed according to Foppl-Von Karman equations informed by cellular processes and the interaction with the substratum. Stiffness gradients due to growth and swelling produce wrinkle branching. We are able to reproduce wrinkled structures often formed by biofilms on air-agar interfaces, as well as spatial distributions of differentiated cells commonly observed with B. subtilis."

In accordance with previous studies, our fluorescence experiments revealed that the acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethanol, and phosphatidic acid all have high and comparable affinities to adriamycin mainly due to electrostatic interactions whereas binding to phosphatidylcholine was much weaker. Highest affinity, however, was possessed by cardiolipin. Addition of 4 mM CaCl2 reduced the binding of adriamycin to the above lipids. Moreover, in the presence of calcium the affinity of the drug to the different lipids was similar. Ca2+ concentrations > 100 muM began to reverse the binding of adriamycin to cardiolipin-containing liposomes whereas lower concentrations had only an insignificant effect. The association of adriamycin with DNA, RNA, and cardiolipin was then compared by observing the reversal of the cytotoxin-cardiolipin association by nucleic acids. The affinity of adriamycin was found to decrease in the sequence DNA > cardiolipin > RNA with relative affinities of 7.8, 2.3, and 1, respectively. Penetration of the drug into cardiolipin monolayers spread on an air/water interface resulted in an increase in surface pressure pi whereas only a very weak increase was observed using dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine films. Removal of adriamycin from lipid monolayers was achieved by adding DNA into the aqueous subphase. Similar to the fluorescence quenching studies increase in pi after the inclusion of adriamycin into the aqueous subphase was significantly reduced in the presence of Ca2+ concentrations > 100 muM, whereas lower concentrations had only an insignificant effect. Residual drug-phospholipid interactions in the lipid monolayer observed in the presence of Ca2+ were also reversed by DNA."

The highest frequency of nosochomial infection causing organisms in government hospitals are gram negative enterobacteriaceae and was recorded to be the dominant (81\%). The organisms thus isolated were subjected to multidrug antibiotic resistance test which include a group of beta-lactam antibiotics that are frequently used in the treatment. Susceptibility testing revealed that the isolates from government hospitals are resistant to old beta lactams penicillin (95\%), ampicillin (100\%) as well to the first and second generation cephalosporins (cephaloxin-40\%, cephalothin-60\%, cefoxitin-45\%). The plasmids were isolated from these resistant strains and were observed that around 90\% of the isolates had plasmid. The possible reason of antibiotic resistance in the organism being plasmid meditated. Incidences of these multidrug resistant enterobacteriaceae are serious threat to the hospital community. The organism can become endemic within the hospital setting with continued presence in the OPD environment and nosochomial spread.

During colonization within the host, NTHI must acquire essential nutrients and evade immune attack. We previously demonstrated that the NTHI Sap transporter, an inner membrane protein complex, mediates resistance to antimicrobial peptides and is required for heme homeostasis. We hypothesized that Sap transporter functions are critical for NTHI interaction with the host epithelium and establishment of colonization. Thus, we cocultured the parent or the sapA mutant on polarized epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface, as a physiological model of NTHI colonization, to determine the contribution of the Sap transporter to bacterium-host cell interactions. Although SapA-deficient NTHI was less adherent to epithelial cells, we observed a significant increase in invasive bacteria compared to the parent strain. Upon internalization, the sapA mutant appeared free in the cytoplasm, whereas the parent strain was primarily found in endosomes, indicating differential subcellular trafficking. Additionally, we observed reduced inflammatory cytokine production by the epithelium in response to the sapA mutant strain compared to the parental strain. Furthermore, chinchilla middle ears challenged with the sapA mutant demonstrated a decrease in disease severity compared to ears challenged with the parental strain. Collectively, our data suggest that NTHI senses host environmental cues via Sap transporter function to mediate interaction with host epithelial cells. Epithelial cell invasion and modulation of host inflammatory cytokine responses may promote NTHI colonization and access to essential nutrients."

To a great extent their antimicrobial actions are related to the interactions of ILs with cell membranes. Here, we report the effects of ILs on the nanoscopic dynamics and phase behaviour of a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membrane, a model cell membrane, as studied using neutron scattering techniques. Two prototypical imidazolium-based ILs 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM[BF4]) and 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (DMIM[BF4]), which differ only in terms of the alkyl chain length of cations, have been used for the present study. Fixed Elastic Window Scan (FEWS) shows that the incorporation of ILs affects the phase behaviour of the phospholipid membrane significantly and the transition from a solid gel to a fluid phase shifts to lower temperature. This is found to be consistent with our differential scanning calorimetry measurements. DMIM[BF4], which has a longer alkyl chain cation, affects the phase behaviour more strongly in comparison to BMIM[BF4]. The pressure-area isotherms of the DMPC monolayer measured at the air-water interface show that in the presence of ILs, isotherms shift towards higher area-per lipid molecule. DMIM[BF4] is found to shift the isotherm to a greater extent compared to BMIM[BF4]. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) data show that both ILs act as a plasticizer, which enhances the fluidity of the membrane. DMIM[BF4] is found to be a stronger plasticizing agent in comparison to BMIM[BF4] that has a cation with a shorter alkyl chain. The incorporation of DMIM[BF4] enhances not only the long range lateral motion but also the localised internal motion of the lipids. On the other hand, BMIM[BF4] acts weakly in comparison to DMIM[BF4] and mainly alters the localised internal motion of the lipids. Any subtle change in the dynamical properties of the membrane can profoundly affect the stability of the cell. Hence, the dominant effect of the IL with the longer chain length on the dynamics of the phospholipid membrane might be correlated with its cytotoxic activity. QENS data analysis has provided a quantitative description of the effects of the two imidazolium-based ILs on the dynamical and phase behaviour of the model cell membrane, which is essential for a detailed understanding of their action mechanism."

DESIGN: We used Andersen two-stage samplers to collect bacterial samples, the replicate plate method to isolate organisms, and the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method to determine antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: The percentage of organisms resistant to at least two antibiotic classes and all four classes evaluated were, respectively, 2.1 and 3.0 times higher inside (n = 69) than upwind (n = 59) of the facility. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent organism recovered. Concentrations of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus decreased with increasing distance from the facility. Using Fisher's exact methods, the change in distribution of antibiotic resistance profiles for each antibiotic was statistically significant (oxytetracycline, p = 0.010; tetracycline, p = 0.014; ampicillin, p = 0.007; erythromycin, p = 0.035); however, this relationship was not seen with lincomycin and penicillin (p > 0.05). In addition, the levels of antibiotic-resistant S. aureas 25 in downwind were significantly greater than the levels from samples taken upwind from the facility for the same four antibiotics (p < 0.05). The percentage of resistant group A streptococci and fecal coliform increased within the facility compared with upwind values for all antibiotics evaluated, except for lincomycin. The percentage of resistant total coliform organisms increased within the facility compared with upwind values for oxytetracycline and tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial concentrations with multiple antibiotic resistances or multidrug resistance were recovered inside and outside to (at least) 150 in downwind of this facility at higher percentages than upwind. Bacterial concentrations with multiple antibiotic resistances were found within and downwind of the facility even after subtherapeutic antibiotics were discontinued. This could pose a potential human health effect for those who work within or live in close proximity to these facilities."

Two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, namely the airborne strain MFAF76a and the clinical strain MFN1032 were exposed to 0.1, 5, or 45 ppm concentrations of NO2, and their effects on bacteria were evaluated in terms of motility, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, as well as expression of several chosen target genes. While 0.1 and 5 ppm of NO2did not lead to any detectable modification in the studied phenotypes of the two bacteria, several alterations were observed when the bacteria were exposed to 45 ppm of gaseous NO2. We thus chose to focus on this high concentration. NO2-exposed P. fluorescens strains showed reduced swimming motility, and decreased swarming in case of the strain MFN1032. Biofilm formed by NO2-treated airborne strain MFAF76a showed increased maximum thickness compared to non-treated cells, while NO2 had no apparent effect on the clinical MFN1032 biofilm structure. It is well known that biofilm and motility are inversely regulated by intracellular c-di-GMP level. The c-di-GMP level was however not affected in response to NO2 treatment. Finally, NO2-exposed P fluorescens strains were found to be more resistant to ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol. Accordingly, the resistance nodulation cell division (RND) MexEF-OprN efflux pump encoding genes were highly upregulated in the two P fluorescens strains. Noticeably, similar phenotypes had been previously observed following a NO treatment. Interestingly, an hmp-homolog gene in P. fluorescens strains MFAF76a and MFN1032 encodes a NO dioxygenase that is involved in NO detoxification into nitrites. Its expression was upregulated in response to NO2, suggesting a possible common pathway between NO and NO2 detoxification. Taken together, our study provides evidences for the bacterial response to NO2 toxicity."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae a homologue was shown to play a role in biosynthesis of coenzyme Q. Consistently, reduced coenzyme Q content in the generated horA mutant indicated a respective function in A. fumigatus. Since coenzyme Q is involved in cellular respiration and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, the strain horA displayed an impaired response to both oxidative and reductive stress, a delay in germination and an accumulation of NADH. Moreover, an increased resistance against antifungal drugs was observed. All phenotypes were completely reversed by the addition of the synthetic electron carrier menadione. The deletion strain horA showed significantly attenuated virulence in two murine infection models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Therefore, the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q and, particularly, the fungal-specific protein HorA play a crucial role in virulence of A. fumigatus.

Methods: For determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) the method of microdilutionaccording to the recommended procedure of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute was used. Inaddition to that, a qualitative determination was performed by agar dilution. Unsusceptible E. coli speciesselected via agar dilution with cefotaxime were confirmed by MALDI-TOF and ESBL encoding genes wereidentified by PCR.

R-variant bacteria produced exclusively low-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide. They exhibited increased lysis in the presence of plain air. In contrast, the S variants produced low- and high-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide and did not exhibit increased lysis in the presence of plain air.

Airborne spread and subsequent contamination of surfaces adjacent to patients may contribute to transmission. Hence, isolation measures for patients colonized or infected with MDRO at their respiratory tract are intended to interrupt such transmission. However, the potential for microbial shedding in patients with MDRO-positive microbiological reports from their respiratory tract and factors justifying the need for single room isolation are viewed controversially. Methods: Cough aerosol produced by patients colonized with MDROs was measured for viable counts. Descriptive analysis together with logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of strength of cough on growth of MDRO on culture plates. Results: In 18\% (23/128) MDRO were transmitted. Multivariate analysis revealed that strength of cough significantly predicts the yield of MDRO on culture plates (P = 0.012).

Nocardia is a genus of gram-positive Actinomycetes that are ubiquitous in decaying organic material, soil, and water. Some Nocardia species can infect humans, mainly by airborne transmission. Several reports describe disseminated infections, which are rare and mostly affect strongly immunocompromised patients because intact T-cell mediated immunity is the major protective mechanism. Case Report. We report a case of disseminated pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous infection with Nocardia farcinica in a 66-year-old kidney transplant recipient treated with low-dose triple immunosuppression. The patient was initially admitted because of severe hyponatremia and pneumonia with radiologic signs of pleural effusion. The infectious agent was isolated when cutaneous lesions developed. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment led to severe hyponatremia; therefore, long-term treatment with parenteral amikacin and minocycline was initiated. After 7 months of consistent intravenous treatment, the lesions completely resolved and treatment was stopped, against some expert suggestions. The patient had remained free of relapse at the time of writing. Conclusions. Disseminated Nocardia infection in immunocompromised patients is a rare but life-threatening disease. Owing to its infrequency, the variety of clinical patterns, antimicrobial resistance, and often fatal complications of standardized therapy, the diagnosis and treatment of this infection remain challenging and protracted."

In total, 119 ESBL-producing E. coli were isolated from feces, air samples, water, sludge and soil samples. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that the ESBL-producing isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics and isolates of different origin within the same farm showed similar resistance phenotypes. Both CTX-M and TEM ESBL-encoding genes were detected in these isolates. CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15 were the predominant ESBL genes identified.

A slow sustained-release of ClO2 from micelles over fifteen days was detected for long-term release-killing. Micelles only release ClO2 on demand in minimum inhibitory concentrations. We prepared nanoparticles which were covalently clustered on micelle surfaces to improve contact-killing as well as to improve the stability of the micelle. Copper nanoparticles were generated using the biosynthesis method including l-vitamin C, which avoids the toxicity and allows for the preparation of copper nanoparticles in a green environment. Synergistic anti-pathogen activity could be generated by a combination of micelle released ClO2 and ascorbic acid. In addition to release-killing and contact-killing, a pluronic polymer coated surface also provides an additional anti-adhesion property through its protein-repelling ability. In this research, the designed coating demonstrated a broad-spectrum of activity to kill drug-resistant bacteria, viruses and spores in short period of time. Based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and anti-oxidase assays, we found that the designed coatings killed the pathogens via bio-oxidation. We also carried out acute respiratory toxicity tests in this research. Analysis of blood samples, lung function and histopathological slices indicated that the synthesized micelles allowed a controlled and sustained release of ClO2 to kill pathogens while maintaining an overall ClO2 concentration in the air within a safe range."

In recent years, the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the rapid growth of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms that often induce critical infection and pathogenesis. Recently, the advent of high-throughput technologies has led molecular biology into a data surge in both the amount and scope of data. For instance, next-generation sequencing technology has been applied to generate large-scale sequencing reads from foods, water, soil, air, and specimens to identify microbiota and their functions based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, respectively. In addition, oolong tea is partially fermented and is the most widely produced tea in Taiwan. Many studies have shown the benefits of oolong tea in inhibiting obesity, reducing dental plaque deposition, antagonizing allergic immune responses, and alleviating the effects of aging. However, the microbes and their functions present in oolong tea remain unknown. Results: To understand the relationship between Taiwanese oolong teas and bacterial communities, we designed a novel bioinformatics scheme to identify AMPs and their functional types based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analysis of high-throughput transcriptome data. Four types of oolong teas (Dayuling tea, Alishan tea, Jinxuan tea, and Oriental Beauty tea) were subjected to 16S ribosomal DNA and total RNA extraction and sequencing. Metagenomics analysis results revealed that Oriental Beauty tea exhibited greater bacterial diversity than other teas. The most common bacterial families across all tea types were Bacteroidaceae (21.7\%), Veillonellaceae (22\%), and Fusobacteriaceae (12.3\%). Metatranscriptomics analysis results revealed that the dominant bacteria species across all tea types were Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Chryseobacterium sp. StRB126, which were subjected to further functional analysis. A total of 8194 (6.5\%), 26,220 (6.1\%), 5703 (5.8\%), and 106,183 (7.8\%) reads could be mapped to AMPs. Conclusion: We found that the distribution of anti-gram-positive and anti-gram-negative AMPs is highly correlated with the distribution of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in Taiwanese oolong tea samples."

Despite related morbidity, the need for surgical resections coincides with the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This study presents a single-institution retrospective audit of the surgical management of 23 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Methods: We analyzed 23 consecutive patients undergoing anatomic pulmonary resections for human immunodeficiency virus-negative multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Twenty were male (87\%) and 3 were female (13\%); their mean age was 24.4 years. We defined resistance in this cohort as failure to respond to combination chemotherapy, including isoniazid and rifampicin, with a mean duration of administration being 90 days. Fifteen of 23 (65.3\%) patients, although sputum negative, were considered at risk for relapse owing to extensive parenchymal disease. Eight (34.7\%) of 23 patients were sputum positive at the time of operation. We performed pneumonectomy on 11 (47.8\%) and lobectomy on 12 (52\%) patients. All had adjuvant chemotherapy for 18 to 24 months, with follow-ups ranging from 14 to 27 months. Results: Stay in the intensive treatment unit was 2.9 days (range 1-17 days) and hospital stay, 8.6 days (range 5-45 days). Four (17\%) patients had prolonged air leak, 3 (13\%) required further treatment for empyema, with re-exploration for bleeding in 1 (4\%). Hospital mortality was 4.3\%. All patients attained sputum-negative status postoperatively (range 1-5 months). One (4\%) patient had a relapse after 12 months. Conclusion: Surgery should be considered as an adjunct to medical therapy when eradicating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in affected patients. Anatomic lung resections can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Early referral of such patients for surgical consideration is warranted."

G beta-like CpcB (cross pathway control B) belongs to a WD40 repeat protein family with the conserved G-H and W-D residues. Previous studies have demonstrated that G beta-like proteins cooperate with related signal transduction proteins to function during many important developmental processes in A. fumigatus. However, the molecular characteristics of G beta-like CpcB have not yet been identified. In this study, we demonstrated that the G-H residues in WD repeat 1, 2, 3, and the W-D residue in WD repeat 2 of CpcB are required not only to control normal hyphal growth and conidiation but also to affect antifungal drug susceptibility. The enhanced drug resistance might be due to reduced intracellular drug accumulation and altered ergosterol component. Moreover, we find that the first G-H residue of CpcB plays an important role in the virulence of A. fumigatus. To our knowledge, this is the first report for finding the importance of the conserved G-H and W-D residues for a G beta-like protein in understanding of G protein functions."

The mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52 days. The fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to that in septic tank effluent, Gamma(Res), for E. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the AIR treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the LEACH treatment.

Tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100\% for E. coli and from 95.9 to 100\% for fecal streptococci.

The concepts of droplet and airborne transmission that are entrenched in clinical practice have recently been shown to be more complex than previously thought. Several randomised clinical trials of facemasks have been conducted in community and healthcare settings, using widely varying interventions, including mixed interventions (such as masks and handwashing), and diverse outcomes. Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance. Two trials in healthcare workers favoured respirators for clinical respiratory illness. The use of reusable cloth masks is widespread globally, particularly in Asia, which is an important region for emerging infections, but there is no clinical research to inform their use and most policies offer no guidance on them. Health economic analyses of facemasks are scarce and the few published cost effectiveness models do not use clinical efficacy data. The lack of research on facemasks and respirators is reflected in varied and sometimes conflicting policies and guidelines. Further research should focus on examining the efficacy of facemasks against specific infectious threats such as influenza and tuberculosis, assessing the efficacy of cloth masks, investigating common practices such as reuse of masks, assessing compliance, filling in policy gaps, and obtaining cost effectiveness data using clinical efficacy estimates."

Samples from 61 aircraft high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters were analyzed with a custom microarray of 16S rRNA gene sequences (PhyloChip), representing bacterial lineages. A total of 606 subfamilies from 41 phyla were detected. The most abundant bacterial subfamilies included bacteria associated with humans, especially skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and with water and soil habitats. Operational taxonomic units that contain important human pathogens as well as their close, more benign relatives were detected. When compared to 43 samples of urban outdoor air, aircraft samples differed in composition, with higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria lineages in aircraft samples, and higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria lineages in outdoor air samples. In addition, aircraft and outdoor air samples differed in the incidence of taxa containing human pathogens. Overall, these results demonstrate that HEPA filter samples can be used to deeply characterize bacterial diversity in aircraft air and suggest that the presence of close relatives of certain pathogens must be taken into account in probe design for aircraft biosensors. Practical Implications A biosensor that could be deployed in commercial aircraft would be required to function at an extremely low false alarm rate, making an understanding of microbial background important. This study reveals a diverse bacterial background present on aircraft, including bacteria closely related to pathogens of public health concern. Furthermore, this aircraft background is different from outdoor air, suggesting different probes may be needed to detect airborne contaminants to achieve minimal false alarm rates. This study also indicates that aircraft HEPA filters could be used with other molecular techniques to further characterize background bacteria and in investigations in the wake of a disease outbreak."

Seventy-four percent of the isolates were sensitive to the six tested fungicides, and the other 26\% of the isolates were classified into 10 phenotypes characterized by resistance to one or more fungicides. Resistant isolates showed fitness parameters similar or reduced in comparison to sensitive isolates. Resistance to benzimidazoles and to dicarboximides was the most frequent (up to 25\%) and apparently pre-existed in the populations tested. Increased frequency of benzimidazole resistance, but not dicarboximide resistance, was observed following the 3 years of applications of the fungicides. High level resistance to pyrimethanil was present at a frequency of about 2\% in both vineyards in the first 2 years of the sampling survey and reached 10\% in the third year at Site 2.

Specific consequences of innovation failure include the failure of research and development to deliver new medicines to address threats such as widespread and increasing antibiotic resistance, the rise of airborne multidrug-resistant or totally drug-resistant tuberculosis, as well as a lack of new drugs to deal with emerging threats such as Ebola. Persistent constraints to knowledge creation exist in the form of market failure, or the failure of profit-seeking models of innovation to internalise the positive externalities associated with innovations, as well as academic failure, or the failure of academic research to provide much-needed innovations to address societal problems. However, a lack of theory exists as to how to transcend these constraints to knowledge aggregation. This paper presents a probabilistic theoretical framework of innovation, suggesting that the `wisdom of the crowd', or emergent properties of problem-solving, may emerge as a function of scale when crowdsourcing principles are applied to research and development. It is argued in this paper that the consequences of a lack of knowledge of innovation failure are already upon us, and that a radical new approach to knowledge management and innovation is needed."

In this study, data on patients with hematologic malignancies who had an invasive infection due to Trichosporon diagnosed at the Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, were analyzed. METHODS: Positive blood cultures obtained between 1986 and 1996 were reviewed. Medical records of all patients who were positive for Trichosporon in their blood culture or autopsy material were then examined. RESULTS: A total of nine patients with hematologic malignancies were reported positive for Trichosporon cutaneum in their blood culture or at the time of autopsy. The average age was 52 years, and all patients except 2 had acute leukemia. All 8 patients with positive blood cultures were neutropenic, and the average duration of neutropenia before the positive blood cultures were obtained was 43 (range, 0-101) days. For prophylaxis of fungal infection, eight patients were kept in a laminar air flow room and also received nebulization with amphotericin B. Five patients received oral amphotericin B. All 9 patients died of the infection an average of 9 days after their blood cultures turned positive. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were evaluated in six available strains obtained from the patients. They were all resistant to amphotericin B and azoles.

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation: review of infection control practices and skin test results of healthcare workers (HCWs); medical records of hospitalized TB patients and mycobacteriology reports; submission of specimens for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing; and an assessment of the air-handling system. SETTING: A teaching hospital in upstate New York. RESULTS: Skin-test conversions occurred among 46 (6.6%) of 696 HCWs tested from August through October 1991. Rates were highest on two units (29% and 20%); HCWs primarily assigned to these units had a higher risk for conversion compared with HCWs tested following previous incidents of exposure to TB (relative risk [RR] = 53.4, 95% confidence interval [CI95] = 6.9 to 411.1; and RR = 37.4, CI95 = 5.0 to 277.3, respectively). The likely source patient was the only TB patient hospitalized on both units during the probable exposure period. This patient appeared clinically infectious, was associated with a higher risk of conversion among HCWs providing direct care (RR = 2.37; CI95 = 1.05 to 5.34), and was a prison inmate with TB resistant to seven antituberculosis agents. The MDR-TB strain isolated from this patient also was isolated from other inmate and noninmate patients, and a prison correctional officer exposed in the hospital. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all of these patients had matching RFLP patterns. Infection control practices closely followed established guidelines; however, several rooms housing TB patients had marginal negative pressure with variable numbers of air changes per hour, and directional airflow was disrupted easily. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB to HCWs, patients, and a prison correctional officer working in the hospital. Factors contributing to transmission apparently included prolonged infectiousness of the likely source patient and inadequate environmental controls. Continued urgent attention to TB infection control is needed."

Exactly how the environment changes gene expression and how this can lead to disease are being explored in a fruitful new approach to environmental health research, representative studies of which are reviewed here. DATA SOURCES: We searched Web of Science and references of relevant publications to understand the diversity of gene regulatory mechanisms affected by environmental exposures with disease implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, air pollutants, industrial chemicals, heavy metals, hormones, nutrition, and behavior can change gene expression through a broad array of gene regulatory mechanisms. Mechanisms include regulation of gene translocation, histone modifications, DNA methylation, DNA repair, transcription, RNA stability, alternative RNA splicing, protein degradation, gene copy number, and transposon activation. Furthermore, chemically induced changes in gene regulation are associated with serious and complex human diseases, including cancer, diabetes and obesity, infertility, respiratory diseases, allergies, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases. One of the best-studied areas of gene regulation is epigenetics, especially DNA methylation. Our examples of environmentally induced changes in DNA methylation are presented in the context of early development, when methylation patterns are initially laid down. This approach highlights the potential role for altered DNA methylation in fetal origins of adult disease and inheritance of acquired genetic change. CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed studies indicate that genetic predisposition for disease is best predicted in the context of environmental exposures. Second, the genetic mechanisms investigated in these studies offer new avenues for risk assessment research. Finally, we are likely to witness dramatic improvements in human health, and reductions in medical costs, if environmental pollution is decreased."

Scopulariopsis has mainly been associated in humans with superficial mycoses, but it has also been described as the cause of subcutaneous and invasive infections. The most common aetiological agent of infections in humans is Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. This species has been reported to be resistant in vitro to broad-spectrum antifungal agents available today. The aim of the study was to establish in vitro antifungal susceptibility of 35 S. brevicaulis strains against amphotericin B (AMB), flucytosine (FC), caspofungin (CAS), terbinafine (TER), ciclopirox (CIC), voriconazole (VOR), clotrimazole (CTR), miconazole (MCZ), econazole (ECO), ketoconazole (KET), itraconazole (ITR), and fluconazole (FLU). Antifungal susceptibility tests were evaluated by an agar diffusion method (Neo-Sensitabs, Rosco, Denmark). AMB, FC, CAS, ITR and FLU showed no antifungal activity against S. brevicaulis. TER, CIC, CTR, KET, VOR, ECO, and MCZ revealed inhibitory activity for S. brevicaulis, but it varied for each of the drugs. The best antifungal effect was observed for TER and CIC. All isolates had large inhibition zones for TER and CIC. CTR was also inhibitory for all tested S. brevicaulis isolates, but the diameters of inhibition zones were smaller than for TER and CIC. Nearly 89% isolates showed inhibition zones for KET and the mean diameter of the inhibition zone was comparable to CTR. The least antifungal activity exhibited VQR, ECO and MCZ. Because of the multiresistance of S. brevicaulis, infections due to this species may not respond to particular antifungal treatment and other therapeutic approaches should be considered, e.g., combined therapy and/or surgery."

The ABC transporters multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp/MDR1) extrude a wide variety of toxic substances across cellular membranes and are highly expressed in bronchial epithelium. Their impaired function may contribute to COPD development by diminished detoxification of noxious compounds in cigarette smoke. Methods: We examined whether triple knock-out (TKO) mice lacking the genes for Mrp1 and Mdr1a/1b are more susceptible to develop COPD features than their wild-type (WT) littermates. TKO and WT mice (six per group) were exposed to 2 cigarettes twice daily by nose-only exposure or room air for 6 months. Inflammatory infiltrates were analyzed in lung sections, cytokines and chemokines in whole lung homogenates, emphysema by mean linear intercept. Multiple linear regression analysis with an interaction term was used to establish the statistical significances of differences. Results: TKO mice had lower levels of interleukin (IL)-7, KC (mouse IL-8), IL-12p70, IL-17, TNF-alpha, G-CSF, GM-CSF and MIP-1-alpha than WT mice independent of smoke exposure (P < 0.05). IL-1-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, TNF-alpha, G-CSF, GM-CSF and MCP-1 increased after smoke exposure in both groups, but the increase in IL-8 was lower in TKO than WT mice (P < 0.05) with a same trend for G-CSF (P < 0.10). Smoke-induced increase in pulmonary inflammatory cells in WT mice was almost absent in TKO mice. The mean linear intercept was not different between groups. Conclusion: Mrp1/Mdr1a/1b knock-out mice have a reduced inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. In addition, the expression levels of several cytokines and chemokines were also lower in lungs of Mrp1/ Mdr1a/1b knock-out mice independent of smoke exposure.

The regulation of GV assembly in this host is complex and part of a wider regulatory network affecting various phenotypes, including antibiotic biosynthesis. To identify new regulators of GVs, a comprehensive mutant library containing 71,000 insertion mutants was generated by random transposon mutagenesis and 311 putative GV-defective mutants identified. Three of these mutants were found to have a transposon inserted in a LacI family transcription regulator gene (rbsR) of the putative ribose operon. Each of these rbsR mutants was GV-defective; no GVs were visible by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GV deficiency was caused by the reduction of gvpA1 and gvrA transcription (the first genes of the two contiguous operons in the GV gene locus). Our results also showed that a mutation in rbsR was highly pleiotropic; the production of two secondary metabolites (carbapenem and prodigiosin antibiotics) was abolished. Interestingly, the intrinsic resistance to the carbapenem antibiotic was not affected by the rbsR mutation. In addition, the production of a siderophore, cellulase and plant virulence was reduced in the mutant, whereas it exhibited increased swimming and swarming motility. The RbsR protein was predicted to bind to regions upstream of at least 18 genes in S39006 including rbsD (the first gene of the ribose operon) and gvrA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirmed that RbsR bound to DNA sequences upstream of rbsD, but not gvrA. The results of this study indicate that RbsR is a global regulator that affects the modulation of GV biogenesis, but also with complex pleiotropic physiological impacts in S39006."

The abundance and composition of airborne biotic contaminants of all the collected air samples were analyzed using cultivation-independent methods. The V1V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the extracted DNA and sequenced using 454-pyrosequencing. The abundances of 16S rRNA genes and six tetracycline resistance genes (tetB, tetH, tetZ, tetO, tetQ, and tetW) were quantified using real-time PCR. The abundance of 16S rRNA gene and tetracycline resistance genes were significantly higher in SCBs equipped with a deep-pit manure removal system with slats, except for tetB gene. This contrasts with the opposite trend found previously by culture-based studies. The aerial bacterial community composition, as measured by pairwise Bray-Curtis distances, varied significantly according to the manure removal system. 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing revealed Firmicutes (72.4 \%) as the dominant group with Lactobacillus as the major genus, while Actinobacteria constituted 10.7 \% of the detectable bacteria. Firmicutes were more abundant in SCBs with deep pit with slats, whereas Actinobacteria were highly abundant in SCBs with a deep-litter bed system. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the manure removal system plays a key role in structuring the abundance and composition of airborne biotic contaminants in SCBs."

Here, different sizes of particles were sampled from the inside and outside of atmospheric environments of layer and broiler feeding operations using 8-stage Andersen samplers. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 16S rDNA-based sequencing were used to analyze the characteristics of biological abundance and diversity, respectively, according to size. The results indicated that size-related differences occurred in terms of airborne bacterial richness, diversity, and concentration at poultry-feeding operations. The richness of biological genera in the urban atmospheric environment was lower than in concentrated poultry-feeding operations. The biological diversity of airborne bacterial genera, including genera associated with potential pathogens, varied according to size. The bacterial lineages of bioaerosols present in the 7 size stages for layers clustered apart from those for broilers, suggesting that the type of poultry house is a more important factor than the particle size in shaping the microbial communities. In most cases, the concentrations of the 16S rDNA, Escherichia coli, tetW, and tetL genes increased as the particle size increased, with the geometric mean diameters varying from 4.7 to 5.8 mu m.

The aspirated pus culture yielded bacteria of the genus Nocardia that were further identified, in the first step, by phenotypic methods (Gram positivity, partial acidoresistance, airborne mycelium detection, growth at 45C, lysozyme resistance and antibiotic resistance phenotype) as belonging to resistance phenotype V., v.s. N. farcinica (resistance to aminoglycosides except amikacin and to third-generation cephalosporins). In the second step of the polyphasic identification, rDNA was isolated and a 1000 bp part of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Sequence comparison with the GenBank database using BLAST software identified the agent as N. farcinica (100%). The isolate was tested for susceptibility by the NCCLS /CLSI dilution method and showed good susceptibility to co-trimoxazole, amikacin and imipenem. The patient was treated with long-term intravenous cotrimoxazole acid in combination with amikacin and his clinical condition and laboratory parameters of inflammation improved. N. farcinica is among the three most frequently isolated Nocardia species in Europe as well as in the Czech Republic where it was repeatedly recovered from the lungs and respiratory tract of immunocompromised patients with systemic nocardiosis."

Early reversal of severity signs-chest indrawing, hypoxia, and tachypnoea-improves outcome. We postulated that zinc, an acute phase reactant, would shorten duration of severe pneumonia and time in hospital. Methods In a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in Matlab Hospital, Bangladesh, 270 children aged 2-23 months were randomised to receive elemental zinc (20 mg per day) or placebo, plus the hospital's standard antimicrobial management, until discharge. The outcomes were time to cessation of severe pneumonia (no chest indrawing, respiratory rate 50 per min or less, oxygen saturation at least 95\% on room air) and discharge from hospital. Discharge was allowed when respiratory rate was 40 per minute or less for 24 consecutive hours while patients were maintained only on oral antibiotics. Findings The group receiving zinc had reduced duration of severe pneumonia (relative hazard {[}RH]=0.70, 95\% CI 0.51-0.98), including duration of chest indrawing (0.80, 0.61-1.05), respiratory rate more than 50 per min (0.74, 0.57-0.98), and hypoxia (0.79, 0.61-1.04), and overall hospital duration (0.75, 0.57-0.99). The mean reduction is equivalent to 1 hospital day for both severe pneumonia and time in hospital. All effects were greater when children with wheezing were omitted from the analysis. Interpretation Adjuvant treatment with 20 mg zinc per day accelerates recovery from severe pneumonia in children, and could help reduce antimicrobial resistance by decreasing multiple antibiotic exposures, and lessen complications and deaths where second line drugs are unavailable."

A corroded copper water tube caused leakage in a hot water hydraulic installation. The leakage was reported after approximately 6 years in service. Tubes were disconnected from a hydraulic installation and samples were taken for failure investigation. Failure analysis findings suggest strongly that the leakage was caused by tube perforation from the inner waterside due to localized pitting corrosion. The main cause of the accelerated tube pitting corrosion was the improper water chemistry (especially high chlorine content and low pH) inducing chemical attack of copper leading to scale layers of cuprite, chlorides and sulfates.

Samples were collected over a distance of 15 m from the spray site for enumeration. Spores of Bacillus subtilis were used as tracers to estimate the effects of dilution on changes in population over distance. Viable counts of P. syringae, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. planticola decreased significantly over a distance of 15 m. Erwinia herbicola showed no significant decline in counts over the same distance. The degree of survival of P. syringae during aerosolization was dependent on ambient environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, relative humidity), droplet size of the aerosol, and prior preparative conditions. Survival was greatest at high relative humidities (70 to 80%) and low temperatures (12C). Survival was reduced when small droplet sizes were used. The process of washing the cells prior to aerosolization also caused a reduction in their survival. Results from these experiments will be useful in developing sound methodologies to optimize enumeration and for predicting the downwind dispersal of airborne microorganisms, including genetically engineered microorganisms."

Chicken samples were inoculated with antibiotic-resistant strains of S. enterica and C. jejuni at levels of 10(1) to 10(4) CFU and exposed to plasma for a range of time points (0 to 180 s in 15-s intervals). Surviving antibiotic-resistant pathogens were recovered and counted on appropriate agar. In order to determine the effect of plasma on background microflora, noninoculated skinless chicken breast and thighs with skin were exposed to air plasma at ambient pressure. Treatment with plasma resulted in elimination of low levels (10(1) CFU) of both S. enterica and C. jejuni on chicken breasts and C. jejuni from chicken skin, but viable S. enterica cells remained on chicken skin even after 20 s of exposure to plasma. Inoculum levels of 10(2), 10(3), and 10(4) CFU of S. enterica on chicken breast and chicken skin resulted in maximum reduction levels of 1.85, 2.61, and 2.54 log, respectively, on chicken breast and 1.25, 1.08, and 1.31 log, respectively, on chicken skin following 3 min of plasma exposure.

Precision Livestock Farming (PLF), through the combination of cheap technologies and specific algorithms, can provide valuable and rapid information for farmers starting from the huge amount of data that can be collected in real time at farm level.

Air samples were collected once a week in Nalophan bags and transported to the laboratory for instrumental analysis. The prototype was able to discriminate between infected and not infected pens at a very early stage, when only 250 oocysts g-1 [faeces] (opg) were present in one pen. These results were also confirmed by analysing air samples in a commercial poultry farm, since all samples were correctly classified by the prototype in infected or not infected pen.

Methods and Results: Disc diffusion test was performed on 243 microbial strains, isolated from PM10 in winter and summer and belonging to families Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and genera Acinetobacter, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus. Staphylococci resistances were the most heterogeneous, being distributed among almost all tested antibiotics. Staphylococcus isolates resistant to some selected antibiotics were further investigated for the presence of the corresponding genetic determinants. Only tetK, which mediates the tetracycline resistance through the action of an efflux protein, was found in almost all resistant isolates. Conclusions: The lack of specific genetic determinants makes their transmission among staphylococci less likely. This may reduce the theoretical risk associated with the inhalation of airborne micro-organisms. Significance and Impact of Study: Although the spreading of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms is of particular concern in clinical settings, the origin of antibiotic resistance genes can be traced in natural environments. As behaviour, viability and transport of bacteria in the atmospheric compartment suffer from a lack of information, the evaluation of the actual risk posed by airborne micro-organisms to human health is still challenging."

The methods and the results of experiments were summarized as follows: 1. First experiment The propor t ion of INH resistant bacilli in the strains isolated from 9 patients discharging bacilli completely resistant for 5 mcg INH clinically, was examined by using the proportion method, and 2 out of 9 strains did not show full population of resistance for 5 mcg INH. 2. Second experiment 1) To examine the changes of resistance for INH and SM by successive plantation, 10-7 mg or 210-7 mg of Schacht strain were inoculated into 20 Dubos media, respectively (Schacht strain was obtained from Borstel Institute, and showed high resistance for INH and SM). Their resistance for INH and SM of were tested after 4 week incubation. The reading of resistance was made at 4 weeks after the inoculation and no change of the resistant population for INH and SM was observed. 2) Guinea pigs were infected subcutaneously with 1 mg of Schacht strain or H37Rv resistant to INH 50 mcg and mice were infected intravenously with both strains. One or two animals out of them were sacrificed at one, two, three, six, nine and twelve months after the inoculation, and macroscopic findings, weight of the spleen of guinea pig or weight of the lung of mouse, the number of viable bacilli in viscera and the INH resistance of bacilli recovered from viscera were examined. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The bacilli recovered from the lung of mouse showed no decrease of INH resistance. From these experiments, the authors concluded that the reverse mutation did not occur in vivo within 12 months. 3. Third experiment Guinea pigs were infected subcutaneously with 1 mg of strain isolated from patients which showed complete resistance for 5 mcg of INH. Six strains were examined and six guinea pigs were used for each strain. The vilurence of these strains for guinea pigs were markedly different from each other, and generally speaking, these strains showed the attenuated virulence for guinea pigs (Table 3). INH resistance of tubercle bacilli isolated from the viscera of guinea pigs inoculated with KUBO strain showed the marked decrease of resistance for INH (Table 4). 4. Fourth experiment Subcutaneous and airborne infections with INH 50 mcg resistant H37Rv incubated in 5% CO2 incubator, and subcutaneous infection with in vivo bacilli-obtained from lung homogenate of mice inoculated with the same strain and sacrificed at 4 weeks were performed for guinea pigs. After 6 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and examined macroscopic findings and the number of viable bacilli in the spleen, INH resistance of bacilli recovered from the spleen was also examined. But, no increase of virulence for guinea pigs was observed. Guinea pigs and mice were infected with INH highly-resistant strains and treated with predonisolone for 1 to 2 months starting at one month after infection. As shown in Table 1, no marked difference was found in the results between the treated and the untreated guinea pigs. Guinea pigs infected with INH 50 mcg resistant H37Rv and treated with increasing dose of old tuberculin, showed macroscopic lesions in the lung and the liver at 6 weeks after inoculation, whereas no lesions were observed in the viscera of guinea pigs without treatment. From the above experiments, the authors concluded that the attenuated virulence of INH highly-resistant tubercle bacilli and the decrease of INH resistance in vivo after the infection, might be the main factors which give influence on the lower prevalence of the infection with INH highly-resistant tubercle bacilli.  1968, JAPANESE SOCIETY FOR TUBERCULOSIS.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS GOVERNING THE EFFICIENCY OF CHEMICAL DISINFECTION OF THE AIR.","The Journal of experimental medicine","85","1","?",NA,"The effectiveness of any compound as an aerial germicide depends upon the extent of condensation of its vapor on air-suspended bacteria, and on the rate at which the resulting concentration of germicide can produce death of the microorganisms. The properties of any compound conducive to production of the highest rate of kill of air-borne microorganisms by means of the smallest possible concentration of germicide vapor, are as folows: (a) a low vapor pressure, but not lower than 0.001 mm. Hg at 25 degrees C.; (b) high hygroscopicity; (c) toxicity for bacterial metabolism-a high degree of potency is not necessary although the killing action will be more efficient the higher the antibacterial activity of the compound employed. For any compound the killing action is always a direct function of the concentration of its vapor in the air. The maximum amount of a hygroscopic substance which can exist in the vapor state decreases as the relative humidity increases. Hence, at high relative humidities the bactericidal efficiency is lowest. At lower relative humidities the air can contain more vapor, and hence a greater effect is possible. At any relative humidity, the killing action is greater, the more closely the germicide vapor concentration approaches the saturation point. The presence of soluble compounds in droplets containing bacteria promotes more extensive condensation of the germicide than would otherwise occur, and so enhances its effectiveness. In the absence of such soluble substances, low atmospheric humidities may cause complete desiccation of a bacterial particle. Under these conditions its surface may become resistant to the condensation of the vapor, and thus prevent effective germicidal action. The influence of temperature changes on the killing efficiency maybe correctly deduced from a consideration of the effect of a rise in temperature on the vapor pressure of the germicide and on the rate of its bactericidal action in vitro. Equations are presented for estimating quantitatively the magnitude of some of the effects discussed."

Disrupting the assembly and/or function of virulence factors and bacterial biofilms has emerged as an attractive target for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat urinary tract infection, particularly in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance among human pathogens. UPEC vary widely in their genetic and molecular phenotypes and more data are needed to understand the features that distinguish isolates as more or less virulent and as more robust biofilm formers or poor biofilm formers. Curli are extracellular functional amyloid fibers produced by E. coli that contribute to pathogenesis and influence the host response during urinary tract infection (UTI). We have examined the production of curli and curli-associated phenotypes including biofilm formation among a specific panel of human clinical UPEC that has been studied extensively in the mouse model of UTI. Motility, curli production, and curli-associated biofilm formation attached to plastic were the most prevalent behaviors, shared by most clinical isolates.

Environmental decontamination is an important component of all strategies to prevent HCAI as many bacterial causes survive and persist in the environment, which serve as ongoing reservoirs of infection. Current approaches such as cleaning with detergents and the use of chemical disinfectant are suboptimal. We assessed the efficacy of helium and helium-air plasma in killing Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile on a glass surface and studied the impact on bacterial cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both plasma types exhibited bactericidal effects on Staph. aureus (log3.6 - >log7), with increased activity against methicillin-resistant strains, but had a negligible effect on Cl. difficile spores (<1log). AFM demonstrated cell surface disruption. The addition of air increased the microbicidal activity of the plasma and decreased the exposure time required for an equivalent log reduction. Further evaluation of cold plasma systems is warranted with, for example, different bacteria and on surfaces more reminiscent of the health care environment as this approach has potential as an effective decontaminant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Many bacterial causes of healthcare infection can survive in the inanimate environment for lengthy periods and be transmitted to patients. Furthermore, current methods of environmental decontamination such as detergents, chemical disinfectants or gaseous fumigation are suboptimal for a variety of reasons. We assessed the efficacy of helium and helium-air plasma as a decontaminant and demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus on a glass surface. Atomic force microscopy morphologically confirmed the impact on bacterial cells. This approach warrants further study as an alternative to current options for hospital hygiene."

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation: review of infection control practices and skin test results of healthcare workers (HCWs); medical records of hospitalized TB patients and mycobacteriology reports; submission of specimens for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing; and an assessment of the air-handling system. SETTING: A teaching hospital in upstate New York. RESULTS: Skin-test conversions occurred among 46 (6.6\%) of 696 HCWs tested from August through October 1991. Rates were highest on two units (29\% and 20\%); HCWs primarily assigned to these units had a higher risk for conversion compared with HCWs tested following previous incidents of exposure to TB (relative risk {[}RR]=53.4, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI95]=6.9 to 411.1; and RR=37.4, CI95=5.0 to 277.3, respectively). The likely source patient was the only TB patient hospitalized on both units during the probable exposure period. This patient appeared clinically infectious, was associated with a higher risk of conversion among HCWs providing direct care (RR=2.37; CI95=1.05 to 5.34), and was a prison inmate with TB resistant to seven antituberculosis agents. The MDR-TB strain isolated from this patient also was isolated from other inmate and noninmate patients, and a prison correctional officer exposed in the hospital. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all of these patients had matching RFLP patterns. Infection control practices closely followed established guidelines; however, several rooms housing TB patients had marginal negative pressure with variable numbers of air changes per hour, and directional airflow was disrupted easily. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB to HCWs, patients, and a prison correctional officer working in the hospital. Factors contributing to transmission apparently included prolonged infectiousness of the likely source patient and inadequate environmental controls.

Understanding the epidemiology of human Mycobacterium bovis tuberculosis (TB) in the United States is imperative; this disease can be foodborne or airborne, and current US control strategies are focused on TB due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and airborne transmission. The National TB Genotyping Service's work has allowed systematic identification of M. tuberculosis-complex isolates and enabled the first US-wide study of M. bovis TB. Methods. Results of spacer oligonucleotide and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units typing were linked to corresponding national surveillance data for TB cases reported for the period 2004-2005 and select cases for the period 1995-2003. We also used National TB Genotyping Service data to evaluate the traditional antituberculous drug resistance-based case definition of M. bovis TB. Results. Isolates from 165 (1.4\%) of 11,860 linked cases were identified as M. bovis. Patients who were not born in the United States, Hispanic patients, patients <15 years of age, patients reported to be HIV infected, and patients with extrapulmonary disease each had increased adjusted odds of having M. bovis versus M. tuberculosis TB. Most US-born, Hispanic patients with TB due to M. bovis (29 {[}90.6\%] of 32) had extrapulmonary disease, and their overall median age was 9.5 years. The National TB Genotyping Service's data indicated that the pyrazinamide-based case definition's sensitivity was 82.5\% (95\% confidence interval; 75.3\%-87.9\%) and that data identified 14 errors in pyrazinamide-susceptibility testing or reporting. Conclusions. The prevalence of extrapulmonary disease in the young, US-born Hispanic population suggests recent transmission of M. bovis, possibly related to foodborne exposure. Because of its significantly different epidemiologic profile, compared with that of M. tuberculosis TB, we recommend routine surveillance of M. bovis TB. Routine surveillance and an improved understanding of M. bovis TB transmission dynamics would help direct the development of additional control measures."

For example, agents like automobile emitted platinum group elements and different kinds of organic phthalates and esters have been reported to be accumulating in the biosphere. Humans consistently face dermal, respiratory, and dietary exposures to these particles while indoors and outdoors. In fact, dust particulate matter has been associated with close to 500,000 deaths per year in Europe and about 200,000 deaths per year in the United States. To date, there has been limited examination of the physiological impact of indoor and outdoor dust exposure on normal flora microbes. In this study, the effect of indoor- and outdoor-dust exposure on three opportunistic bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was assessed. Specifically, bacterial growth, oxidative stress resistance, and biofilm production were measured following indoor- and outdoor-dust exposures. Studies were conducted in nutritionally-rich and -poor environments typically encountered by bacteria. Surprisingly, indoor-dust (200 mu g/mL), enhanced the growth of all three bacterial species in nutrient-poor conditions, but slowed growth in nutrient-rich conditions. In nutrient-rich medium, 100 mu g/mL exposure of either indoor- or outdoor-dust resulted in significantly reduced oxidative stress resistance in E. coli. Most interestingly, dust (indoor and outdoor), either in nutrient-rich or -poor conditions, significantly increased biofilm production in all three bacterial species. These data suggest that indoor and outdoor dust, can modify opportunistic bacteria through altering growth, sensitivity to oxidative stress, and their virulence potential through enhanced biofilm formation.

Such diseases include avian/swine flu, the viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), and multiple drug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) to name but a few. Although many countries, through their own Departments of Health, have adopted protocols to report and manage such illnesses, there are limited, if any, guidelines/procedures/vehicles to transport infected patients to centers of medical excellence (COME). Consequently, as these conditions are time-sensitive and many patients never receive adequate medical care, the absence of protocol may violate our duty of care. From our own experience we have learned that medical transport of contagious/infected cases requires complete cooperation and authorization by all government officials responsible for Public Health in the countries concerned as well as in the countries where aircraft would refuel or fly over to reach their final destination. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, we developed innovative safety measures to protect our medical teams/flight crews from contamination during medical evacuation/transport. Those measures included the design, in accordance with International Health Authority Guidelines (WHO, CDC), and implementation, of a compact, portable isolation unit (PIU), ideal for regional ground/air travel. More recently, we have incorporated a disposable biological containment unit (BCU) into our comprehensive protocols which is designed for a Gulfstream III, ideal for trans-ocean/continental travel. Both the PIU and BCU enhance our ability to medically transport patients. We have demonstrated that: (1) efficient movement of the sick/infected patients has a positive impact on their outcome and (2) the creation and credentialing of a global network of preferred providers willing and able to accept such patients facilitates the transfer to the nearest COME rather than repatriations which may not always be practical or realistic.

One of the most crucial lines of defense for mitigating the spread of pathogens in a healthcare facility is the removal of microorganisms from the environment by air filtration systems. After removing the pathogenic microorganisms, the filters used in these systems can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens and pose a risk for secondary infection. This threat, combined with the ever-growing prevalence of drug-resistant bacterial strains, substantiates the need for an effective bactericidal air filter. To this end, a broad-spectrum bactericidal polyurethane incorporating immobilized quaternary ammonium groups was developed for use as an air filter coating. In this study, the bactericidal activity of the polymer coating on high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter samples was quantified against eight bacterial strains commonly responsible for nosocomial infection-including drug-resistant strains, and confirmed when applied as a filter coating in conditions mimicking those of its intended application. The coated HEPA filter samples exhibited high bactericidal activity against all eight strains, and the polyurethane was concluded to be an effective coating in rendering HEPA filters bactericidal."

Control of C. difficile is challenging because the spores are resistant to killing by alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antimicrobial soaps, and most disinfectants. Although initiation of germination has been shown to increase susceptibility of spores of other bacterial species to radiation and heat, it was not known if triggering of germination could be a useful strategy to increase susceptibility of C. difficile spores to radiation or other stressors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrated that exposure of dormant C. difficile spores to a germination solution containing amino acids, minerals, and taurocholic acid resulted in initiation of germination in room air. Germination of spores in room air resulted in significantly enhanced killing by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation and heat. On surfaces in hospital rooms, application of germination solution resulted in enhanced eradication of spores by UV-C administered by an automated room decontamination device. Initiation of germination under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions resulted in increased susceptibility to killing by ethanol, suggesting that exposure to oxygen might prevent spores from progressing fully to outgrowth. Stimulation of germination also resulted in reduced survival of spores on surfaces in room air, possibly due to increased susceptibility to stressors such as oxygen and desiccation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that stimulation of germination could represent a novel method to enhance killing of spores by UV-C, and suggest the possible application of this strategy as a means to enhance killing by other agents."

Methods: Subgingival biofilm specimens from 102 untreated and 101 recently treated adults with chronic periodontitis in the Netherlands were plated onto MacConkey III and Dentaid selective media with air-5\% CO2 incubation for isolation of non-oral GNFR, and onto enriched Oxoid blood agar with anaerobic incubation for recovery of selected periodontal bacterial pathogens. Suspected non-oral GNFR clinical isolates were identified to a species level with the VITEK 2 automated system. Results: A total of 87 (42.9\%) out of 203 patients yielded subgingival non-oral GNFR. Patients recently treated with periodontal mechanical debridement therapy demonstrated a greater prevalence of non oral GNFR (57.4\% vs 28.4\%, P < 0.0001), and a greater number of different non-oral GNFR species (23 vs 14 different species), than untreated patients. Sphingomonas paucimobilis was the most frequently isolated subgingival non-oral GNFR species. Several GNFR species normally found in animals and human zoonotic infections, and not previously detected in human subgingival biofilms, were recovered from some patients, including Bordetella bronchispetica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella pneumotropica and Neisseria zoodegmatis. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were significantly associated with the presence of subgingival non-oral GNFR. Conclusions: A surprisingly high proportion of Dutch chronic periodontitis patients yielded cultivable non-oral GNFR in periodontal pockets, particularly among those recently treated with periodontal mechanical debridement therapy. Since non-oral GNFR species may resist mechanical debridement from periodontal pockets, and are often not susceptible to many antibiotics frequently used in periodontal practice, their subgingival presence may complicate periodontal treatment in species-positive patients and increase risk of potentially dangerous GNFR infections developing at other body sites.

Radiologists who do not correctly interpret radiographs that in retrospect are found to have findings suggestive of TB can be held liable if the misdiagnosis is proven to have resulted from the radiologist's negligence. That a patient who has sustained injury as a result of a radiologist's negligence can sue the radiologist for malpractice is nondebatable. Whether persons who have no direct relationship with a radiologist but later contract TB by being exposed to a TB-infected patient whose diagnosis was missed owing to negligence on the part of a radiologist can sue that radiologist is a question that has not yet been adjudicated in U.S. courts. Radiologists should keep in mind, however, that in recent decades U.S. courts have greatly expanded radiologists' legal duties to third parties and the potential liability for violation of these duties [42, 43]. It should be pointed out that a person who is exposed to a TB-infected patient need not necessarily contract TB to claim injury. Courts have recognized fear of cancer as a compensable injury [44]. It is thus quite possible that they may similarly accept fear of TB as a legally legitimate injury. TB, at one time thought to be a disease of the past in the United States, has reappeared, not only in a more deadly form but also with the associated expansion of potential legal liability. When interpreting chest radiographs or CT scans, radiologists should be more alert than ever to considering TB in the differential diagnosis and to ensuring timely communication of their findings to appropriate persons.

Methods: MICs and MBCs of ABT-773 were determined for 165 strains of pneumococci (113 resistant to erythromycin). Extended phenotypes for the erythromycin-resistant strains were described in terms of intrinsic susceptibility to, and induction of resistance by, the antibiotics listed above. Results: Erythromycin-resistant strains could be divided into 10 extended phenotypes (designated II-XI), two of which (II and IX) predominated. ABT-773 at 0.12 mg/L inhibited 109 strains (median 0.03 mg/L). MICs for the other four strains (of phenotypes X and XI) were 0.25-1 mg/L. MICs were only slighter higher when measured on agar in CO(2) than by the NCCLS method (in broth in air). MBCs were usually less than or equal to2 x MIC, but for 10 strains (eight of phenotype X, one each of types IX and XI) MBCs were >1 mg/L, and three of the latter (all type X) were tolerant. Clones of reduced susceptibility (MICs 1-8 mg/L, increased by up to 32-fold) could be isolated from some strains of phenotypes VII, IX and X, but not from those of type II (efflux mechanism) or from erythromycin-sensitive strains. Conclusions: ABT-773 was active against all 113 erythromycin-resistant pneumococci tested, which belonged to 10 phenotypes. Extended phenotyping of pneumococci revealed interesting and potentially useful subdivisions of the classical phenotypes."

Candidemia is now the fourth leading cause of bloodstream infections in many intensive care units (ICUs). Although a number of risk factors have been identified, antifungal therapy should not be started in non-neutropenic patients until a diagnosis of invasive candidiasis or candidemia is made or presumed in order to avoid the development of resistance. Even a single positive blood culture should be treated, and requires removal of intravascular lines. Fluconazole is the first line agent for treatment candidemia other than that caused by Candida glabrata or C. krusei. High-resolution CT scan pictures showing a halo sign or crescent air sign are helpful for establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Sandwich ELISA can be used to detect circulating galactomannan in serial serum samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood samples may also be used. There are only a few randomized studies of newly developed antifungal drugs compared to conventional amphotericin B (AmB). So far, both AmB colloidal dispersion and AmB lipid complex have failed to show more favorable efficacy or lesser toxicity rates, except for nephrotoxicity. Liposomal AmB, used during febrile neutropenia, did have a significantly lower toxicity rate. In neutropenic patients with invasive fungal infections liposomal AmB proved to be better than conventional AmB in terms of clinical efficacy, mortality and nephrotoxicity rates. The use of tests to achieve an earlier diagnosis combined with more potent treatment formulations such as liposomal AmB may be significant steps towards successful management of invasive fungal infections."

By introduction of a metal centre, new attributes might be added that could help to overcome the problems of difficult to treat diseases, as well as to combat issues with arising drug resistances. However, the application of a number of very potent metal complexes is restricted owing to their poor water-solubility, air-stability and only poor uptake when in contact with cells.

In contrast to most characterized vertebrate species, a large amount of glycogen is eluted as a high molecular form in the first peak of gel filtration column. Structural analyses of total crude soluble proteins and purified alpha-, beta- and delta-crystallin fractions were made with respect to their amino acid compositions and characteristic near-IR Fourier-transform Raman spectra. The results indicate that the major secondary structures of alpha- and beta-crystallins are mainly anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet in nature as judged by the Raman signals at 1242 (amide III) and 1669-1670 cm-1 (amide I) whereas delta-crystallin consists of a significant content of alpha-helices as evidenced by the Raman signal at 1657-1660 cm-1 (amide I). The low intensity of S-S disulfide stretching vibration at 508-510 cm-1 coupled with the presence of S-H stretching at 2560-2580 cm-1 for alpha-, beta- and delta-crystallin pointed to the fact that sulfhydryl groups in most crystallins are resistant to air oxidation during the process of homogenization and protein extraction. It is also found that the relative Raman signal intensities of Tyr, Phe, and Trp residues in purified crystallins correlate very well with the data obtained from amino acid analysis. Especially noteworthy is the demonstrated usefulness of applying Raman techniques in the detection of the microenvironments of the aromatic amino acids such as Tyr and Trp in the native crystallins, which may prove useful in the study of contribution of these aromatic residues to crystallin packing and stability."

Although the biochemical properties of WhiB1, WhiB3 and WhiB4 are known, there is no information about the other proteins. Here, we elucidate in detail the biochemical and biophysical properties of WhiB2, WhiB5, WhiB6 and WhiB7 of M. tuberculosis and present a comprehensive comparative study on the molecular properties of all WhiB proteins. UV-Vis spectroscopy has suggested the presence of a redox-sensitive {[}2Fe-2S] cluster in each of the WhiB proteins, which remains stably bound to the proteins in the presence of 8 m urea. The {[}2Fe-2S] cluster of each protein was oxidation labile but the rate of cluster loss decreased under reducing environments. The {[}2Fe-2S] cluster of each WhiB protein responded differently to the oxidative effect of air and oxidized glutathione. In all cases, disassembly of the {[}2Fe-2S] cluster was coupled with the oxidation of cysteine-thiols and the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds. Both CD and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that WhiB proteins are structurally divergent members of the same family. Similar to WhiB1, WhiB3 and WhiB4, apo WhiB5, WhiB6 and WhiB7 also reduced the disulfide of insulin, a model substrate. However, the reduction efficiency varied significantly. Surprisingly, WhiB2 did not reduce the insulin disulfide, even though its basic properties were similar to those of others. The structural and functional divergence among WhiB proteins indicated that each WhiB protein is a distinguished member of the same family and together they may represent a novel redox system for M. tuberculosis."

In 85.2\% of all barns MRSA was detected in the animal house air. Impingement turned out to be a more sensitive sampling technique than filtration. Other environmental samples such as boot swabs or faeces showed prevalences of MRSA from 55.6\% to 85.2\% at sample level. The level of MRSA was 88.3\% for pooled and 82.1\% for single nasal swabs, in skin swabs the one was 87.7\%, the others was 78.7\%. Spa typing of isolates from air and nasal swabs showed predominantly spa types toll and t034. MRSA prevalences in pigs as well as in various environmental samples were significantly higher in fattening farms than in breeding farms.

The main objective was to undertake broad environmental monitoring and clinical surveillance of IA cases to document fungal dispersion during major deconstruction work and to assess clinical risk. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A daily environmental survey of fungal loads was conducted in eight wards located near the demolition site. Air was collected inside and outside selected wards by agar impact samplers. Daily spore concentrations were monitored continuously by volumetric samplers at a flow rate of 10 L.min(-1). Daily temperature, wind direction and speed as well as relative humidity were recorded by the French meteorological station Meteociel. Aspergillus fumigatus strains stored will be genotyped by multiple-locus, variable-number, tandem-repeat analysis. Antifungal susceptibility will be assessed by E-test strips on Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium supplemented with agar. Ascertaining the adequacy of current environmental monitoring techniques in hospital is of growing importance, considering the rising impact of fungal infections and of curative antifungal costs. The present study could improve the daily management of IA risk during major deconstruction work and generate new data to ameliorate and redefine current guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the clinical research and ethics committees of EHH."

The World Health Organization specifically recommends cough etiquette to prevent the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but implementation is generally poor and evidence supporting its value is lacking. METHODS: We constructed a model to assess `real life' transmission risk by counting viable pathogens from aerosols produced by coughing patients, thus allowing the assessment of outward protection measures in a standardised fashion. During the validation process, we focused on rod-shaped bacteria as surrogates for M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: The Cough Cylinder enabled us to sample Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and mycobacteria from aerosols produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and tuberculosis. Pathogens in droplets and in airborne particles could be sampled. Delayed air sampling allowed specific measurement of persistent airborne particles. CONCLUSION: This novel experimental system allows measurement of aerosol pathogen spread in a highly standardised fashion.

The identification of this actinomycete is difficult because most of its phenotypic characteristics are variable and classical tests are not easy to perform on actinomycetes, Fatty acid analysis is very useful for the identification of these strains, but is not available except in some research or reference laboratories. Morphological (microscopic and macroscopic observations), physiological and biochemical tests (growth properties; macromolecules degraded; citrate utilisation and acid production from carbohydrates; resistance to antibiotics, lysozyme and heat), cell wall and fatty acid analyses and IgG analyses with serum from patients with farmer's lung were performed on 12 environmental isolates presumed to be S. rectivirgula and two control strains of S, rectivirgula. From this, a simple and rapid scheme for the identification of this actinomycete is proposed: optimal growth temperature (55 degrees C); colony appearance based on morphology (filamentous) and colour (beige to orange-brown); microscopic morphology (chains of spores on both aerial and substrate mycelium); growth on NaCl 10\%; cell-wall analysis (type IV); and the verification of antibody response with serum from a patient with farmer's lung.

Animal scientists are uniquely qualified to engage in environmental research, education, and policymaking because of our comprehensive understanding of the complexity of whole-farm management and the interactions between animal management and manure management. Animal science departments have the opportunity to train students to be leaders in addressing environmental issues related to animal production, provided departments incorporate environmental education into curricula. Animal scientists can contribute greatly to the many areas of research that address emerging and current environmental issues, helping to ensure that policy is science-based and mitigation strategies are feasible."

We reviewed all air travel-related tuberculosis incidents reported to the Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections between January 2007 and February 2008 in England and Wales and investigated the effectiveness of contact investigation. Incidents involving air travel were defined according to the World Health Organization's guidelines on TB and Air Travel. We collected data on the index case, the incident and the outcome of contact investigation where available. We identified 24 incidents involving 39 flights. The median flight duration was 8.9 hours (inter-quartile range (IQR) 8 to 11.7). Most flights (36) were from or to a high burden country and 19 of the 24 incidents reported had a smear-positive index case. Two index cases had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. In 17 incidents, no further investigation could be undertaken due to the lack of passenger information. In the remaining seven incidents, the quality of contact information obtained was variable. No further cases of TB infection or disease were identified. This study suggests that the process of investigating passenger contacts of a TB infected individual travelling by air is complicated and usually unsuccessful without dedicated resources and availability of high-quality contact information from airlines. Further research into the effectiveness of contact investigation in this setting is needed."

Thirty-six of the 39 subjects (92 per cent) demonstrated diminished forced flow rates and decreased density-dependent forced flow rates while breathing a helium-O2 mixture as compared to an air mixture. On initial evaluation, there was no significant difference in forced flow rates or density dependence between a group of 18 subjects treated with amantadine and 21 subjects given a placebo. However, the placebo group demonstrated further decreases in density dependence 7 days after initial presentation, whereas the amantadine group demonstrated a significant increase in density dependence (P less than 0.05), which suggested an accelerated improvement in peripheral airway dysfunction in the treated group. After inhalation of carbachol aerosol, 25 subjects showed a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in total respiratory resistance that was prolonged and independent of hay fever history. Airway hyperreactivity gradually diminished during a 7-week period in both groups. There was no significant difference in the initial degree of hyperreactivity or in the rate of improvement between groups. These data suggest that nonpneumonitic influenza infection may be associated with both an inflammatory response predominantly in the peripheral airways and transient bronchial hyperreactivity. By means of its antiviral effect, amantadine may arrest the proliferation of virus and associated inflammatory response in peripheral airways, but airway hyperreactivity presumably related to initially damaged airway depithelium is not attenuated by inhibition of viral replication after infection has been established."

The current literature highlights two main features concerning these `cryptic' Aspergillus species. First, the prevalence of such species in clinical samples is relatively high compared with emergent filamentous fungal taxa such as Mucorales, Scedosporium or Fusarium. Second, it is clearly important to identify these species in the clinical laboratory because of the high frequency of antifungal drug-resistant isolates of such Aspergillus species. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has recently been shown to enable the identification of filamentous fungi with an accuracy similar to that of DNA sequence-based methods. As MALDI-TOF MS is well suited to the routine clinical laboratory workflow, it facilitates the identification of these `cryptic' Aspergillus species at the routine mycology bench. The rapid establishment of enhanced filamentous fungi identification facilities will lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical importance of these emerging Aspergillus species. Based on routine MALDI-TOF MS-based identification results; we provide original insights into the key interpretation issues of a positive Aspergillus culture from a clinical sample. Which ubiquitous species that are frequently isolated from air samples are rarely involved in human invasive disease? Can both the species and the type of biological sample indicate Aspergillus carriage, colonization or infection in a patient? Highly accurate routine filamentous fungi identification is central to enhance the understanding of these previously unknown Aspergillus species, with a vital impact on further improved patient care.

The drug is being recently used in neuroanesthesia during awake surgery for brain tumors and in functional neurosurgery. Materials and Methods: This prospective study analyzed the hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine infusion during electrocorticography in patients undergoing surgery for mesial temporal sclerosis. Dexmedetomidine infusion was administered during intra-operative electrocorticography recording, 15 minutes after the end tidal MAC of N2 O and isoflurane were decreased to zero. Anesthesia was maintained with O2:air mixture = 50:50, vecuronium and fentanyl. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2 ) were recorded across at induction, 2 min prior to dexmedetomidine (PreDEX), 5 min during dexmedetomidine infusion (DEX; 1 g/kg), 5 min after stopping dexmedetomidine and 10 minutes after stopping dexmedetomidine. Results: Forty patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (M: F = 27:13, mean age = 28.15  10.9 years; duration of epilepsy = 12.0  7.9 years) underwent anterior temporal lobe resection with amygdalohippocampectomy for drug-resistant epilepsy. Infusion of dexmedetomidine caused a transient fall in HR in 87.5% of patients and an increase in MAP in 62.5% of patients, which showed a tendency to revert back towards PreDEX values within 10 min after stopping the infusion. Sixty-five percent of the patients showed 25% reduction and 10% of them showed &gt;25% reduction in HR. 47.5% of the patients showed 25% increase and 15% of them showed &gt;25% increase in MAP. These changes were over a narrow range and within physiological limits. Conclusion: The infusion of dexmedetomidine for a short period causes reduction of HR and increase in MAP in patients, however the variations are within acceptable range."

The protocol was also developed in order to study resistance gene transfer. Broilers were first orally inoculated with multiresistant E. coli bearing plasmid genes conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones (qnr), cephalosporins (bla(CTX-M) or bla(FOX)), tetracycline or trimethoprim-sulphonamide. They were then inoculated in their air sacs with the APEC and treated as soon as symptoms appeared. Internal organs from dead or sacrificed birds were cultivated on non-supplemented or supplemented media. The inoculated 078 APEC was recovered significantly less frequently in ENR treated group (26\%) compared to untreated group (47\%). This was not true for other treated groups. Isolates obtained on non-supplemented media had the same susceptibility profile as the inoculated APEC. However, one isolate from the AMX-treated group obtained on AMX-supplemented media was resistant to AMX only, and one isolate from the same group obtained on ENR-supplemented media, showed a resistance profile suggesting acquisition of one of the multiresistance plasmids present in the intestinal microbiota. Molecular analysis performed on this multiresistant isolate confirmed the presence of a conjugative plasmid with qnr and bla(CTX-M) resistance genes. Thus, the experiment illustrated the emergence of resistant isolates in internal organs, probably via acquisition of a plasmid from the intestinal microbiota. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

SSI remain a substantial cause of morbidity and death, possibly because of the larger numbers of elderly surgical patients or those with a variety of chronic and immunocompromising conditions, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Factors causing surgical site infection are multifarious. Several studies have identified the main patient-related (endogenous risk factors) and procedure-related (external risk factors) factors that influence the risk of SSI. The rate of surgical wound infections is strongly influenced by operating theatre quality, too. A safe and salubrious operating theatre is an environment in which all sources of pollution and any micro-environmental alterations are kept strictly under control. This can be achieved only through careful planning, maintenance and periodic checks, as well as proper ongoing training for staff. Many international scientific societies have produced guidelines regarding the environmental features of operating theatres (positive pressure, exchanges of filtered air per hour, air-conditioning systems with HEPA filters, etc.) and issued recommendations on healthcare-associated infection, including SSI, concerning surveillance methods, intervention to actively prevent SSI and approaches to monitoring the implementation of such strategies. Therefore, the prevention of SSI requires a multidisciplinary approach and the commitment of all concerned, including that of those who are responsible for the design, layout and functioning of operating theatres."

METHODS: Industrial hygienists from the New York State Department of Health evaluated 140 designated IRs in 38 facilities within New York State during 1992 to 1998. The rooms were located in the following settings: hospitals (59\%), correctional facilities (40\%), and nursing homes (1\%). Each room was tested with visible smoke for directional airflow into the patient room (ie, negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas). Information was obtained on each facility's policies and procedures for maintaining and monitoring the operation of the IRs. RESULTS: Inappropriate outward airflow was observed in 38\% of the IRs tested. Multiple factors were associated with outward airflow direction, including ventilation systems not balanced (54\% of failed rooms), shared anterooms (14\%), turbulent airflow patterns (11\%), and automated control system inaccuracies (10\%). Of the 140 tested rooms, 38 (27\%) had either electrical or mechanical devices to monitor air pressurization continuously. The direction of airflow at the door to 50\% (19/38) of these rooms was the opposite of that indicated by the continuous monitors at the time of our evaluations. The inability of continuous monitors to indicate the direction of airflow was associated with instrument limitations (74\%) and malfunction of the devices (26\%). In one facility, daily smoke testing by infection control staff was responsible for identifying the malfunction of a state-of-the-art computerized ventilation monitoring and control system in a room housing a patient infectious with drug-resistant tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: A substantial percentage of IRs did not meet the negative air pressure criterion. These failures were associated with a variety of characteristics in the design and operation of the IRs. Our findings indicate that a balanced ventilation system does not guarantee inward airflow direction. Devices that continuously monitor and, in some cases, control the pressurization of IRs had poor reliability. This study demonstrates the utility of using visible smoke for testing directional airflow of IRs, whether or not continuous monitors are used. Institutional tuberculosis control programs should include provisions for appropriate monitoring and maintenance of IR systems on a frequent basis, including the use of visible smoke."

In this review, we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity, physicochemical profiles, and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was estimated to be ca. 20,000 tonnes active substance in 2010. There were several reasons for the initial success of neonicotinoids and fipronil: (1) there was no known pesticide resistance in target pests, mainly because of their recent development, (2) their physicochemical properties included many advantages over previous generations of insecticides (i.e., organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, etc.), and (3) they shared an assumed reduced operator and consumer risk. Due to their systemic nature, they are taken up by the roots or leaves and translocated to all parts of the plant, which, in turn, makes them effectively toxic to herbivorous insects. The toxicity persists for a variable period of time-depending on the plant, its growth stage, and the amount of pesticide applied. A wide variety of applications are available, including the most common prophylactic non-Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) application by seed coating. As a result of their extensive use and physicochemical properties, these substances can be found in all environmental compartments including soil, water, and air. Neonicotinoids and fipronil operate by disrupting neural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates. Neonicotinoids mimic the action of neurotransmitters, while fipronil inhibits neuronal receptors. In doing so, they continuously stimulate neurons leading ultimately to death of target invertebrates. Like virtually all insecticides, they can also have lethal and sublethal impacts on non-target organisms, including insect predators and vertebrates. Furthermore, a range of synergistic effects with other stressors have been documented. Here, we review extensively their metabolic pathways, showing how they form both compound-specific and common metabolites which can themselves be toxic. These may result in prolonged toxicity. Considering their wide commercial expansion, mode of action, the systemic properties in plants, persistence and environmental fate, coupled with limited information about the toxicity profiles of these compounds and their metabolites, neonicotinoids and fipronil may entail significant risks to the environment. A global evaluation of the potential collateral effects of their use is therefore timely. The present paper and subsequent chapters in this review of the global literature explore these risks and show a growing body of evidence that persistent, low concentrations of these insecticides pose serious risks of undesirable environmental impacts."

Filters from the air conditioning systems of 19 taxis and 28 personal vehicles (used as controls) operating in three Portuguese cities including the capital Lisbon, were collected during the winter season. The occurrence and significance of bioburden detected in the different vehicles are reported and discussed in terms of colony-forming units (CFU) per 1 m(2) of filter area and by the identification of the most frequently detected fungal isolates based on morphology. Azole-resistant mycobiota, fungal biomass, and molecular detection of Aspergillus species/strains were also determined. Bacterial growth was more prevalent in taxis (63.2\%) than in personal vehicles (26.3\%), whereas fungal growth was more prevalent in personal vehicles (53.6\%) than in taxis (21.1-31.6\%). Seven different azole-resistant species were identified in this study in 42.1\% taxi filters. Levels of fungal biomass were above the detection limit in 63\% taxi filters and in 75\% personal vehicle filters. No toxigenic species were detected by molecular analysis in the assessed filters. The results obtained show that bioburden proliferation occurs widely in filters from the air conditioning systems of taxis, including the proliferation of azole-resistant fungal species, suggesting that filters should be replaced more frequently.

Material and Methods: The sampling was done by wet cyclone technology using the Coriolis recon apparatus, imprint and swab methods, respectively. In total, 280 samples from 28 ambulances and 10 offices in Warszawa were tested. Data was analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test, Kruskal-Wallis test with alpha = 0.05. Pvalue <= 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The levels of air contamination were from 0 to 2.3 x 10(1) colony-forming unit (CFU)/m(3) for bacteria and for yeast and filamentous fungi were from 0 to 1.8 x 10(1) CFU/m(3).

In the group of 455 isolated strains, up to 19.8\% (90 isolates) were phenotypic ESBL-producers. They were detected in the 63 (100\%) of sewage samples analyzed, 7 (33.3\%) of river water and in 10 (23.8\%) of air samples collected at the WWTP area. The plasmid-mediated genes encoding beta-lactams resistance were detected in almost 10\% out of bacteria of the WWTP's final effluents and in above 32\% out of bacteria of air at the WWTP area. It confirms that those genes are released into the environment, which might facilitate further dissemination among environmental bacteria. Moreover, genes encoding antibiotic resistance were shown to be transferrable to an Escherichia coli recipient strain, which indicates a high possibility of horizontal gene transfer among strains of different genera within the sewage and environmental samples. This study demonstrated that despite the treatment, the municipal sewage may be a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance genes.

To obtain sufficient high-quality RNA after histochemistry and LCM, we included an RNase inhibitor and air-dried the tissue sections. This optimization allowed the visualization of GGT activity in situ and a yield of 1.4 to 2.0 mu g of total RNA from 15 to 18 mm(2) of microdissected tissue (20 mu m thickness). The average RNA integrity number in GGT-positive tissue, determined by chip capillary electrophoresis, was 6.9, and the 28S/18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) ratio was 1.4. The RNAs were processed for the Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix). Comparable quality control metrics, such as signal intensity and RNA degradation plots, were found between the LCM samples and non-LCM tissue. The increased expression of Ggt1 expected in GGT-positive tissue was confirmed by microarrays and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). This optimization provided a suitable method for whole-transcript analysis of GGT-positive tissue isolated using LCM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

These pathogens exhibit a high resistance to antibiotic treatments. In addition, no licensed vaccine is currently available. A nanoscale platinum-containing titania photocatalyst (TiO2-Pt) has been shown to have a superior visible light-responsive photocatalytic ability to degrade chemical contaminants like nitrogen oxides. The antibacterial activity of the catalyst and its potential use in soil pathogen control were evaluated. Using the plating method, we found that TiO2-Pt exerts superior antibacterial performance against Escherichia coli compared to other commercially available and laboratory prepared ultraviolet/ visible light-responsive titania photocatalysts. TiO2-Pt-mediated photocatalysis also affectively eliminates the soil-borne bacteria B. pseudomallei and B. cenocepacia. An air pouch infection mouse model further revealed that TiO2-Pt-mediated photocatalysis could reduce the pathogenicity of both strains of bacteria. Unexpectedly, water containing up to 10\% w/v dissolved soil particles did not reduce the antibacterial potency of TiO2-Pt, suggesting that the TiO2-Pt photocatalyst is suitable for use in soil-contaminated environments. The TiO2-Pt photocatalyst exerted superior antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of human pathogens, including B. pseudomallei and B. cenocepacia. Soil particles (<10\% w/v) did not significantly reduce the antibacterial activity of TiO2-Pt in water. These findings suggest that the TiO2-Pt photocatalyst may have potential applications in the development of bactericides for soilborne pathogens."

The prohibitive cost, however, warrants that this system be restricted to research settings. The suppression of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and fungi and the preservation of colonization resistance with such combinations as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nystatin show promise in preventing infection in the granulocytopenic patient. Prevention of infection in neutropenic patients also requires attention to simpler but very effective measures such as immunizations, antimicrobial prophylaxis against intracellular and nonbacterial pathogens in high-risk patients, limiting invasive diagnostic and monitoring procedures, hand-washing by all personnel between visiting patients, oral hygiene, low microbial diets, axillary and perianal swabbing, and care with venipunctures and marrow aspirates. Finally, while the recommendations for prevention of infection are likely to continue to change with resulting improvement in patient care [92, 93], a tabulation summarizing current practices can be established based on our current knowledge (Table 1)."

Standardized susceptibility test methods are based upon rapidly growing, aerobic microorganisms in which overnight incubation results in definitive endpoints. In vitro susceptibility testing for fastidious organisms that require complex media for growth, require incubation in atmospheres other than ambient air, or are slow-growing (anaerobes, mycobacteria, filamentous fungi) are problematic and in general are not standardized. H. pylori falls into this category of troublesome organisms. For the microaerobic organism H. pylori, testing is challenging because the organism grows slowly even under optimal culture conditions. Recently the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) approved the agar dilution method as the test of choice for testing H. pylori. While not entirely reliable in predicting the outcome of treatment for metronidazole resistant organisms, the resistance determined for clarithromycin by this method generally predicts treatment failure. Quality control breakpoints for H. pylori ATCC 43504 were established and breakpoints for clarithromycin were approved by the NCCLS in 1999. Breakpoints are minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a drug at which an organism is deemed either susceptible or resistant to the antibiotic using standard dosing regimens containing that drug. Significant progress has been made with respect to development of tests to detect antimicrobial resistance, but there still. remains no consensus as to the breakpoints for agents used in the treatment of H. pylori infection other than clarithromycin. This article will address the controversies associated with the reporting of antibiotic resistance data and the interpretation of these data."

Blood and radiologic tests are frequently used for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but it remains unknown which is more useful for its early diagnosis. The aim of the study was to compare usefulness of computed tomographic (CT) scan of chest, latex agglutination (LA) test and determination of plasma (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) levels for early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Design and Methods. We treated 215 consecutive patients who underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy. From initiation of chemotherapy until death or discharge, blood samples were taken weekly and subjected to LA and BDG tests. We performed chest CT scans when patients had any signs of pulmonary infection or an antibiotic-resistant fever. Results. Of the 215 patients, 30 (14.0\%) were diagnosed as having IPA. In sixteen cases the diagnosis was definite and in 14 it was suspected. In patient-based analysis, sensitivities of LA and BDG were 44\% and 63\%, respectively. Sensitivity tended to be lower in patients with IPA localized to the lung than those with disseminated invasive aspergillosis. Specificities were 93\% and 74\%, respectively. Either a halo or an air-crescent was observed in 7 of the 16 patients with IPA, and all of the IPA patients showed some abnormal signs on chest CT scans. On average, CT scan signs preceded a positive LA test by days and a positive BDG assay by 11.5 days. In of the 11 patients who became positive for either or BDG assay, CT scan signs preceded the positive results by more than seven days. Interpretations and conclusions. Chest CT scan is more beneficial than the blood tests and X-ray for early diagnosis of IPA. (C) 2000, Ferrata Storti Foundation."

Drug of choice for its treatment are rifampicin and isoniazid respectively. However, in recent times, resistance to these drugs as with other antibiotics has been observed across the globe. This study was thus aimed at determining the prevalence of rifampicin resistance strain among TB patients attending two major hospitals (Braithwaite Memorial Hospital and University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital) in Port Harcourt. Method: Sputum of patients was collected, tested for the presence of TB and rifampicin resistance of the isolates were determined using GeneXpert assay approach. Result: A total of 158 isolates from patients who were TB positive were tested for rifampicin resistance. 13.3\% of these were resistant to rifampicin drug. 8.9\% was from UPTH while 4.4\% was from BUSH. 9.5\% were less than age 45 while 3.8\% were greater than or equal to age 45 (>= 45). Males made up 8.2\% of the total prevalence while females made up 5.1\% of the total prevalence. Alternative drugs to rifampicin and isoniazid drug should however, be prescribed in confirmed cases of resistance outcome in our health facilities especially in the rural communities. Conclusion: Nonetheless, the use of antibiotics indiscriminately without the effective laboratory assay and physician's prescription should be discouraged at all levels and patients receiving treatment should be monitored to adhere strictly to the desired dosage as non-adhering to the gold standard option may lead to drug resistance outcome among vulnerable patients who are literally exposed to lack of health education and functional health facilities in the remote communities which are also hard to reach area due to the environmental terrine."

For this reason, the efficiency of drugs to interact with the membranes constitutes one of the most important pharmacological features playing an essential role in their biological activity. Membranes are the gathering place of many proteins and lipids, and are the structures where most cellular activities occur. Although drugs bind to proteins and regulate their activity, the membrane lipid phase is no less important. Great part of compounds studied induces structural changes in the lipid phase resulting structural defects, which in turn disturb membrane function and indirectly modulate membrane proteins. This paper reviews the clinical significance of drug-membrane interaction studies with a special focus in the lipidic components of the membrane and reinforcing the importance of these studies in the field of medicinal chemistry since they constitute stimulating opportunities for understanding drugs mode of action and toxic effects and cannot be overlooked during drug design and synthesis."

Lindau leaves are widely used by cancer patients and the leaf extracts possess cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects on several human cancer cell lines. However, the effect of C. nutans leaf extract on human melanoma, which is the least common but most fatal form of skin cancer and one of the most common cancers diagnosed in both sexes worldwide, is unknown. There is also limited information on whether the bioactivity of extracts differs between C. nutans leaves grown in different geographical locations with varying environmental conditions. Methods: The present study, for the first time, compared and demonstrated the cytotoxicity of the crude methanol extracts of C. nutans leaves from 11 different locations in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, with diverse environmental conditions against D24 melanoma cells through WST-8 assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells following treatment with the most active extract was determined in a dose-and time-dependent manner by a cytofluorometric double staining technique. Biochemical and morphological changes in the treated and untreated cells were examined by fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy techniques, respectively, to further affirm the induction of apoptosis. Results: The leaves of plants grown at higher elevations and lower air temperatures were more cytotoxic to the D24 melanoma cells than those grown at lower elevations and higher air temperatures, with the leaf extract from Chiang Dao, Chiang Mai, Thailand exhibited the highest cytotoxicity (24 h EC50: 0.95 mg/mL and 72 h EC50: 0. 77 mg/mL). This most active crude extract induced apoptotic cell death in the D24 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Typical biochemical and morphological characteristics of apoptosis were also observed in the treated D24 cells. Conclusions: The results, showing the cytotoxicity of C. nutans and the induction of apoptosis in D24 cells, are significant and useful to facilitate the development of C. nutans as a potential novel chemotherapeutic agent for the management of skin melanoma."

Multiplex PCR of 204 presumptive enterococci using genus (16s rDNA)- and species-specific (superoxide dismutase) primer set leads to identification of six Enterococcus spp., i.e. Ent.faecium, Ent.faecalis, Ent.mundtti, Ent.hirae, Ent.gallinarum and Ent.casseliflavus. BOX-PCR analysis of the representative strains confirmed inter-strain variation among species. Although enterococci generally appear to be catalase negative, Ent.faecalis from some faecal, water and air samples showed catalase production. In vitro assays identified poultry environment as a reservoir of MVD and MAR enterococci and non-enterococci. In addition to vancomycin, high-level-ampicillin-, clarithromycin-, erythromycin-, kanamycin- and gentamicin-resistant enterococci and non-enterococci are also indicated.

The clinical presentation of TB in children is often nonspecific and differs from the patterns seen in adults. MDR-TB cases can be seen in this age group since tuberculosis in children is mainly caused by transmission of drug-resistant strains from adults. This situation is particularly problematic due to the long-term treatment and the lack of specific drug formulations for children."

We found that following in vitro exposure to ROFA, epithelial cells showed an increase in mucin (MUC5AC) and lysozyme (LYS) steady state mRNA. This upregulation was controlled at least partly at the level of transcription as shown by reporter assays. Experiments testing the ability of the major components of ROFA to mimic these effects showed that vanadium, a metal making up 18.8% by weight, accounted for the bulk of the response. A screen of signaling inhibitors showed that MUC5AC and LYS induction by ROFA are mediated by dissimilar signaling pathways, both of which are, however, phosphotyrosine dependent. Recognizing that the ROFA constituent vanadium is a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and that mucin induction by pathogens is phophotyrosine dependent, we suggest that vanadium-containing air pollutants trigger disease-like conditions by unmasking phosphorylation-dependent pathogen resistance pathways."

Antibacterial disinfectants have been partially effective only, indicating the need for novel preventative measures and to understand mechanisms of bacterial resistance. Acanthamoeba is a free-living protist that is known to harbour microbial pathogens, provide shelter, and assist in their transmission to susceptible population. The overall aim of this study was to determine whether S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae can interact with A. castellanii by associating, invading, and surviving inside trophozoites and cysts. It was observed that both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were able to associate as well as invade and/or taken up by the phagocytic A. castellanii trophozoite. Notably, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae survived the encystation process, avoided phagocytosis, multiplied, and exhibited higher recovery from the mature cysts, compared with the trophozoite stage (approximately 2 bacteria per amoebae ratio for cyst stage versus 0.02 bacteria per amoeba ration for trophozoite stage). As Acanthamoeba cysts are resilient and can disperse through the air, A. castellanii can act as a vector in providing shelter, facilitating growth and possibly genetic exchanges. In addition, these interactions may contribute to S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae survival in harsh environments, and transmission to susceptible population and possibly affecting their virulence. Future studies will determine the molecular mechanisms associated with Acanthamoeba interactions with Streptococcus and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria and in turn expedite the discovery of novel therapeutic and/or preventative measures."

Although the current anti-fungal therapies are relatively efficient, some issues such as drug toxicity, drug interactions, and the emergence of drug-resistant fungi have promoted the intense research toward finding the novel drug targets. Methods: In search of new antifungal drug targets, we have used a bioinformatics approach to identify novel drug targets. We compared the whole proteome of this organism with yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to come up with 153 specific proteins. Further screening of these proteins revealed 50 potential molecular targets in A. fumigatus. Amongst them, RNA-binding protein (RBP) was selected for further examination. The aspergillus fumigatus RBP (AfuRBP), as a peptidylprolyl isomerase, was evaluated by homology modeling and bioinformatics tools. RBP-deficient mutant strains of A. fumigatus were generated and characterized. Furthermore, the susceptibility of these strains to known peptidylprolyl isomerase inhibitors was assessed. Results: AfuRBP-deficient mutants demonstrated a normal growth phenotype. MIC assay results using inhibitors of peptidylprolyl isomerase confirmed a higher sensitivity of these mutants compared to the wild type. Conclusion: Our bioinformatics approach revealed a number of fungal-specific proteins that may be considered as new targets for drug discovery purposes. Peptidylprolyl isomerase, as a possible drug target, was evaluated against two potential inhibitors, and the promising results were investigated mechanistically.

Nevertheless, most patients with metastatic disease are not cured owing to the drug resistance. Cancer stem cells are known to regulate resistance to chemotherapy. In the previous study, we established a novel three-dimensional organoid culture model from tumor colorectal tissues of human patients using an air-liquid interface (ALI) method, which contained numerous cancer stem cells and showed resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Irinotecan. Here, we investigate which inhibitor for stem cell-related signal improves the sensitivity for anti-cancer drug treatment in tumor ALI organoids. Treatment with Hedgehog signal inhibitors (AY9944, GANT61) decreases the cell viability of organoids compared with Notch (YO-01027, DAPT) and Wnt (WAV939, Wnt-C59) signal inhibitors. Combination treatment of AY9944 or GANT61 with 5-FU, Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin decreases the cell viability of tumor organoids compared with each anti-cancer drug alone treatment. Treatment with AY9944 or GANT61 inhibits expression of stem cell markers c-Myc, CD44 and Nanog, likely through the decrease of their transcription factor, GLI-1 expression. Combination treatment of AY9944 or GANT61 with 5-FU or Irinotecan also prevents colony formation of colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480.

There have been reports indicating tuberculosis transmission on all travel vehicles, including aircrafts, ground vehicles and vessels until today. However, due to the ever increasing of air transportation and air travelling among countries with low and high tuberculosis incidence, transmission risk especially in aircrafts has become an important issue worldwide. But in many of the studies conducted in this regard, transmission of tuberculosis in aircrafts was found very low. The case of active tuberculosis has not yet been reported. This is due to the fact that in modern aircrafts, there are ventilation systems that provide hepa filtered laminar air flow and change the air 15-20 times per hour. The guidelines for the prevention of tuberculosis infection in aircrafts published by the World Health Organization ""Tuberculosis and Air Travel, 2008"" and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ""RAGIDA-TB, 2014"" confirm each other. According to these guidelines, air travelling of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis should be prohibited until smears of two consecutive sputum samples become negative for drug susceptible cases, and cultures of two consecutive of sputum samples become negative for multidrug or extensively drug resistant cases. When it is reported that a tuberculosis patient has travelled by the aircraft, it is recommended that the exposed passengers should be investigated for tuberculosis infection if the flight duration equal to or exceeding eight hours including ground delays and the time elapsed between flight and diagnosis of the case is no longer than three months. Contact screening is only recommended for passengers sitting in the same row, two rows ahead and two rows behind the index case. Tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay can be used for investigation. It is very difficult to determine the risk of tuberculosis transmission in ground vehicles like buses, subways and trains. The reason is that it is often not possible to access the information of the passengers travelling in these vehicles. Because the ventilation systems in ground vehicles are not as reliable as in aircrafts and the crowded environment in the ground vehicles, the risk of tuberculosis transmission is theoretically higher. In modelling studies, the transmission risk in the buses was found to be higher than the trains. In the case of regular travelling with an index case such as school bus riders, the risk increases significantly. The increased human population travelling all over the world nowadays has also raised concerns about travel-related tuberculosis risk. However, because of the limited evidence, it may be more efficient to spend time and resources for the other actions in order to prevent tuberculosis.

To establish the source and contamination routes resulting in positive clinical and surveillance microbiological cultures with carbapenem-resistant, GIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase-positive Acinetobacter pitii and Acinetobacter radioresistens from 21 patients in 8 departments. DESIGN. Retrospective, descriptive study. SETTING. A 1,300-bed tertiary care academic medical facility consisting of 90 buildings linked by a pneumatic transport system (PTS). METHODS. Microbiological workup of the cluster strains included matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight species identification, phenotypic carbapenemase tests, polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping of carbapenemase, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Outbreak management procedures were employed according to institutional regulations. RESULTS. The rarity of GIM-1 Acinetobacter species in the hospital and region, the lack of epidemiological links between patients, and the fact that in some patients the apparent colonization was clearly nonnosocomial prompted the suspicion of a pseudo-outbreak. Numerous environmental cultures were positive for GIM-1-positive Acinetobacter (including archived sample requisition forms, PTS capsules, cultures from line-diverter and dispenser stations, and sterilized transport capsules following PTS delivery). Moreover, it was observed that condensation fluid from subterranean PTS tubing resulted in water entry in PTS capsules, possibly conferring specimen contamination. After extensive system disinfection, environmental surveys of the PTS were negative, and no further positive patient specimens were encountered. CONCLUSIONS. This is the first report of a PTS-associated pseudo-outbreak. The large number of falsely positive patient-related specimens in conjunction with the potential hazard of airborne and contact spread of multidrug-resistant microorganisms (in this case, GIM-1 carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species) underscores the need for implementation of infection control-based monitoring and operating procedures in a hospital PTS."

BvgAS mediates the control of multiple phenotypic phases and a spectrum of gene expression profiles specific to each phase in response to incremental changes in the concentrations of environmental signals. Studies highlighting the critical role of this signaling circuitry in the Bordetella infectious cycle have focused on planktonically growing bacterial cells. It is becoming increasingly clear that the major mode of bacterial existence in the environment and within the body is a surface-attached state known as a biofilm. Biofilms are defined as consortia of sessile microorganisms that are embedded in a matrix. During routine growth of Bordetella under agitating conditions, we noticed the formation of a bacterial ring at the air-liquid interface of the culture tubes. We show here that this surface adherence property reflects the ability of these organisms to form biofilms. Our data demonstrate that the BvgAS locus regulates biofilm development in Bordetella. The results reported in this study suggest that the Bvg-mediated control in biofilm development is exerted at later time points after the initial attachment of bacteria to the different surfaces. Additionally, we show that these biofilms are highly tolerant of a number of antimicrobials, including the ones that are currently recommended for treatment of veterinary and human infections caused by Bordetella spp. Finally, we discuss the significance of the biofilm lifestyle mode as a potential contributor to persistent infections."

The results obtained for a free drug were compared with the results recorded for DNR attached to SWCNTs as potential drug carrier. Langmuir studies of mixed DPPTE-SWCNTs-DNR monolayers showed that even at the highest investigated content of the nanotubes in the monolayer, the changes in the properties of DPPTE model membranes were not as significant as in case of the incorporation of a free drug, which resulted in a significant increase in the area per molecule and fluidization of the thiolipid layer. The presence of SWCNTs-DNR in the DPPTE monolayer at the air-water interface did not change the organization of the lipid molecules to such extent as the free drug, which may be explained by different types of interactions playing crucial role in these two types of systems. In the case of the interactions of free DNR the electrostatic attraction between positively charged drug and negatively charged DPPTE monolayer play the most important role, while in the case of SWCNTs-DNR adducts the hydrophobic interactions between nanotubes and acyl chains of the lipid seem to be prevailing. Electrochemical studies performed for supported model membranes containing the drug delivered in the two investigated forms revealed that the surface concentration of the drug-nanotube adduct in supported monolayers is comparable to the reported surface concentration of the free DNR incorporated into DPPTE monolayers on gold electrodes. Therefore, it may be concluded that the application of carbon nanotubes as potential DNR carrier allows for the incorporation of comparable amount of the drug into model membranes with simultaneous decrease in the negative changes in the membrane structure and organization, which is an important aspect in terms of side effects of the drug."

Infection with tubercle bacilli(TB) occurs via airborne transmission, which involves dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei on evaporated droplets that may remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents, therefore, special air handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Patients with infectious TB must be placed in a single room with negative pressure and a ventilation rate of 6 or more air changes per hour. Health care workers must wear an N95 mask when entering the room, and if an incident involving possible TB infection occurs in the hospital, the concerned people should be examined for Tuberculin reaction. Two to 12 weeks after the TB infection has occurred, the tuberculin reaction converts to positive. However, most Japanese people have been vaccinated with BCG, so assessment of the results is difficult. A comparison of the diameter of erythema before and after the potential infection may be the most confirmatory. If latent TB infection is suspected, preventive therapy with isoniazid must be considered. Special biohazard systems in the clinical laboratory and autopsy room have also been proposed to prevent TB dispersal.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who were admitted to Chi-Mei Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan, with a diagnosis of NF. The definitive diagnosis was confirmed by the surgical findings, including (1) dishwater or foul-smelling discharge, (2) presence of necrotic fascia or lack of fascial bleeding, and (3) lack of resistance of normally adherent muscular fascia to blunt dissection. To identify factors associated with mortality, variables including personal history and comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory data, and microbiological data were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors.

This CCM is induced when the CO2 concentration is at air levels or lower and is comprised of a set of proteins that allow the efficient uptake of C-i into the cell as well as its directed transport to the site where Rubisco fixes CO2 into biomolecules. While several components of the CCM have been identified in recent years, the picture is still far from complete.

The mutant collection was screened using both a published PCR-based approach (Gonzalez-Ballester et al. 2011) and a phenotypic growth screen. The PCR-based screen did not rely on a colony having an altered growth phenotype and was used to identify colonies with disruptions in genes previously identified as being associated with the CCM-related gene. Eleven independent insertional mutations were identified in eight different genes showing the usefulness of this approach in generating mutations in CCM-related genes of interest as well as identifying new CCM components. Further improvements of this method are also discussed."

GENUS","MEDYCYNA PRACY","66","1","?",NA,"Background: Microbiological contamination of the air and the acquisition of the antibiotic resistance by pathogenic bacteria is a growing phenomenon that has a substantial impact on the quality of our health. This problem applies mainly to public areas where we spend a large part of our lives. This study was focused on the microbiological analysis of the air in some kindergartens and antibiotic resistance of bacteria of the Stephylococcus spp. genus. The identification of the isolated mould fungi has been also made. Material and Methods: Air samples were collected from classrooms in the seasonal cycle in the mornings and afternoons using 2 methods, sedimentation and impact. Air samples collected outside the kindergartens served as controls. Air quality assessments were based on the groups of indicator microorganisms, according to Polish standards. The susceptibility of isolated staphylococci was assessed with the disc-diffusion method, using 8 different classes of antibiotics, in line with the recommendations of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Results: The analyses show that, regardless of the method, the total number of heterothropic bacteria and staphylococci in the air of the analyzed kindergartens exceeded the allowable limits. There was no air pollution with the fungal infection. Based on the antibiogram, it was found that Staphylococcus spp. strains showed the highest sensitivity to chloramphenicol and the lowest to penicillin and gentamicin. Among the fungi moulds of the genus Cladosporium predominated. Conclusions: The results of the analyses highlight the need for regular health checks and further research to help identify biological factors that may significantly affect the quality of health of people living in public spaces."

The synthesized composites have potent antibacterial activity toward both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The materials form good coatings on surfaces and kill both airborne and waterborne bacteria. Surfaces coated with these composites resist biofilm formation. These composites are different from other silver-containing antibacterial materials both in the ease of synthesis and in the use of a silver salt nanoparticle instead of elemental silver or complex silver compounds. We also demonstrate the ability to tune the release of biocidal Ag(+) ions from these composites by controlling the size of the embedded AgBr nanoparticles.

In this paper, to uncover the mechanism underlying the bactericidal effect of blue light, a combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric tools is employed to detect the photoreactivity of MRSA and its distinctive pathway toward apoptosis after treatment. The mechanism of action of UV light and vancomycin against MRSA is also investigated to support the findings. Principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) is employed to reveal clustering of five groups of MRSA samples, namely untreated (control I), untreated and incubated at ambient air (control II), irradiated with 470 nm blue light, irradiated with 253.5 UV light, and vancomycin-treated MRSA. Loadings plot from PCA-LDA analysis reveals important functional groups in proteins (1683, 1656, 1596, 1542 cm(-1)), lipids (1743, 1409 cm(-1)), and nucleic acids region of the spectrum (1060, 1087 cm(-1)) that are responsible for the classification of blue light irradiated spectra and control spectra. Cluster vector plots and scores plot reveals that UV light-irradiated spectra are the most biochemically similar to blue light-irradiated spectra; however, some wavenumbers experience a shift. The shifts between blue light and UV light irradiated loadings plot at nu(asym) PO2- band (from 1228 to 1238 cm(-1)), DNA backbone (from 970 to 966 cm(-1)) and base pairing vibration of DNA (from 1717 to 1712 cm(-1)) suggest distinctive changes in DNA conformation in response to irradiation. Our findings indicate that irradiation of MRSA with 470 nm light induces A-DNA cleavage and that B-DNA is more resistant to damage by blue light. Blue light and UV light treatment of MRSA are complementary and distinct from the known antimicrobial effect of vancomycin. Moreover, it is known that UV-induced cleavage of DNA predominantly targets B-DNA, which is in agreement with the FTIR findings. Overall the results suggest that the combination of light and vancomycin could be a more robust approach in treating MRSA infections"

In this work, we determine the mechanism responsible for the higher activity against Escherichia coli of the C-terminal lysine dimer of magainin 2, (MG2)2K, in comparison to the monomeric peptide magainin 2 (MG2). Langmuir monolayers and vesicles made with the E. coli lipid extract were used to address the two possible states for the peptide-membrane interaction, namely the binding state and pore state, respectively. The incorporation of MG2 and (MG2)2K in lipid monolayers at the air-water interface caused slight differences in surface pressure isotherms and polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption (PM-IRRAS) spectra, and therefore the difference in activity is not associated with the binding state. In contrast, large differences were observed in the leakage experiments where (MG2)2K was shown to disrupt the large unilamellar vesicles to a much higher extent owing to efficient pore formation. The binding and penetration of MG2 and (MG2)2K were also probed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for bilayers made with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPE:POPG). (MG2)2K forms disordered toroidal pores at a significant lower concentration than for MG2. In summary, the combination of experimental and computational simulation results indicated that the pre-assembling state of (MG2)2K dimer leads to a reduced number of molecules and shorter time being required to kill E. coli.  2018 Elsevier B.V."

Despite evidence that dried blood spots (DIBS) are suitable for HIV serology, viral load and CD4(+) T-cell enumeration, no study has evaluated DBS for HIVDR genotyping. We assessed the feasibility of genotyping HIV-1 from field-collected DBS stored under challenging environmental conditions. Methods: We prospectively collected specimens from newly diagnosed, treatment-naive HIV-positive subjects in Mexico. Whole blood was spotted onto filter cards, air dried at ambient temperature and stored with desiccant at 37 degrees C and 85\% humidity for 3 months. Genotypes obtained from DBS-extracted nucleic acids using an in-house nested reverse transcription-PCR method were compared to genotypes derived from matched plasma. Results: Genotypes from 103 phylogenetically matched plasma and DBS were compared. In total, 90.1\% of all DBS specimens could be amplified in either the region of HIV protease or the region of reverse transcriptase. Failure to amplify from DBS did not correlate with low plasma viral loads. Between paired specimens, the median nucleotide similarity was 99.95\%. In the nine specimens with drug resistance mutations, all differences between pairs were partial discordances. Mutations identified in plasma were found in the majority of replicate DBS amplifications. Conclusion: The results suggest that genotypes obtained from DBS are equivalent to those from plasma. DBS are a promising public health tool for HIVDR surveillance of treatment-naive subjects, especially in regions where specimens might be exposed to severe environmental conditions and where logistical difficulties could prevent timely specimen processing. More studies are needed to validate DBS for patient monitoring."

There is a paucity of data regarding factors that may affect TB transmission risk in household settings. We evaluated air exchange and the impact of natural ventilation on estimated TB transmission risk in traditional Zulu homes in rural South Africa. Methods: We utilized a carbon dioxide decay technique to measure ventilation in air changes per hour (ACH). We evaluated predominant home types to determine factors affecting ACH and used the Wells-Riley equation to estimate TB transmission risk. Results: Two hundred eighteen ventilation measurements were taken in 24 traditional homes. All had low ventilation at baseline when windows were closed (mean ACH = 3, SD = 3.0), with estimated TB transmission risk of 55.4\% over a ten hour period of exposure to an infectious TB patient. There was significant improvement with opening windows and door, reaching a mean ACH of 20 (SD = 13.1, p < 0.0001) resulting in significant decrease in estimated TB transmission risk to 9.6\% (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified factors predicting ACH, including ventilation conditions (windows/doors open) and window to volume ratio. Expanding ventilation increased the odds of achieving >= 12 ACH by 60-fold. Conclusions: There is high estimated risk of TB transmission in traditional homes of infectious TB patients in rural South Africa. Improving natural ventilation may decrease household TB transmission risk and, combined with other strategies, may enhance TB control efforts."

We describe the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) before and after the implementation of aggressive infection control measures at the Air Force Theater Hospital in Iraq. METHODS: All patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were followed prospectively for the development of VAP. Baseline VAP rate was determined in May 2006, and preventive measures were implemented by June 2006. Interventions included hand hygiene, contact barrier precautions, patient and staff cohorting, chlorhexidine oral care, and reducing the duration and spectrum of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis. Additionally, each ICU tent was closed periodically for cleaning and disinfection. Daily inspections provided ongoing staff education and enforcement of procedures. Monthly VAP rates were calculated and compared for trend. RESULTS: There were 475 ICU admissions from May 2006 through August 2006 for a mean admission rate of 119 per month. The rate of VAP per 1,000 ventilator days was 60.6 in May, 31.6 in June, 21.3 in July, and 11.1 in August (p = 0.029). Targeted surveillance in November and December revealed VAP rates of 11.6 and 9.7, respectively. Notably, the most common bacteria, Acinetobacter, had improved antimicrobial susceptibilities after the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of aggressive infection control procedures in a combat military hospital was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of VAP.

Among bacteria, biocide sensitivity is based on permeability of biocides through the cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria are more permeable and susceptible to biocides, whereas Gram-negative bacteria have a more complex cell wall and are the least sensitive bacteria. The present study was designed to study the effect of biocides on the cell wall of biocide-resistant bacteria. Peptidoglycan (PG), diaminopimelic acid (DAP), and teichoic acid contents of the cell wall were determined in L-broth and L-broth supplemented with biocides at different temperatures (3 degrees C and 45 degrees C) and pH levels (7 and 9). In general and Gram staining-specific comparison, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the DAP content of biocide-resistant bacteria was observed at pH 7 and at both temperatures. In tubing-specific comparison, a significant increase in the amount of teichoic acid in air water tubing (37 degrees C at pH 9) and DAP in patient tubing (pH 7 at both temperatures) was observed. In main water pipe, a significant decrease (p > 0.05) in PG content was noticed at 45 degrees C and pH 9. Overall, a significant increase in DAP content may be an important constituent in the manifestation of isolate resistance against various biocides."

They are Gram-positive, strictly aerobic bacteria. Members of the genus Nocardia are ubiquitous. They are frequently isolated from soil, water, air dusts. The mode of contamination occurs by inhalation or by cutaneous or ocular traumatic lesion. Clinically, nocardiosis is essentially characterized by pulmonary diseases. Others secondary localizations are described, such as in the central nervous system. Nocardia can be responsible for important cutaneous, subcutaneous and lymphocutaneous manifestations. In the same way, some extrapulmonary diseases and spread nocardiosis are more rarely observed. Several factors seem to favour the development of Nocardia. The immunocompromised patients, particularly those with organ transplant and the patients treated with immunosuppressor treatments, offer strong predispositions to this opportunistic disease. The nocardiosis is nevertheless observed in healthy persons. In front of polymorphic and specific-less clinical manifestations, large phenotypic heterogeneity, and resistance profiles to specific antibiotics, a correct diagnosis for Nocardia species is necessary to apply an adequate treatment. The techniques of identification based on the chemotaxonomic analysis and the susceptibility to different inhibitors are efficient for the identification of genus and species. However, because of the slow growth rate of Nocardia, the reading of these tests can require several weeks of incubation. With the intention of the rapid identification of genus and species, the molecular techniques (PCR-RFLP) seem to be efficient. The technique of RAPD allows an efficient molecular typing, which will give a better knowledge concerning transmission, ecological niches and epidemic reservoirs."

Principal coordinate analysis showed that distinct community structures were formed with each substrate type. The bacterial diversity measured as Shannon index decreased with time in acetate cycles, and was restored with the introduction of leachate. The change of diversity was accompanied by an opposite trend in the relative abundance of Geobacter-affiliated phylotypes, which were acclimated to over 40% of total Bacteria at the end of acetate-fed conditions then declined in the leachate cycles.

This study demonstrates evidence of the dose-response kinetics of airborne bacterial contamination when exposed to 405 nm light and compares bacterial susceptibility when exposed in three different media: air, liquid and surfaces. Bacterial aerosols of Staphylococcus epidermidis, generated using a 6-Jet Collison nebulizer, were introduced into an aerosol suspension chamber. Aerosolized bacteria were exposed to increasing doses of 405 nm light, and air samples were extracted from the chamber using a BioSampler liquid impinger, with viability analysed using pour-plate culture. Results have demonstrated successful aerosol inactivation, with a 99.1% reduction achieved with a 30 minute exposure to high irradiance (22 mWcm-2) 405 nm light (P=0.001). Comparison to liquid and surface exposures proved bacteria to be 3-4 times more susceptible to 405 nm light inactivation when in aerosol form. Overall, results have provided fundamental evidence of the susceptibility of bacterial aerosols to antimicrobial 405 nm light treatment, which offers benefits in terms of increased safety for human exposure, and eradication of microbes regardless of antibiotic resistance.

This modification is advantageous for both portability and convenience. Bacterial inactivation was determined within a chamber by direct quantification of colony Jing units. Plasma exposure significantly inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis following a 1-min application (p < 0.001). S. epidermidis was more susceptible to the plasma after a 5-min exposure compared to E. coli. Temperature and pH measurements taken immediately before and after plasma exposure determined neither heat nor pH changes play a role in bacterial inactivation. Because of the notable effect on S. epidermidis, the effect of plasma exposure on several isolates and strains of the related opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was quantified. While S. aureus isolates and strains were efficiently inactivated on an agar surface, subsequent testing on other clinically relevant surfaces demonstrated that the inactivation level, although significant, was reduced. This reduction appeared to depend on both the surface texture and the surface moisture content. These findings suggest this novel plasma source lacking an applied gas flow has potential application for surface bacterial decontamination. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Results are reported in categories of susceptibility: susceptible to concentrations surpassed in vivo with usual dosage, susceptible to concentrations surpassed in vivo with high dosage, and resistant to concentrations achievable in vivo. Results are compared to minimal inhibitory concentrations which were determined simultaneously by using a microdilution method in an anaerobic glove box. Twenty strains of Bacteroides fragilis, 10 strains of Fusobacterium, 20 strains of Clostridium, 10 strains of gram-positive non-sporeforming bacilli, and 30 strains of cocci grew to visible turbidity within 1 day of incubation. Of the 360 antibiotic-organism combinations tested, 98% were in a susceptibility category that corresponded (within one concentration) to the actual minimal inhibitory concentration as determined by the microdilution method. After 2 days of incubation, growth was more abundant, but results often indicated inappropriate degrees of resistance. Variation in inoculum size had little effect on results. Ten strains of B. melaninogenicus did not grow enough for susceptibility to be categorized accurately. The tube test could be used in any clinical microbiology laboratory for a limited number of susceptibility tests on anaerobic bacteria other than B. melaninogenicus without preparation of special media or purchase of special equipment."

This study examines the molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced CDR1 mRNA stability in AIR isolates. Mapping of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of CDRI revealed that it was rich in adenylate/uridylate (AU) elements, possessed heterogeneous polyadenylation sites, and had putative consensus sequences for RNA-binding proteins. Swapping of heterologous and chimeric lacZ-CDR1 3' UTR transcriptional reporter fusion constructs did not alter the reporter activity in AS and AR isolates, indicating that cis-acting sequences within the CDRI 3' UTR itself are not sufficient to confer the observed differential mRNA decay. Interestingly, the poly(A) tail of the CDRI mRNA of AIR isolates was similar to 35-50\% hyperadenylated as compared with AS isolates. C. albicans poly(A) polymerase (PAPI), responsible for mRNA adenylation, resides on chromosome 5 in close proximity to the mating type-like (MTL) locus. Two different PAPI alleles, PAP1-a/PAP1-alpha, were recovered from AS (MTL-a/MTL-alpha), while a single type of PAPI allele (PAP1-alpha.) was recovered from AR isolates (MTL-alpha/MTL-alpha). Among the heterozygous deletions of PAP1-a (Delta pap1-a/PAP1-alpha) and PAP1-alpha. (PAP1-a/Delta pap1-alpha), only the former led to relatively enhanced drug resistance, to polyadenylation and to transcript stability of CDR1 in the AS isolate. This suggests a dominant negative role of PAPI-a in CDR1 transcript polyadenylation and stability. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that loss of heterozygosity at the PAP1 locus is linked to hyperadenylation and subsequent increased stability of CDR1 transcripts, thus contributing to enhanced drug resistance."

Period 1 comprised 32 patients. All received streptomycin for five days and methicillin for seven days, starting the evening before operation. None of the patients was colonized with multiresistant (MR) strains before or immediately after operation. Two days after operation, in the intensive care unit (ICU) 79% of the patients carried MR S. epidermidis in the nose. Air analyses showed that 30% of the bacteria isolated from the ICU were MR, while such strains were seldom found in the operating theatre. Nose swabs from the staff showed that 26% at the ICU and none in the operating theatre carried MR strains. In an attempt to counteract the selection for MR strains, all patients in period 2 received methicillin alone for only 3 days, and disinfection of the ICU was then performed after each patient. Period 2 comprised 105 patients. The frequency of MR S. epidermidis in the patient material declined from 80% to 40% and from 26% to 15% in the staff members. No changes were found concerning the frequency of postoperative complications. The conclusion is that methicillin alone for three days gives as good a protection against postoperative infections as a more broad-spectrum treatment and that reduced use of antibiotics will reduce the risk of early colonization with resistant strains."

The study was conducted using E. coli strains isolated from the air, manure, and horse nostril swabs in three horse riding centers differing in the system of horse keepingstable (OJK Pegaz and KJK Szary) and free-range (SKH Nielepice). Resistance to antibiotics was determined using the disk-diffusion method, and the PCR technique was employed to detect the extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) genes, while the genetic diversity of strains was assessed by rep-PCR. A total of 200 strains were collected during the 2-year study, with the majority isolated from KJK Szary, while the smallest number was obtained from SKH Nielepice. The strains were mostly resistant to ampicillin, aztreonam, and ticarcillin. The tested strains were most frequently resistant to one or two antibiotics, with a maximum of ten antimicrobials at the same time. Two multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were detected in OJK Pegaz while in KJK Szary there were two MDR and one extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strain. The ESBL mechanism was most frequently observed in OJK Pegaz (20.31% of strains) followed by KJK Szary (15.53% of strains) and SKH Nielepice (15.15% of strains).

The rep-PCR genotyping showed high variation among the analyzed strains, whereas its degree differed between the studied facilities, indicating that the type of horse keeping (stable vs. free-range) affects the genetic diversity of the E. coli strains. Having regard to the fact that the tested strains of E. coli were derived from non-hospitalized horses that were not treated pharmacologically, we can assume that the observed antimicrobial resistance may be of bothnatural origin, i.e., not the result of the selection pressure, and acquired, the source of which could be people present in the horse riding facilities, the remaining horses which were not included in the study, and air, as well as water, fodder, and litter of the animals.

Putative prostate stem cells and prostate tumor stem cells in benign and malignant human prostate tissue, in primary human prostate xenografts, and in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model of prostate cancer, are defined by expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), a marker of pluripotent hematopoietic, muscle, and neural stem cells, and by an absence of androgen receptor (AR) protein. Inhibition of BCRP-mediated efflux of dihydrotestosterone by novobiocin or furnitremorgin C in a rat prostate progenitor cell line that expresses BCRP and AR mRNAs, but minimal AR protein, results in stabilization and nuclear translocation of AR protein, providing a mechanism for lack of AIR protein in BCRP-expressing stem cells. In both benign and malignant human prostate tissue, the rare epithelial cells that express BCRP and lack AR protein are localized in the basal cell compartment, survive androgen deprivation, and maintain proliferative potential in the hypoxic, androgen-deprived prostate. Putative prostate tumor stem cells that express BCRP but not AR protein in TRAMP are the source of a BCRP-negative and AR-negative, Foxa2- and SV40Tag-expressing, transit amplifying compartment that progresses to the poorly differentiated carcinomas that arise rapidly after castration. Therefore, BCRP expression isolates prostate stem/tumor stem cells from the prostate tissue microenvironment through constitutive efflux of androgen, protecting the putative tumor stem cells from androgen deprivation, hypoxia, or adjuvant chemotherapy, and providing the nidus for recurrent prostate cancer."

Modern operating rooms are considered to be aseptic environments. The use of surgical mask, frequent air exchanges, and architectural barriers are used to reduce airborne microbial populations. Breaks in surgical technique, host contamination, or hematogenous seeding are suggested as causal factors in these infections. This study implicates contamination of the operating room air as an additional etiology of infection. Methods. To investigate the potential sources of perioperative contamination, an innovative in situ air-sampling analysis was conducted during an 18-month period involving 70 separate vascular surgical procedures. Air-sample cultures were obtained from multiple points within the operating room, ranging from 0.5 to 4 m from the surgical wound. Selected microbial clonality was determined by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. In a separate series of studies microbial nasopharyngeal shedding was evaluated under controlled environmental conditions in the presence and absence of a surgical mask. Results. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered from 86% of air samples, 51% from within 0.5 m of the surgical wound, whereas Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 64% of air samples, 39% within 0.5 m from the wound. Anterior nares swabs were obtained from 11 members of the vascular team, clonality was observed between 8 strains of S epidermidis, and 2 strains of S aureus were recovered from selected team members and air-samples collected throughout the operating room environment. Miscellaneous Gram-negative isolates were recovered less frequently (<33%); however, 7 isolates expressed multiple patterns of antimicrobial resistance. The traditional surgical mask demonstrated limited effectiveness at curtailing microbial shedding, especially during symptomatic periods of rhinorrhea. Conclusions. Gram-positive staphylococcal isolates were frequently isolated from air samples obtained throughout the operating room, including areas adjacent to the operative field. Nasopharyngeal shedding from person participating in the operation was identified as the source of many of these airborne contaminants. Failure of the traditional surgical mask to prevent microbial shedding is likely associated with an increased risk of perioperative contamination of biomedical implants, especially in procedures lasting longer than 90 minutes.  2005 Mosby, Inc.

In the present study, we evaluated the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with chemometric techniques as a monitoring tool of exhaust air from poultry operation systems. To generate a high-quality data set for evaluation, the exhaust air of two poultry houses was sampled by applying state-of-theart filter sampling protocols. The two stables were identical except for one crucial difference, the presence or absence of an exhaust air cleaning system. In total, twenty-one exhaust air samples were collected at the two sites to monitor spectral differences caused by the cleaning device, and to followchanges in exhaust air characteristics during a fattening period. The total dust load was analyzed by gravimetric determination and included as a response variable in multivariate data analysis. The filter samples were directly measured with NIR spectroscopy. Principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and factor analysis (FA) were effective in classifying the NIR exhaust air spectra according to fattening day and origin. The results indicate that the dust load and the composition of exhaust air (inorganic or organic matter) substantially influence the NIR spectral patterns. In conclusion, NIR spectroscopy as a tool is a promising and very rapidway to detect differences between exhaust air samples based on still not clearly defined circumstances triggered during a fattening period and the availability of an exhaust air cleaning system.

Depending on the order of inoculation, a difference in transfer efficiency between the biofilm models could be found. The ease by which the multiresistance plasmid was transferred highlights the importance of biofilms in the food industry as hot spots for the acquisition of multiresistance plasmids.

Radiation sensitivity of S. typhimurium was greater in the presence of air than in the presence of N-2 gas (radiation doses required to inactivate 90\% of the cells, 0.394 +/- 0.029 in air and 0.561 +/- 0.035 in N-2), Recovery of the covalently closed circular form of plasmid pBR322 from S. typhimurium transformants (Amp(r) Tet(r)) was decreased by irradiation but not by heating, Heating prior to irradiation significantly decreased the recovery of plasmid DNA without affecting survival of S. typhimurium. Transformability of the recovered plasmid pBR322 was affected by neither irradiation nor heating, and mutation of antibiotic resistance genes was not detected in S. typhimurium.

The whooping cough agent, Bordetella pertussis, adheres to ciliated cells of the human airway epithelium and subverts its defense functions through the action of secreted toxins and other virulence factors. We examined the impact of B. pertussis infection and of adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA) action on the functional integrity of human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). B. pertussis adhesion to the apical surface of polarized pseudostratified VA10 cell layers provoked a disruption of tight junctions and caused a drop in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The reduction of TEER depended on the capacity of the secreted CyaA toxin to elicit cAMP signaling in epithelial cells through its adenylyl cyclase enzyme activity. Both purified CyaA and cAMP-signaling drugs triggered a decrease in the TEER of VA10 cell layers. Toxin-produced cAMP signaling caused actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and induced mucin 5AC production and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, while it inhibited the IL-17A-induced secretion of the IL-8 chemokine and of the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 2. These results indicate that CyaA toxin activity compromises the barrier and innate immune functions of Bordetella-infected airway epithelia."

The sensitivity of the strains to a range of antibiotics was determined by the agar diffuse method. Industrial strains responded differently to test antibiotics. Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria of the genus Bacillus are most sensitive to antibiotics; the representatives of the genus Rhodococcus are moderately sensitive and the gram-negative bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas and Alcaligenes are resistant to a large number of basic antibiotics and new-generation ones. The findings were made to serve as the basis for developing selective microbiological assays for environment quality control (the air of populated areas or a working zone), which were legally adopted."

Rooted in inadequate TB treatment and compounded by a vicious circle of diagnostic delay and improper treatment, MDR-TB/XDR-TB has become a global epidemic that is fuelled by poverty, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and neglect of airborne infection control. The majority of MDR-TB cases in some settings with high prevalence of MDR-TB are due to transmission of drug-resistant bacillary strains to previously untreated patients. Global efforts in controlling MDR-TB/XDR-TB can no longer focus solely on high-risk patients. It is difficult and costly to treat MDR-TB/XDRTB. Without timely implementation of preventive and management strategies, difficult MDR-TB/XDR-TB can cripple global TB control efforts. Preventive strategies include prompt diagnosis with adequate TB treatment using the directly observed therapy, short-course (DOTS) strategy and drug-resistance programmes, airborne infection control, preventive treatment of TB/HIV, and optimal use of antiretroviral therapy. Management strategies for established cases of difficult MDR-TB/XDR-TB rely on harnessing existing drugs (notably newer generation fluoroquinolones, high-dose isoniazid, linezolid and pyrazinamide with in vitro activity) in the best combinations and dosing schedules, together with adjunctive surgery in carefully selected cases. Immunotherapy may also have a role in the future. New diagnostics, drugs and vaccines are required to meet the challenge, but science alone is insufficient.

Olive oil samples were studied from both areas during 2014 and 2015. The soil microbiological status of the polluted and unpolluted orchards has been characterized and the antimicrobial effects of olive oils extracted from polluted plants (PP) and control plants (CP) against some phytopathogens have been explored. Results showed that the antibacterial activity of PP oil was significantly higher than CP and this could be due to the high content of some phenolic compounds elicited by air and soil Zn pollution (especially in the layer 0-20cm). There is no detectable antifungal activity of the studied oils. The metabolic activity (both total and for each carbon substrate group), diversity and evenness of PP soil bacterial communities were significantly different from CP soil, while the effects of soil depth was negligible. The same parameters measured on soil fungal communities are lower in PP soil at 0-20cm soil depth. The current research clarified the impact of atmospheric Zn pollution on the antimicrobial activity of olive oil and the soil microbial metabolic profiles. The bioactive substances extracted from olive oils growing in Zn-polluted area might be used as antibiotics."

When it comes to disinfection, individual parts of electronic equipment of angiology diagnostics such as patient couches of computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners prove to be very hard to disinfect. Disinfectants of choice are therefore expected to possess properties such as rapid, residue-free action without any damaging effect on the sensitive electronic equipment. This paper discusses the use of the neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW) as a biocide for the disinfection of diagnostic rooms and equipment. METHODS: The CT and MRI rooms were aerosolized with EOW using aerosolization device. The presence of micro-organisms before and after the aerosolization was recorded with the help of sedimentation and cyclone air sampling. Total body count (TBC) was evaluated in absolute and log values. RESULTS: The number of micro-organisms in hospital rooms was low as expected. Nevertheless, a possible TBC reduction between 78.99-92.50% or 50.50-70.60% in log values was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The research has shown that the use of EOW for the air and hard surface disinfection can considerably reduce the presence of micro-organisms and consequently the possibility of hospital infections. It has also demonstrated that the sedimentation procedure is insufficient for the TBC determination. The use of Biocide aerosolization proved to be efficient and safe in all applied ways. Also, no eventual damage to exposed devices or staff was recorded."

Therefore, prevention of respiratory infections is an important goal for public health interventions. In this context, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) represent an interesting perspective for research and development by virtue of their favorable antimicrobial activity against many respiratory pathogens. One of the latest innovations in the biotech field discussed in this review is the creation of a biocompatible, biogel-based nasal filter enriched with AgNPs. Compared to traditional personal protective equipment (PPE), this type of nasal filter has the advantage of combining the antibacterial and antiviral activity of AgNPs with the common filtration capacity shared by other PPEs. This dual mechanism means that AgNP-enriched nasal filters serve to reduce the infecting microbial-load and protect the lower airways, without interfering with the normal respiratory capacity (airflow-resistance <5%). Given their antimicrobial characteristics and performance, AgNP-enriched nasal filters can meet many community and occupational currently unmet needs in the prevention of airborne infectious diseases, by ensuring an excellent respiratory-comfort and a continuous day-use."

AIM: To review the antimicrobial properties of 405 nm light and to describe its application as an environmental decontamination technology with particular reference to disinfection of the hospital environment. METHODS: Extensive literature searches for relevant scientific papers and reports. FINDINGS: A large body of scientific evidence is now available that provides underpinning knowledge of the 405 nm light-induced photodynamic inactivation process involved in the destruction of a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial species, including resistant forms such as bacterial and fungal spores. For practical application, a high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental disinfection system (HINS-light EDS) has been developed and tested in hospital isolation rooms. The trial results have demonstrated that this 405 nm light system can provide continuous disinfection of air and exposed surfaces in occupied areas of the hospital, thereby substantially enhancing standard cleaning and infection control procedures. CONCLUSION: Violet-blue light, particularly 405 nm light, has significant antimicrobial properties against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens and, although germicidal efficacy is lower than UV light, this limitation is offset by its facility for safe, continuous use in occupied environments. Promising results on disinfection efficacy have been obtained in hospital trials but the full impact of this technology on reduction of healthcare-associated infection has yet to be determined."

Acute exposure to Cl(2) induces severe epithelial damage, airway hyperreactivity, impaired alveolar fluid clearance, and pulmonary edema in the presence of heightened inflammation and significant neutrophil accumulation in the lungs. Herein, we investigated whether Cl(2) exposure affected the lung antimicrobial immune response leading to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Mice exposed to Cl(2) and challenged intratracheally 24 h thereafter with the opportunistic mold Aspergillus fumigatus demonstrated an >500-fold increase in A. fumigatus lung burden 72 h postchallenge compared with A. fumigatus mice exposed to room air. Cl(2)-exposed A. fumigatus challenged mice also demonstrated significantly higher lung resistance following methacholine challenge and increased levels of plasma proteins (albumin and IgG) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Despite enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lungs of Cl(2)-exposed A. fumigatus challenged mice, these cells (>60% of which were neutrophils) demonstrated a profound impairment in generating superoxide. Significantly higher A. fumigatus burden in the lungs of Cl(2) exposed mice correlated with enhanced production of IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL1, CCL2, and CCL3. Surprisingly, however, Cl(2)-exposed A. fumigatus challenged mice had a specific impairment in the production of IL-17A and IL-22 in the lungs compared with mice exposed to room air and challenged with A. fumigatus. In summary, our results indicate that Cl(2) exposure markedly impairs the antimicrobial activity and inflammatory reactivity of myeloid cells in the lung leading to increased susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens."

In addition, all possible pairs of the disinfectants were tested in order to compare the effect of the combination and its components. METHODOLOGY: Filter paper discs were immersed in standardized yeast suspensions and then transferred to disinfectant solutions of different concentrations and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 s, 5 min, 1 h and 24 h. After incubation the filter paper discs were transferred to vials with PBS and glass beads that were then vigorously shaken for dispersal of the yeast cells. PBS with resuspended yeasts was serially diluted 10-fold. Droplets of 25 microL from each dilution were inoculated on TSB agar plates and incubated in air at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The number of colony-forming units was then calculated from appropriate dilutions. RESULTS: C. albicans cells were highly resistant to calcium hydroxide. Sodium hypochlorite (5% and 0.5%) and iodine (2%) potassium iodide (4%) killed all yeast cells within 30 s, whilst chlorhexidine acetate (0.5%) showed complete killing after 5 min. Combinations of disinfectants were equally or less effective than the more effective component. All C. albicans strains tested showed similar susceptibility to the medicaments tested. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that sodium hypochlorite, iodine potassium iodide and chlorhexidine acetate are more effective than calcium hydroxide against C. albicans in vitro. However, combining calcium hydroxide with sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine may provide a wide-spectrum antimicrobial preparation with a long-lasting effect."

When large numbers of these bacilli have grown intracellularly within such macrophages, a cytotoxic immune response, herein called tissue-damaging (or necrotizing) delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), kills the macrophages (and usually some of the surrounding tissue), forming the caseous center of the developing tubercle. In solid caseum, tubercle bacilli may survive, but do not multiply. When bacilli escape from the edge of the caseum, they are rapidly ingested by nearby viable macrophages. If these macrophages have not been activated, the bacilli again multiply intracellularly, and the cytotoxic immune response kills the bacilli-laden macrophages (and surrounding tissue), thus enlarging the caseous center. In hosts that develop poor activation of macrophages, this process is repeated until much of the lung is destroyed. In hosts that can develop good activation of macrophages (by cytokines from antigen-specific T cells), herein called cell-mediated immunity (CMI), the caseous centers become surrounded by these activated macrophages, which ingest and destroy the bacilli escaping from the caseum. This process can arrest the disease. Unfortunately, the caseous center may liquefy in such resistant hosts. In the liquefied menstruum, the bacilli may grow extracellularly (for the first time during the course of the disease), reaching tremendous numbers. The cytotoxic immune response to these numerous bacilli and their tuberculin-like products causes much tissue necrosis, including erosion of the walls of small bronchi, which results in cavity formation. From such cavities, the bacilli spread to other parts of the lung and to the environment. The extracellular multiplication of tubercle bacilli in the liquefied caseum is the main reason why tuberculosis perpetuates itself in mankind. It is also the reason why antimicrobial drug-resistant bacillary strains develop. To elucidate the various mechanisms involved in macrophage activation, caseation, and liquefaction is a major challenge for tuberculosis researchers today."

Peri-urban ecosystems serve at the symbiotic interface between urban and rural ecosystems, and investigations into the dissemination of ARGs in peri-urban areas provide a basic framework for tracking the spread of ARGs and potential mitigations. In this study, through the use of high-throughput quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing, seasonal and geographical distributions of ARGs and their host bacterial communities were characterized in a peri-urban river. The abundance of ARGs in downstream was 5.2-33.9 times higher than upstream, which indicated distinct antibiotic resistance pollution in the areas where human lives. With the comparison classified based on land use nearby, the abundance of ARGs in samples near farmland and villages was higher than in the background (3.47-5.58 times), pointing to the high load in the river caused by farming and other human activities in the peri-urban areas. With the co-occurrence pattern revealed by network analysis, blaVEB and tetM were proposed to be indicators of ARGs which get together in the same module. Furthermore, seasonal variations in ARGs and the transport of bacterial communities were observed. The effects of seasonal temperature on the dissemination of ARGs along the watershed was also evaluated. The highest absolute abundance of ARGs occurred in summer (2.81x10(9)copies/L on average), the trends of ARG abundances in four seasons were similar with local air temperature. The Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) suggested that nine bacterial genera were implicated as biomarkers for the corresponding season. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) showed significant positive correlation with ARGs (P<0.01) and MGEs were also identified as the key-contributing factor driving ARG alteration.

Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases implicated in virulence and drug resistance in several parasitic protozoa, able to protect from nitroxidative stress and repair oxidatively damaged molecules. GiPrx1a and a truncated form of GiPrx1b (deltaGiPrx1b) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and functionally characterized. Both Prxs effectively metabolize H2O2 and alkyl-hydroperoxides (cumyl-and tert-butyl-hydroperoxide) in the presence of NADPH and E. coli thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin as the reducing system. Stopped-flow experiments show that both proteins in the reduced state react with ONOO- rapidly (k=4 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) and 2 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) at 4 degrees C, for GiPrx1a and deltaGiPrx1b, respectively). Consistent with a protective role against oxidative stress, expression of GiPrx1a (but not deltaGiPrx1b) is induced in parasitic cells exposed to air O-2 for 24 h. Based on these results, GiPrx1a and deltaGiPrx1b are suggested to play an important role in the antioxidant defense of Giardia, possibly contributing to pathogenesis."

In this chapter, we describe the in vivo reversal of the classical MDR1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype by shRNA. For local intratumoral delivery of naked shRNA-encoding vector constructs, the nonviral jet-injection was used. This jet-injector system uses compressed air to inject small volumes (5-10 muL) of naked nucleic acid solutions into tumor tissues. Furthermore, the design of the jet-injector allows multiple injections. Under our experimental design, the delivery of plasmid DNA encoding anti-MDR shRNA by jet-injection into human MDR1/P-gp overexpressing MaTu/ADR breast cancer xenografts resulted in a decrease of MDR1 mRNA expression level to more than 90%. Accordingly, the corresponding MDR1/P-gp protein is no longer detectable in the tumors after anti-MDR1 shRNA vector injection. Furthermore, combination of two intratumoral jet-injections of anti-MDR1 shRNA vectors with two intravenous administrations of doxorubicin is sufficient for a complete reversal of the MDR phenotype in association with tumor growth inhibition."

The activated species, presumed to be an isonicotinoyl radical, couples to NAD(+)/NADH forming an isoniazid-NADH adduct that ultimately confers anti-tubercular activity. To better understand the mechanisms of isoniazid activation as well as the origins of KatG-derived INH-resistance, we have compared the catalytic properties (including the ability to form the INH-NADH adduct) of the wild-type enzyme to 23 KatG mutants which have been associated with isoniazid resistance in clinical M. tuberculosis, isolates. Neither catalase nor peroxidase activities, the two inherent enzymatic functions of KatG were found to correlate with isoniazid resistance. Furthermore, catalase function was lost in mutants which lacked the Met-Tyr-Trp crosslink, the biogenic cofactor in KatG which has been previously shown to be integral to this activity. The presence or absence of the crosslink itself, however, was also found to not correlate with INH resistance. The KatG resistance-conferring mutants were then assayed for their ability to generate the INH-NADH adduct in the presence of peroxide (t-BuOOH and H(2)O(2) superoxide, and no exogenous oxidant (air-only background control). The results demonstrate that residue location plays a critical role in determining INH-resistance mechanisms associated with INH activation; however, different mutations at the same location can produce vastly different reactivities that are oxidant-specific. Furthermore, the data can be interpreted to suggest the presence of a second mechanism of INH-resistance that is not correlated with the formation of the INH-NADH adduct."

Listeria spp. were isolated from beef carcasses (2.0\%), knives (3.7\%), cutting table surfaces (1.9\%), beef (0.7\%), and water (1.3\%). The identified species were Listeria monocytogenes (0.1\%), Listeria innocua (0.9\%), and Listeria ivanovii (0.4\%). Most of the Listeria spp. were susceptible to majority of the antibiotics tested. The virulence genes were not detected in Listeria spp. However, all the L. innocua isolates were found to harbor the iap gene. The overall occurrence of S. aureus in slaughterhouses was 50.8\%. The highest occurrence was observed on hands of abattoir workers (79.6\%) and beef carcasses (59.9\%). The isolates were commonly resistant to penicillin (38.0\%), followed by ceftriaxone (31.9\%), ampicillin (29.0\%), amoxicillin (28.8\%), tetracycline (24.4\%), and chloramphenicol (23.9\%). Overall, 53.0\% of S. aureus isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotics. Vancomycin and methicillin resistance were observed in 8.5\% and 5.4\% of S. aureus isolates, respectively. Eight methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were found to harbor the mecA gene. In conclusion, Listeria spp. was only rarely found in the slaughterhouse environment and on beef. Nevertheless, the recovery of L. monocytogenes from a water reservoir containing sea water that was used to wash carcasses indicates the potential risk of contamination of the carcasses with L. monocytogenes when using sea water. S. aureus was frequently isolated from abattoir workers and beef carcasses, and the occurrence of S. aureus differed significantly between slaughterhouses. The high occurrence of S. aureus, which were often resistant toward different antibiotics, represents a significant public health concern."

We aimed to evaluate the incidence of MRB in patients treated in foreign hospitals and repatriated by international inter-hospital air transport in order to better manage these patients and adjust our procedures. Methods The records from all consecutive aeromedical evacuations and overseas repatriations carried out by Mondial Assistance France between December 2010 and November 2011 were reviewed for this study. Only inter-hospital transfers with inpatient destination of an acute care unit were considered. Patients were allocated to one of two groups: those identified as MRB carriers at their arrival in France and those who were not identified as such (either negative for MRB or not tested). Data were compared between the two groups. Results Analysis was performed on 223 patients: 16 patients (7\%) were identified as MRB carriers. Compared with confirmed non-MRB patients, MRB carriers came more frequently from a high-risk unit (88\% vs 59\%, p?=?0.05) and had a longer foreign hospital stay {[}13 (320) vs 8 (614)?d, p?=?0.01]. Conclusions The occurrence of MRB among patients repatriated from foreign hospitals is noted in a significant minority of such individuals transferred back to their home country. The typical MRB patient was admitted to a high-risk unit in a foreign hospital prior to repatriation with longer foreign hospital admissions. The prospective identification of these patients prior to transport is difficult. While these factors are associated with MRB presence, their absence does not rule out highly resistant bacterial colonization. A systematic review of this important medical issue is warranted with the development of guidelines."

Ozone, a common air pollutant, is a nonallergic asthma trigger. Importantly, ozone-induced decrements in lung function are greater in obese and overweight human subjects than in lean individuals. Obese mice also exhibit exaggerated pulmonary responses to ozone. Ozone causes greater increases in pulmonary resistance, in bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils, and in airway hyperresponsiveness in obese than in lean mice. Our data indicate that IL-33 plays a role in mediating these events. Ozone causes greater release of IL-33 into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in obese than in lean mice. Furthermore, an antibody blocking the IL-33 receptor, ST2, attenuates ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in obese but not in lean mice. Our data also indicate a complex role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in obesity-related effects on the response to ozone. In obese mice, genetic deficiency in either TNF-alpha or TNF-alpha receptor 2 augments ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas TNF-alpha receptor 2 deficiency virtually abolishes ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in lean mice. Finally, obesity is known to alter the gut microbiome. In female mice, antibiotics attenuate obesity-related increases in the effect of ozone on airway hyperresponsiveness, possibly by altering microbial production of short-chain fatty acids. Asthma control is often difficult to achieve in obese patients with asthma. Our data suggest that therapeutics directed against IL-33 may ultimately prove effective in these patients. The data also suggest that dietary manipulations and other strategies (prebiotics, probiotics) that alter the microbiome and/or its metabolic products may represent a new frontier for treating asthma in obese individuals."

The past decade has seen a significant increase in overall survival of HSCT recipients. Two of the major factors responsible for this improved outcome have been early diagnosis and preemptive therapy of CMV infection and the ability to prevent some fungal pathogens with fluconazole prophylaxis. Despite these significant successes, natural selection keeps providing the transplant team and HSCT recipient new infectious disease challenges. Transplant approaches must be developed that can provide improved primary disease control and at the same time preserve immune function. Until that time comes, transplant teams must remain vigilant about infection risks, implement all reasonable prevention measures, and remain aware of both the commonly recognized infectious pathogens and the new pathogens or antimicrobial-resistant organisms that may evolve as a consequence of the use of antimicrobial agents. We would like to emphasize the importance of basic infectious principles that have been lumped in the past under the umbrella of ""standard infection control measures."" These include but are not limited to hand washing, providing clean air and water to our patients, and isolation of patients known to be colonized with pathogens that are unusually virulent, resistant to antimicrobial therapy, and/or easily spread among patients and health care workers.

These time-honored aspects of care for the HSCT recipient will likely never go out of style, but at the same time, frame the challenge summarized by the statement, ""Where there is immune dysfunction there will continue to be increased risk of infectious complications that will need to be addressed""."

Nevertheless, it is challenging for farmers to perform this reduction without negatively affecting technical and economic performance. As an alternative, improved management practices based on biosecurity and vaccinations have been proven useful to reduce antimicrobial use without lowering productivity, but issues with insufficient experimental design possibilities have hindered economic analysis. In the present study a quasi-experimental approach was used for assessing the economic impact of reduction of antimicrobial use coupled with improved management strategies, particularly biosecurity strategies. The research was performed on farrow-to-finish pig farms in Flanders (northern region of Belgium). First, to account for technological progress and to avoid selection bias, propensity score analysis was used to compare data on technical parameters. The treatment group (n = 48) participated in an intervention study whose aim was to improve management practices to reduce the need for use of antimicrobials. Before and after the change in management, data were collected on the technical parameters, biosecurity status, antimicrobial use, and vaccinations. Treated farms were matched without replacement with control farms (n = 69), obtained from the Farm Accountancy Data Network, to estimate the difference in differences (DID) of the technical parameters. Second, the technical parameters' DID, together with the estimated costs of the management intervention and the price volatility of the feed, meat of the finisher pigs, and piglets served as a basis for modelling the profit of 11 virtual farrow-to-finish pig farms representative of the Flemish sector. Costs incurred by new biosecurity measures (median +(sic)3.96/sow/year), and new vaccinations (median (sic)0.00/sow/year) did not exceed the cost reduction achieved by lowering the use of antimicrobials (median -(sic)7.68/sow/year). No negative effect on technical parameters was observed and mortality of the finishers was significantly reduced by -1.1\%. Even after a substantial reduction of the antimicrobial treatments, the difference of the enterprise profit increased by +(sic)2.67/finisher pig/year after implementing the interventions. This result proved to be robust after stochastic modelling of input and output price volatility. The results of this study can be used by veterinarians and other stakeholders to incentivise managers of farrow-to-finish operations to use biosecurity practices as a cost-effective way to reduce antimicrobial use.

The photocatalytic properties were verified with the degradation of ethanol by gas chromatography measurements. The destruction of the bacterial cell wall component was examined with transmission electron microscope. The antibacterial effect of the photocatalyst/polymer nanohybrid films was tested with different methods and with the associated standard ISO 27447:2009. With the photoreactive coatings, an extensive disinfectant film was developed and successfully prepared. The cell wall component of S. aureus was degraded after 1 h of illumination. The antibacterial effect of the nanohybrid films has been proven by measuring the decrease of the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus on the surface and in the air as the function of illumination time. The photocatalyst/polymer nanohybrid films could inactivate 99.9 % of the investigated bacteria on different thin films after 2 h of illumination with visible light source. The reactive light source with the inner-coated photocatalyst could kill 96 % of naturally occurring airborne microorganisms after 48 h of visible light illumination in indoor air sample. The TEM results and the microbiological measurements were completed with toxicity tests carried out with Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence bacterium."

The closed landfill would be the main source of the observed bacteria concentration at the sanitary landfill. The rice field sampling site was fully covered by rice grain with wetted conditions before harvest and had no significant contribution to the airborne bacteria concentration. This might occur because the dry conditions favor suspension of soil particles and this area had limited personnel and vehicle flow.

The aerial parts of the plant were collected from Alvand mountainside (Hamadan, Iran) in May 2005 and identified by Hamadan Natural Sources Organization. The air-dried plant materials were ground to fine powder and then extracted by soxhelet apparatus using methanol. The extract was tested at a concentration of 100 mg/ml against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the disk diffusion technique. This methanolic extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE) and Micrococcus luteus, and produced inhibition zones with 8-16 mm diameters. However, it showed no activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella spp. Minimum concentrations (MC) of the extract forming a clear zone were determined against susceptible bacteria. MC 90 of the extract against 10 MRSA strains tested was 1.56 mg/ml, indicating its good activity against this important nosocomial pathogen. T. pubescens seems to be a good candidate for further phythochemical studies in an attempt to find new chemical entities combating resistant bacteria."

Complex interactions between the environment, microbes, and host are thought to lead to the development of this multifactorial disease. Understanding of the microbiology of chronic otitis media is important for efficient and effective treatment, and prevention of complications and antibiotic resistance. Thus, the study was conducted with the aim to determine the bacteriological agents implicated in discharging ears of the patients of CSOM and to determine the associated clinco-epidemiological factors among the patients of CSOM. MATERIALS AND METHODS This hospital-based descriptive study was conducted in 100 patients attending the ENT OPD in Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Medical College, Barpeta, Assam from July 2016 to June 2017. Detailed clinical history and demographic data were collected and analysed. Ear discharge was collected and microbiological profile was evaluated. RESULTS One hundred patients after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen for the study. 31-40 years age group was most commonly involved with male preponderance. Microbiological analysis of ear discharge showed that Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 76\% and Gram-positive bacteria were found in 34\% cases. Gram-negative bacteria included Pseudomonas aeruginosa 24\%, Klebsiella spp. 19\%, Proteus spp. 12\% and Escherichia coli 10\%. The Gram-positive aerobes identified included Staphylococcus spp. 15\%. The most common anaerobes identified were Bacteroides spp. in 1\%, Peptostreptococcus spp. in 1\% cases. Fungal growth was seen in 5\% cases. Diphtheroids were seen in 3\% cases. CONCLUSION Continuous and periodic evaluation of microbiological pattern and antibiotic sensitivity of isolates is necessary to decrease the potential risk of complications by early institution of appropriate treatment. Our study emphasised the need of proper identification of microbiological profile of the cases of CSOM in order to facilitate early institution of proper treatment."

The disk-diffusion tests showed that the collected isolates were most frequently resistant to erythromycin. The PCR technique was employed to search for genes conferring the resistance in staphylococci to antibiotics from the group of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins. The analyzed Staphylococcus isolates possessed simultaneously 4 different resistance genes. The molecular analysis with the use of specific primers allowed to determine the most prevalent gene which is mphC, responsible for the resistance to macrolides and for the enzymatic inactivation of the drug by phosphotransferase. The second most often detected gene was msrA1, which confers the resistance of staphylococci to macrolides and is responsible for active pumping of antimicrobial particles out of bacterial cells.  2017, The Author(s)."

However, there is no strong evidence of an increased incidence of typical nosocomial infections (i.e., ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection and catheter-associated urinary tract infections). The prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms may decrease after extensive flooding, due to repeated and thorough environmental cleaning prior to re-opening hospitals. Contamination of hospital water sources by enteric Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Aeromonas species), Legionella species and nontuberculous Mycobacterium species in flood-affected hospitals has been reported. Surveillance is an important initial step to detect potential outbreaks/pseudo-outbreaks of HAIs. Hospital preparedness policies before extensive flooding, particularly with environmental cleaning and mold remediation, are key to reducing the risk of flood-related HAIs. These policies are still lacking in most hospitals in countries that have experienced or are at risk for extensive flooding, which argues for nationwide policies to strengthen preparedness planning.SummaryAdditional studies are needed to evaluate the epidemiology of flood-related HAIs and the optimal surveillance and control methods following extensive flooding."

The reactor consisted of biofilms grown on diatomaceous earth pellets or glass beads, and was sequenced between growth cycle, in which methane and air were fed in a gas phase, and degradation cycle, in which the column was completely liquid-filled. Biomass loading on the support media was only 10 mg cell dry weight/g support media, giving a calculated biofilm thickness of 0.04 cm. Apparent pseudo-first order degradation rate constants in the system were improved by more than an order of magnitude, from 0.008 l/mg d to 0.1 l/mg d, through the use of antibiotic-resistant strains of copper-resistant organisms that express only the soluble methane monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for trichloroethylene degradation. Also, biomass accumulation was improved through the use of a cationic coagulating polymer. However, TCE degradation was sustained only for sort times, and cycling back to growth mode did not completely regenerate TCE degradation ability. Thus, biofilms of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b did not give rise to sustained high degradation rates. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd"

The antimicrobial activities of essential oils of Agronis fragrans, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Lavandula angustifolia, Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), Melaleuca nesophila (honey myrtle), Pelargonium x asperum (geranium), Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), Thymus serpyllum, and Thymus vulgaris were evaluated against an array of environmental-borne pathogenic bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria included Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus; four Gram-negative bacteria covered Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, eleven isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and a multidrug-resistant A. baumanii were incorporated. In agar disc diffusion tests, cinnamon had shown the strongest activity that could inhibit all pathogens, followed by lemon thyme, honey myrtle and lavender, while pachouli exhibited the weakest inhibition. Though fragonia possessed a broad range of activity against all pathogens, it did not inhibit some of the MRSA isolates. Cinnamon and lemon thyme demonstrated strong activity measured by minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations. In disk volatilization assay, thyme oil demonstrated the greatest inhibition, followed by lemon thyme, while no inhibition from patchouli was observed. Subsequently, the composition of the atmosphere generated by three different oil blends in our invented portable air-conditioning prototype was assessed. The results showed that mixture of oil blend No. 2 can produce good synergistic effect in reducing the prevalence of airborne pathogens, and thus preventing the spreading of infections."

The results suggested that the imide and amide groups of DMH have very similar reactivities toward the isocyanate groups on PU surfaces activated with HDI.

The antimicrobial and biofilm controlling effects were stable for longer than 6 months under normal storage in open air. Furthermore, if the functions were lost due to prolonged use they could be recharged by another chlorination treatment.

In this review, recent information is reexamined for six areas of current interest. These areas are complement activation, immune response, anaphylactic reactions, coagulation, and cerebral dysfunction. Complement may be activated by either the classical or alternate pathway during cardiopulmonary bypass and protamine administration. Membrane oxygenators appear to diminish the degree of complement activation. Complement is a major factor in the whole body inflammatory response; which often accompanies cardiopulmonary bypass. A product of complement activation, C5a- desArg, causes activation and aggregation of granulocytes. Other products of complement activation lead to lysis of blood cells including granulocytes and red cells. Bubble oxygenators appear to have a distinct disadvantage compared to membrane oxygenators regarding infection. Airborne microorganisms are more likely to be entrained into circulating blood with bubble oxygenators than with membrane oxygenators. Bubble oxygenators cause a greater decrease in leukocyte number and function than membrane oxygenators. Anaphylactic reactions have been associated with use of antibiotics, blood products, protamine, and volume expanders during cardiopulmonary bypass. Protamine reactions may be on an immunological basis or due to direct toxicity of the drug. Free radicals including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical may be generated during cardiopulmonary bypass and reperfusion. Free radical scavengers including; vitamin E, coenzyme Q, vitamin C, mannitol, and glutathione have been studied. The avoidance of blood transfusion because of risk of transmitted infection including AIDS has become a major goal in cardiac surgery. Factors that correlate with increased transfusion requirement include low hematocrit, female gender, increased age, small body size, low ejection fraction, reoperation, and emergency operation. Heparin resistance due to antithrombin III deficiency is being recognized more commonly. Antithrombin III deficiency may be corrected with fresh frozen plasma. Patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia may be difficult to manage. Several management protocols are suggested. The most straightforward appears to be the use of aspirin preoperatively and platelet transfusions postoperatively. The incidence of cerebral dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass depends on the sensitivity of the test or indicator used. Perioperative stroke is associated with intrinsic cerebrovascular disease and atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta. Retinal angiograms during cardiopulmonary bypass show that microemboli are very common. Cerebroplegia has been shown to extend the period of safe circulatory arrest in animals. Much of the new knowledge concerning cardiopulmonary bypass is the result of close collaboration between cardiac surgeons and nonsurgical scientists."

The present study compares the expression of this efflux pump in optimized in vitro models based on the human RPMI 2650 cell line with specimens of human turbinate mucosa. The presence of the ABCB1 gene was investigated at the mRNA and protein levels using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in differently cultured RPMI 2650 cells and excised human nasal epithelium. Furthermore, the localization and activity of P-gp was examined by immunohistochemical staining and functionality assays using different substrates in both in vitro and ex vivo models. Both mRNA and protein expression of P-gp was found in all studied models. Furthermore, transporter functionality was detected in both RPMI 2650 cell culture models and excised human mucosa. The results demonstrated a highly promising comparability between RPMI 2650 models and explants of human nasal tissue concerning the influence of MDR1 on drug disposition.

Impedance curves obtained for P. aeruginosa PA14 wild type and mutant strains with a transposon insertion in pqsA and pelA genes exhibited distinct phases.

We find that 2,3-butanedione and glyoxylic acid mediate global changes in gene expression related to motility and antibiotic resistance. Volatile organic compound-dependent phenotypes are conserved among bacteria and are regulated by the previously uncharacterized ypdB gene product through the downstream transcription factors soxS, rpoS or yjhU.

Relationships among characteristics of both the housing and residents and airborne microbial concentrations were evaluated. Data from air samples, nasal swabs and a medical and behavioral questionnaire from 25 residences in the city of Philadelphia in 2011 were analyzed. It was determined that Staphylococcus species with methicillin-resistance were present in the air of studied homes. Findings suggest that residential air may be a source of multiple Staphylococcus species, some of which are resistant to antibiotics."

However, factors relating to this scintigraphic finding are not well understood. The presence of hypoxic tumour cells is one of the major reasons for therapeutic failure; consequently, we attempted to determine whether oxygenation status affects Tc-99m-MIBI accumulation in tumour cells. LS180 human colon cancer and T24 human bladder cancer cells were incubated in air or N-2 gas at 37degreesC. Cellular uptake of Tc-99m-MIBI was subsequently determined at 15, 60 and 120 min. Uptake of thallium-201 chloride was also assessed. Uptake of Tc-99m-HL91 was assessed as a hypoxic marker. Accumulation of the tracers in LS180 xenografts was observed in mice treated with 5 mg/kg hydralazine and compared with that in untreated mice. pO(2) in the medium and tumours was measured with O-2 microelectrodes. N-2 gas flow gradually reduced pO(2) in the cell suspension to 1-2 mmHg in 60 min. Cellular uptake of Tc-99m-MIBI in LS180 cells decreased by approximately 30\% in N-2 gas in comparison to that in air throughout the study. Hypoxia had a more prominent influence on Tl-201 uptake, which displayed a reduction of approximately 60\% in N-2 gas at 120 min, than on Tc-99m-MIBI uptake. On the other hand, N-2 gas induced an increase of 170\% in Tc-99m-HL91 uptake at 120 min, indicating the hypoxic condition of cells. The results of in vitro assays employing the T24 cell line were similar to those obtained with the LS180 cell line. Hydralazine treatment markedly reduced Tc-99m-MIBI and Tl-201 accumulation in LS180 xenografts; moreover, intratumoural pO(2) decreased from 14.5 +/- 6.6 mmHg to 7.6 +/- 6.2 mmHg Tc-99m-HL91 accurnulation in xenografts was markedly increased by hydralazine. In conclusion, hypoxia reduced accumulation of Tc-99m-MIBI and Tl-201 in tumour cells. Accordingly, hypoxia may be an important factor in terms of the interpretation of scintigraphic findings obtained with those tracers for pre-therapeutic prediction of tumour response to treatment. Furthermore, the enhanced Tc-99m-HL91 accumulation in hypoxic tumour cells indicates the usefulness of this tracer in this regard."

This group has become known as an important pathogen in infections and abscesses, but data on the anatomical distribution of these species is lacking in relation to clinical significance. We obtained 275 strains of the S. milleri group from different departments at our hospital over the last 3 years, including 54 strains from dental surgery, 47 from internal medicine, 44 from otolaryngology (head and neck), 43 from surgery, 32 from gynecology, 17 from urology, 16 from dermatology, 11 from brain surgery, 6 from pediatrics, 3 from orthopedics, and 2 from opthalmology. The 44 strains from head and neck were found in 42 patients,--23 with primary infection and 19 with secondary infection induced by cancer treatments. The primary infection group included 4 deep neck abscesses, 1 peritonsillar abscess, 5 tonsillitis, 4 paranasal sinusitis, 3 congenital aural fistula infections, 2 dental infections, 2 paranasal sinus cysts, 1 supprative parotitis, and 1 postoperative wound infection. The secondary infection group included 7 postoperative wound infections, 3 postoperative pulmonary infections, 3 laryngitis and pharyngitis, 3 terminal pneumonias, and 3 infections of the local recurrence site. The S. milleri group was the only isolated organism in 13 cases (56.5%) of primary infection and in 5 (26.3%) of secondary infection. Among other organisms from the primary infection group, no so-called major pathogens were found. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of the S. milleri group showed that 50% were resistant to CCL and 33% to CTM. ABPC, CPDX, and CFDN were also found to be less sensitive, although no resistant strains were detected. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic atmosphere is required, and differentiation of the 3 requires biochemical reactivity tests. Since not all facilities use identical techniques in routine bacteriological examination, a considerable number of the S. milleri group could be missed in unknown species of alpha-,beta-, and gamma-streptococci and culture-negative cases. With antibiotics now being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in head and neck infections due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense."

Monitoring has confirmed the success of these policies with progressive declines of heavy metals in for example air, sewage sludge and environmental samples. For zinc, such improvements may nevertheless be counter-acted by its widely usage as a feed additive and veterinary medicinal product to piglets in the post-weaning period resulting in reduced occurrence of diarrhea and improvement of daily weight gain. This review therefore focuses on two major concerns associated with veterinary use of zinc, namely the quantifiable risks to the environment and promotion of (multi) resistant bacteria like LA-MRSA in pig farms. Denmark is used as an informed and realistic worst-case scenario, representing the largest pig production per capita in Europe. It is furthermore, one of the countries where most recent information can be found regarding soil monitoring data and zinc consumption within the pig production. An average increase in soil concentration by > 45\% was recently reported within the period 1998-2014. In order to predict future risk, this review presents new and simplified model predictions using current soil concentrations, annual load rates and predicted accumulation rates. In conclusion, it is estimated that within 25 years, continued agricultural practice of current zinc loads may result in a situation where almost all soils receiving manure from intensive piglet production may be at risk, but also other pig production types may result in scenarios with predicted risk to soil dwelling species, especially in sandy soils. Besides the quantifiable risks to soil ecosystems, high levels of zinc furthermore co-select for the persistence of LA-MRSA CC398 and other resistant bacteria on pig farms."

The aim of the study was to characterize clinical and environmental Staphylococcus pettenkoferi isolates with regard to genomic diversity and antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Repetitive-sequence-based PCR and core genome phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data verified the presence of distinct clades comprising closely related S. pettenkoferi isolates from different geographical locations and origins. Methodology. Phylogenetic relationships between 25 S. pettenkoferi isolates collected from blood cultures and intra-operative air sampling were determined by repetitive-sequence-based PCR typing and analysis of similar to 157 000 SNPs identified in the core genome after WGS. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and tests for biofilm production (microtitre plate assay) were performed. Results. Repetitive-sequence-based PCR as well as WGS data demonstrated the close relatedness of clinically significant blood culture isolates to probable contaminants, as well as to environmental isolates. Antibiotic-susceptibility testing demonstrated a low level of antimicrobial resistance. The mecA gene was present in two cefoxitin-resistant isolates. No isolates were found to produce biofilm. Conclusion. Close genomic relatedness of S. pettenkoferi isolates from different geographical locations and origins were found within clades, but with substantial genomic difference between the two major clades. The ecological niche of S. pettenkoferi remains unconfirmed, but the presence of S. pettenkoferi in the air of the operating field favours the suggestion of a role in skin flora. Identification of S. pettenkoferi in clinical samples should, in a majority of cases, most likely be regarded as a probable contamination, and its role as a possible pathogen in immunocompromised hosts remains to be clarified."

The implementation of these techniques in endoscopy facilities and provider opinions regarding reprocessing priorities remain unknown. Methods: Physicians, nurse managers, nurses, and infection control staff at endoscopy units performing ERCP in the United States were surveyed to assess current institutional practices and individual opinions regarding future reprocessing solutions. Results: A total of 249 distinct institutions participated in the survey. Of these, 223 (89.6\%) implemented at least 1 of the 4 supplemental reprocessing methods after MDRO outbreaks. Overall, 63\% of centers used repeat HLD, 53\% performed surveillance microbiological culturing, 35\% used liquid chemical sterilization, and 12\% used ethylene oxide sterilization. Thirty-seven centers (15\%) routinely screened patients for MDRO. Forced-air drying after reprocessing was used by 47.8\% of centers. Fifty percent of individual respondents, including 58.6\% of physicians, believed that redesign of the duodenoscope is the best long-term reprocessing solution. The majority (55.1\%) identified efficacy to be the single most important factor in selecting a reprocessing technique. Conclusions: Although most endoscopy centers have implemented enhanced duodenoscope reprocessing techniques, there is a large variation in practice. Most providers believe that duodenoscope redesign and identifying reprocessing techniques with maximal efficacy are the long-term priorities. Improved adherence to forced-air drying in duodenoscope reprocessing is needed."

Further, some argue that for the last 50 years advances in drug and vaccine development have plateaued. In the face of serious challenges, such as increasing antibiotic resistance, the threat of global pandemics such as Ebola, aging populations, increasing healthcare costs, and a general lack of access to medicines by many in developing regions, this paper argues that the current paradigm of pharmaceutical R\&D is not able to address these problems adequately. Probabilistic innovation theory predicts how the convergence of technologies and methods such as expert crowdsourced R\&D may ultimately contribute to real-time problem-solving. These potentialities are described as a new paradigm in R\&D. Such a paradigm might be uniquely suited to an industry that has perhaps moved beyond small molecule R\&D into a new era of complex protein-based R\&D associated with an almost infinite problem space' that is dependent on economies of scale in R\&D efforts. This paper therefore offers a perspective on these challenges, and provides certain arguments in support of novel, technologically enabled approaches to scientific problem-solving."

Membrane-active antibiotic peptides such as polymyxin B (PxB) hold promise as the next generation of antibiotics, since they rarely spur the evolution of resistance. At low concentrations in the membrane, PxB forms vesicle-vesicle contacts and induces lipid exchange without leakage or fusion, a phenomenon that can explain its specificity towards Gram-negative bacteria by contact formation between the two phospholipids interfaces in the periplasmatic space. In this work, the interaction of PxB and the nonantibiotic derivative polymyxin B nonapeptide (PxB-NP) with monolayers of Escherichia coli membrane lipids (ECL) has been studied by thermodynamic and structural methods. PxB inserts itself into ECL monolayers as a conformation that forms intermembrane contacts with vesicles injected underneath, and induces lipid exchange when the monolayer surface pressure is set at 32 mN/m (membrane equivalence pressure) or net transfer vesicle-to-monolayer at lower surface pressures. Thermodynamic analysis of the compression isotherms of mixed monolayers indicates that PxB inserts into the monolayer with an expansion of the mean molecular area, implying that peptide and lipids form nonideal mixtures. At low concentrations, corresponding to the membrane-membrane contact form of PxB, the mixed monolayers present positive excess energy values (DeltaG(m)(Ex)), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging reveals structures of similar to120-nm diameter that protrude from the lipid surface similar to0.7 nm. At concentrations of PxB above 4 mol \%, thermodynamic analysis gives a very high DeltaG(m)(Ex), corresponding to nonfavorable interactions, and AFM images show round structures of 20-30nm diameter. PxB-NP behaves in a totally different way, in agreement with its inability to form. vesicle-vesicle contacts and its lack of antibiotic effect. These results are discussed in the light of the mechanism of action of PxB on the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

We also included days of isolation used to rule out the presence of these infections. All data from the medical-surgical and intensive care units were included unless the start date or end date of isolation was missing. Utilization percentages (isolation days divided by total hospital days) were calculated for the total period, for each month, and for each category of isolation. Results: During the study period, 18.1\% of hospital days were devoted to isolation (13.7\% for definite infection and 4.4\% to rule out infection). Monthly utilization ranged from 13.4\% to 22\%.

It is widely used against bacterial infections as well as food additive to a live-stock. Since tetracycline is resistant against degradation, it accumulates in the environment, leading also to antibiotic residues in animal and food products, which is now considered to be an important health risk because of increasing antibiotic resistance of pathogenic microorganisms. In this work we studied the interactions of tetracycline with phospholipid monolayers at the air/water interface in order to elucidate the mechanism of its action on cell membrane biomimetic system. We selected three phosphatidylcholines, having the same head-group structure, differing with respect to their hydrophobic chain length, the presence of unsaturated bonds between carbon atoms and, consequently, the phase transition temperature. Analysis of the results presented here suggests that tetracycline interacts with the three phosphatidylcholines mainly through the electrostatic interactions with hydrophilic groups of these lipids. On the other hand, the shape of presented pressure-area isotherms and their compressibility moduli show the synergistic effect of hydrophobic interactions that are larger for longer alkyl chains, promoting easier ordering of monolayer molecules with increased surface pressure when drug is present in the subphase, particularly for saturated DPPC. Based on our contact potential data we think that positively charged tertiary amino group of TC is facing negatively charged phosphate groups of phosphatidylcholines, penetrating only the hydrophilic head group region but not the hydrophobic moiety of these monolayers. However, the observed differences in CPD values for the case of DMPC point toward the drug disordering influence also on the organization of the hydrophobic region of this monolayer. This is because the drug penetration disturbs the van der Waals ordering interactions between its shorter hydrophobic chains to a greater extent comparing to DPPC and DOPC molecules.

The bacterial samples were collected during the late spring season. Culturable bacteria were deposited on the nutrient media on Petri dishes to investigate the viable-culturable count (VCC) of bacteria and bacterial community structure using a Biolog GEN III system. In total, 12 species of bacteria were identified, with the most isolated Macrococcus equipercicus, Micrococcus luteus D, Staphylococcus xylosus (indoor), and Bacillus species (outdoor). The indoor mean concentrations of bacterial aerosol ranged from 10(2) to 10(3) CFU m(-3), below Polish proposals for threshold limit standards in office buildings. The indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios indicated that studied air pollutants in the office rooms originated from the indoor air.

Mouse IFN (10(4) units/ml) had no inhibitory effect on the developmental ability of the preimplantation embryos with or without the zona pellucida: 88 and 89% of the embryos in each group, respectively, reached the morula-early blastocyst stages. The preimplantation mouse embryos were sensitive to the embryotoxic effect of EMC virus: at a multiplicity of 20 infection particles per embryo the development of 43% of embryos was inhibited. The zona pellucida had no significant protective effect: Its removal changed only slightly the susceptibility of the preimplantation embryos to this virus. Pretreatment of embryos with IFN did not protect them from the embryotoxic effect of EMC virus. This work indicates that preimplantation mouse embryos appear to be resistant for both the antiviral and antiproliferative activities of IFN."

As resistance to antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments is needed. Nanodiamond particles (NDPs) are actively researched as drug delivery platforms due to their biocompatibility, particle size, and stable inert core. This research is aimed at developing NDPs as antibiotic drug delivery platforms for treating UTIs. To this end, 100 nm, 75 nm, 25 nm and 6 nm size NDPs are purified with acid and heat treatment techniques. Raman spectra of the NDPs showed that the acid treatment method resulted in higher diamond yield. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies showed that both purification techniques result in oxygen terminated surface groups. Efficiency of loading amoxicillin on 25 nm NDPs based on electrostatic interaction of NDPs, functionalizing surfaces of NDPs with hydrogen, and polyethylenimine (PEI) are investigated. It it found that the electrostatic and surface hydrogenation approaches are not efficient in loading amoxicillin on the NDPs. On the other hand, PEI functionalized NDPs produced successful loading with amoxicillin as indicated by the presence of the beta-lactam peak at 1770 cm(-1), amide peak at 1680 cm(-1), and bond between PEI NH stretching and amoxicillin -COOH group at 3650 cm(-1) by the FTIR spectra. These results are expected to lay the foundation for developing NDP based targeted drug delivery treatment techniques for treating UTIs and other infectious diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A nosocomial infections incidence of 13.3% among surgically treated patients has been registered in 2000. Deep surgical site infections were the most frequent localizations, and microbes isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus with an high oxacillin resistance (70.6%-76.5%). From the observation of the risk factors the sterilization system has been modified and the assistance and environmental protocols have been improved. In the further evaluation period, a global reduction of nosocomial infections incidence (7.1%), of surgical site infections (from 10.1% to 4.5%) (p = 0.007), of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus isolations have been obtained even if short results in antibiotic resistances have been registered. Thoracic Surgery has to be considered an area at medium-high risk of nosocomial infections. The quite high incidence of nosocomial infections recorded at the beginning of the study in presence of prevalent deep surgical site infections from staphylococci with an high oxacillin resistance compelled to promote corrections. These lead to a remarkable decrease in incidence of nosocomial infections even if the same results can not be reached in antibiotic resistances."

After exposure to EV, cells of host defense-epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils-had reduced antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA).

Not only transporting infectious individuals from one place to another, air travel also provides a chance for infectious diseases transmission during the flight, especially if the disease can be transmitted via the airborne route. A number of documented outbreaks of airborne transmissible diseases were associated with disease transmission during the air travel. This study performed retrospective analysis on an infamous multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreak on a commercial flight, where 6 people were infected with the multi-drug resistant disease during the 8.75 h flight. Airflow pattern and the infectious particle dispersion in the aircraft cabin were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Infection risks of the passengers under a range of infectious source strength values were then assessed using the dose-response model. Based on the risk data, the infectious source strength of the index case passenger was estimated by likelihood analysis. A concept of mix-ratio was introduced to estimate the impact of human movement and cough behavior on the disease transmission. From the maximum likelihood estimation, the index case passenger may have generated 17.2 millions of viable bacilli/hr during the flight. Spatial pattern of the infection case and the spatial variation of infection risk were reflected in this estimation. The findings of this study provide additional understanding of infectious disease transmission during air travel. The infectious source strength of MDR-TB estimated from this study can be used in further risk assessment on the disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Methods: The study was conducted over a 10-year period. Unit 1 (2002-2007) consisted of laminar airflow rooms where caregivers were required to wear a sterile outfit (gown, gloves, hat, and mask). Unit 2 (2008-2012) included spacious positive air pressure rooms with HEPA filters where only a clean gown and mask were required to be worn.

A multitude of respiratory effects have been noted by workers and neighbors, some of which are severe enough to cause workers to leave the industry. The mental health of CAFO neighbors appears to suffer as well, mainly because of noxious odors and stress. Concentrated animal feeding operations also contribute to the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which have the potential to harm populations nationwide. Although research is being done on this topic around the world, the nursing literature contains very little information on health effects from CAFOs.

In the last few decades, work has been done on the antimicrobial properties of copper and its alloys against a range of micro-organisms threatening public health in food processing, healthcare and air conditioning applications; however, an optimum copper method of surface deposition and mass structure has not been identified. RESULTS: A proof-of-concept study of the disinfection effectiveness of three copper surfaces was performed. The surfaces were produced by the deposition of copper using three methods of thermal spray, namely, plasma spray, wire arc spray and cold spray The surfaces were then inoculated with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). After a two hour exposure to the surfaces, the surviving MRSA were assayed and the results compared.The differences in the copper depositions produced by the three thermal spray methods were examined in order to explain the mechanism that causes the observed differences in MRSA killing efficiencies. The cold spray deposition method was significantly more effective than the other methods. It was determined that work hardening caused by the high velocity particle impacts created by the cold spray technique results in a copper microstructure that enhances ionic diffusion, and copper ions are principally responsible for antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: This test showed significant microbiologic differences between coatings produced by different spray techniques and demonstrates the importance of the copper application technique. The cold spray technique shows superior anti-microbial effectiveness caused by the high impact velocity imparted to the sprayed particles which results in high dislocation density and high ionic diffusivity."

In situ treatment technologies, which can be used on-site in pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and at manufacturing plants, might provide a solution. In this study we explored the use of Pyropure, a microscale combined pyrolysis and gasification in situ treatment system for destroying pharmaceutical wastes. This involved selecting 17 pharmaceuticals, including 14 of the most thermally stable compounds currently in use and three of high environmental concern to determine the technology's success in waste destruction. Treatment simulation studies were done on three different waste types and liquid, solid, and gaseous emissions from the process were analyzed for parent pharmaceutical and known active transformation products. Gaseous emissions were also analyzed for NOx, particulates, dioxins, furans, and metals. Results suggest that Pyropure is an effective treatment process for pharmaceutical wastes: over 99 \% of each study pharmaceutical was destroyed by the system without known active transformation products being formed during the treatment process. Emissions of the other gaseous air pollutants were within acceptable levels. Future uptake of the system, or similar in situ treatment approaches, by clinics, pharmacists, and manufacturers could help to reduce the levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment and reduce the economic and environmental costs of current waste management practices."

Bacterial biofilm is defined as a community of microorganisms irreversibly attached to a surface, producing extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), exhibiting an altered phenotype and having increased resistance to innate immune responses and antibiotics. Our study objectives were to screen uterine E. coli for their biofilm forming potential (BFP) and to investigate antibiotic resistance of any identified BFP-E.coli isolates against commonly used equine intra-uterine antibiotics. The BFP of uterine E. coli isolates (n = 52) was evaluated using the Crystal Violet (CV) assay. E. coli were grown in Luria enrichment broth (LB) for 24 h at 37 degrees C, bacterial suspensions were diluted 1:100 with fresh LB, and 100- L aliquots were incubated in 96-well plates for 24 h. Plates were washed to remove free bacteria, air dried, 125 mu L 0.5\% CV stain was added to each well for 10 min, followed by washing to remove excess stain. Acetic acid (30\%) was used to solubilize any remaining stain and the optical density OD570 of each well was measured. Based on the OD value, isolates are categorized as strong (OD > 0.4) moderate (0.4 >= OD >= 0.2) or weak (OD < 0.2) BFP isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of strong BFP isolates (n = 9) for timentin, ceftiofur, gentamicin and amikacin (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 5121,tg/mL) in their planktonic state (PlankMIC) and in their biofilm state (BioMIC) was measured using the resazurin assay. Resazurin is a blue reagent that fluoresces red when reduced by metabolically active viable cells. The PlankMIC was measured by adding antibiotics and diluted bacterial suspensions to 96-well plates, incubating for 24 h at 37 degrees C, followed by the addition of 10 mu l of resazurin, incubation at 37 degrees C for an additional 90 min, and the absorbance of each well was read at 590 nm. The BioMIC was determined by first allowing biofilm formation within wells for 24 h, followed by washing to remove free bacteria. Antibiotics and fresh LB was added to the biofilm-coated wells and the BioMIC evaluated as described for PlankMIC using the resazurin assay. Evaluated E. coli were classified as having strong (31\%; 16/52), moderate (8\%; 4/52), or weak (61.5\%; 32/52) BFP. The combined median fold increase of BioMIC over PlankMIC for timentin, ceftiofur, gentamicin and amikacin was 8, 10, 8 and 7 respectively. These results show that 31\% of uterine E. coli isolates demonstrate strong BFP in vitro and that strong biofilm-forming isolates in a biofilm state exhibit a large increase in antibiotic resistance in comparison to the isolate's planktonic state. In conclusion, by combining clinical history and evaluating E. coli BFP, we believe treatment strategies can be better optimized for mares with chronic endometritis."

Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have a huge potential in dermatology and wound care management because of their ability to release silver ions (Ag+ ions) in a prolonged and sustained way. However, negative effects of silver on the patient's cells should not be underestimated. Furthermore, it has been controversially discussed whether AgNP are responsible for nanoparticle-specific outcomes or not. In this study, we investigated the effects of AgNP on human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) in order to better understand the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and to improve the use of this highly reactive biocide in wound healing. We found that most of the cells with internalized AgNP displayed the typical morphological signs of apoptosis. The cell viability assay (XTT) showed concentration-dependent toxic effects of the AgNP toward HaCaT cells. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by AgNP was investigated in cell suspensions by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In order to distinguish between the effects of Ag+ ions released during AgNP storage and those of Ag+ ions released after nanoparticle application, we compared AgNP stored under air (O-2) with AgNP stored under argon (Ar). Dispersions of AgNP stored under Ar have a low content of Ag+ ions because of the absence of oxygen which is needed for oxidative dissolution. The results show that Ag+ ions released during particle storage are responsible for most of the ROS produced during 1 h incubation with the cells. AgNP (Ar) also induced intracellular ROS but to a much smaller extent compared to AgNP (O-2). These findings highlight the complexity of experiments to assess the toxicity of AgNP and suggest the possibility of reducing AgNP toxic effects by storing AgNP formulations and even silver-containing wound dressing under an inert gas atmosphere.

The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Among coagulase types of a total of 78 strains, Type II, Type IV and Type VII were 84.6%, 12.8% and 2.6%, respectively. No clear difference in coagulase types were observed among their origins of isolation. 2. MIC90 of ABK against 42 strains isolated from the air passage of suspected pneumoniae patients and 36 strains isolated from the blood of suspected septicemia patients were 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, and MIC90 of ABK against the 78 strains was 1.56 micrograms/ml, which was equal to that of vancomycin (VCM). 3. Most of these strains exhibited resistance against multiple antibiotic agents including cefmetazole (CMZ), imipenem (IPM), fosfomycin (FOM) and minocycline. Strains isolated from the blood were mostly resistant to multiple agents, and most of them were especially highly resistant to CMZ and IPM. ABK, however, showed potent antimicrobial activities even to those strains. These results were similar to the results obtained several years ago. 4. Considering the fact that ABK demonstrates not only potent antimicrobial activities against MRSAs isolated from the pediatric patients, but also shows remarkable clinical effects with concomitant use with beta-lactams or FOM, the prospect of ABK use in MRSA infectious diseases of children is excellent."

This review focuses on the global problem and the current state of available environmental interventions. TB transmission is facilitated in overcrowded, poorly ventilated congregate settings, such as hospitals, clinics, prisons, jails, and refugee camps. The best means of TB transmission control is source control-to identify unsuspected infectious cases and to promptly begin effective therapy. However, even with active case finding and rapid diagnostics, not every unsuspected case will be identified, and environmental control measures remain the next intervention of choice. Natural ventilation is the main means of air disinfection and has the advantage of wide availability, low cost, and high efficacy-under optimal conditions. It is usually not applicable all year in colder climates and may not be effective when windows are closed on cold nights in warm climates, for security, and for pest control. In warm climates, windows may be closed when air conditioning is installed for thermal comfort. Although mechanical ventilation, if properly installed and maintained, can provide adequate air disinfection, it is expensive to install, maintain, and operate. The most cost-effective way to achieve high levels of air disinfection is upper room germicidal irradiation. The safe and effective application of this poorly defined intervention is now well understood, and recently published evidence-based application guidelines will make implementation easier."

(i) To isolate micromonosporae, a water suspension of air-dried soil is first treated with 1.5\% phenol, diluted with water and then cultured on HV agar supplemented with both tunicamycin and nalidixic acid. (ii) To isolate microbisporae, air-dried soil is heated in a hot-air oven at 120-degrees-C for 1 h. A water suspension of the heated sample is then treated with a solution of 1.5\% phenol and 0.03\% chlorhexidine gluconate (CG), diluted and cultured on HV agar supplemented with nalidixic acid. The phenol pretreatment of the soil killed bacteria and streptomycetes in the samples, while keeping micromonosporae and microbisporae alive. The use of tunicamycin suppressed the growth of the remaining microbisporae on HV agar isolation plates, thereby facilitating the intensive isolation of micromonosporae. On the other hand, the dry heat treatment of the soil drastically reduced the number of bacteria in the sample and significantly reduced the numbers of streptomycetes and micromonosporae, without reducing the microbisporae content. Further treatment with a mixture of phenol and CG eliminated dry heat-resisting actinomycetes apart from microbisporae. Dilution plating of samples subjected to heat and the phenol-CG treatment resulted in the intensive isolation of microbisporae on HV agar. From various field soils (vegetable, orchard, corn, and rice paddy), the methods described above always enabled the highly selective isolation of micromonosporae and microbisporae, respectively, as each group accounted for more than 90\% of the total number of colonies recovered."

Staphylococci were isolated from air, manure, and nostrils of horses located in three horse riding centers, differing in horse stabling systembox stall stabling (OJK Pegaz and KJK Szary) and free-range stabling (SKH Nielepice). The dominant species was Staphylococcus vitulinus. A large variation in the frequency of occurrence of individual species between horse riding centers was determined. Resistance to antibiotics was determined by means of disc diffusion method and polymerase chain reaction technique to detect mecA genes responsible for methicillin resistance. In total, 408 strains were collected, most from SKH Nielepice, and least from OJK Pegaz. The highest resistance was found to gentamicin and tetracycline. Multidrug-resistant isolates were also detected in KJK Szary (10), in SKH Nielepice (5), and in OJK Pegaz (4). Methicillin resistance determined by disk diffusion assay was found in 23 strains, while the mecA gene was detected in 142 isolates. A total of 137 strains holding the mecA gene are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), which, as shown by our own studies, may be a reservoir of methicillin resistance. Most commonly, the mecA gene was found in staphylococci isolated in KJK Szary (61.70%).

However, translocation of the organism to the peritoneal cavity can lead to peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess formation, bacteremia, and sepsis. During translocation, B. fragilis is exposed to increased oxidative stress from the oxygenated tissues of the peritoneal cavity and the immune response. In order to survive, B. fragilis mounts a robust oxidative stress response consisting of an acute and a prolonged oxidative stress (POST) response. This report demonstrates that the ability to induce high levels of resistance to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) after extended exposure to air can be linked to the POST response. Disk diffusion assays comparing the wild type to a Delta dps mutant and a Delta dps Delta bfr mutant showed greater sensitivity of the mutants to tBOOH after exposure to air, suggesting that Dps and DpsL play a role in the resistance phenotype. Complementation studies with dps or bfr (encoding DpsL) restored tBOOH resistance, suggesting a role for both of these ferritin-family proteins in the response. Additionally, cultures treated with the iron chelator dipyridyl were not killed by tBOOH, indicating Dps and DpsL function by sequestering iron to prevent cellular damage. An in vivo animal model showed that the Delta dps Delta bfr mutant was attenuated, indicating that management of iron is important for survival within the abscess. Together, these data demonstrate a role for Dps and DpsL in the POST response which mediates survival in vitro and in vivo. IMPORTANCE B. fragilis is the anaerobe most frequently isolated from extraintestinal opportunistic infections, but there is a paucity of information about the factors that allow this organism to survive outside its normal intestinal environment. This report demonstrates that the iron storage proteins Dps and DpsL protect against oxidative stress and that they contribute to survival both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, this work demonstrates an important role for the POST response in B. fragilis survival and provides insight into the complex regulation of this response."

Mtb is continually exposed to endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of normal aerobic respiration, as well as exogenous ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generated by the host immune system in response to infection. The magnitude of tuberculosis (TB) disease is further amplified by exposure to xenobiotics from the environment such as cigarette smoke and air pollution, causing disruption of the intracellular prooxidant-antioxidant balance. Both oxidative and reductive stresses induce redox cascades that alter Mtb signal transduction, DNA and RNA synthesis, protein synthesis and antimycobacterial drug resistance. As reviewed in this article, Mtb has evolved specific mechanisms to protect itself against endogenously produced oxidants, as well as defend against host and environmental oxidants and reductants found specifically within the microenvironments of the lung. Maintaining an appropriate redox balance is critical to the clinical outcome because several antimycobacterial prodrugs are only effective upon bioreductive activation. Proper homeostasis of oxido-reductive systems is essential for Mtb survival, persistence and subsequent reactivation. The progress and remaining deficiencies in understanding Mtb redox homeostasis are also discussed."

The latter are chemically related to the cyclopropylindoline antitumor antibiotics and they share the same properties of sequence-selective DNA minor groove alkylation and high cytotoxic potency. Of three alkylating subunits investigated, the chloromethylbenzindoline (CBI) structure provided the most favorable prodrug properties: aerobic cytotoxic potency of the amines was approximately 90- to 3,000-fold higher than the corresponding nitro compounds, and the nitro compounds showed air/anoxia potency differentials of up to 300-fold. Selective alkylation of adenine N3 in calf thymus DNA by an amino-CBI was shown by characterization of the thermal depurination product; the same adduct was shown in hypoxic RIF-1 cells exposed to the corresponding nitro-CBI prodrug under hypoxic (but not oxic) conditions.

Thus, approaches to cancer treatment based on modulation of GSH should control possible growth-associated changes in GSH content and synthesis in these cells. Despite the potential benefits for cancer therapy of a selective GSH-depleting strategy, such a methodology has remained elusive up to now. Metastatic spread, not primary tumor burden, is the leading cause of cancer death. For patient prognosis to improve, new systemic therapies capable of effectively inhibiting the outgrowth of seeded tumor cells air needed. Interaction of metastatic cells with the vascular endothelium, activates local release of proinflammatory cytokines, which act as signals promoting cancer cell adhesion, extravasation, and proliferation. Recent work shows that a high percentage of metastatic cells with high GSH Levels survive the combined nitrosative and oxidative stresses elicited by the vascular endothelium. and possibly by macrophages and granulotyles. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase overexpression and an inter-organ flow of GSH (where the liverplays a central role), by increasing cysteine availability for tumor GSH synthesis, function in combination as a metastatic-growth promoting mechanism. The present review focuses on an analysis of links among GSH, adaptive responses to stress, molecular mechanisms of invasive cancer cell survival and death, and sensitization of metastatic cells to therapy.

Thus, detection of specific antibodies against occupational microbial antigens may lead to identification of potentially harmful species. For the purpose of IgG titer determination, indirect immunofluorescence on various bacterial isolates from duck hatchery air was combined with image-based quantification of fluorescence intensity. Moreover, in addition to established assays with pure bacterial cultures, a new approach utilized complex bioaerosol samples for detection of anti-microbial antibodies in human sera by determination of percentages of antibody bound cells in different serum dilutions. Mean titers in sera from hatchery workers and a non-exposed control group did not display significant differences for most tested isolates and application of comprehensive cluster analysis to entire titer data revealed no structure reflecting workers and controls group. Furthermore, determination of immunoreactivity to the complete microbial community in workplace air displayed similar proportions of antibody-bound cells in both groups. Although no general differences in immunoreaction patterns were observed, mean titers to a Proteus mirabilis isolate and to 3 of 4 distinct Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were higher in the group of hatchery workers than in the reference group indicating a potential applicability as exposure markers. We conclude, despite long term bioaerosol exposure, hatchery workers' IgG antibody profiles to tested antigens did not differ substantially from those of the control group.

To address potential pitfalls of infection control and clinical care in repatriated patients, we sought to provide microbiological insight into the possible origins of multi-drug antibiotic resistance in survivors of natural disasters. A review of the medical literature was performed from 1986 to 2006 with an emphasis on the 2004 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean. After natural disasters, polymicrobial infections may occur following heavy inoculation during trauma. Multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens are more prevalent than Gram-positive bacteria. A high incidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and difficult-to-treat fungal infections in otherwise immunocompetent hosts may challenge routine hospital, care. We recommend that survivors of natural disasters should be kept in pre-emptive contact isolation during air transport and hospitalisation until the results of all microbiological cultures become available. A meticulous diagnostic work-up is necessary upon admission and empiric antibiotic treatment should be avoided. Infections may also become manifest after several weeks of hospitalisation.

Box AIR primers and PCR were used to generate 2,466 rep-PCR and 1,531 HFERP DNA fingerprints from E. coli strains isolated from fecal material from known human and 12 animal sources: dogs, cats, horses, deer, geese, ducks, chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs, goats, and sheep. HFERP DNA fingerprinting reduced within-gel grouping of DNA fingerprints and improved alignment of DNA fingerprints between gels, relative to that achieved using rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting. Jackknife analysis of the complete rep-PCR DNA fingerprint library, done using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, indicated that animal and human isolates were assigned to the correct source groups with an 82.2\% average rate of correct classification. However, when only unique isolates were examined, isolates from a single animal having a unique DNA fingerprint, Jackknife analysis showed that isolates were assigned to the correct source groups with a 60.5\% average rate of correct classification. The percentages of correctly classified isolates were about 15 and 17\% greater for rep-PCR and HFERP, respectively, when analyses were done using the curve-based Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient, rather than the band-based Jaccard algorithm. Rarefaction analysis indicated that, despite the relatively large size of the known-source database, genetic diversity in E. coli was very great and is most likely accounting for our inability to correctly classify many environmental E. coli isolates. Our data indicate that removal of duplicate genotypes within DNA fingerprint libraries, increased database size, proper methods of statistical analysis, and correct alignment of band data within and between gels improve the accuracy of microbial source tracking methods."

The amoebae isolated were Acanthamoeba hatchetti and a Cochliopodium species. Two other amoeba cultures, an A. hatchetti culture and Cochliopodium bilimbosum, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were also tested. The cooling tower isolates were more resistant to most of the biocides than the ATCC isolates were. The isothiazolin derivative was the least inhibitory to all four amoeba isolates, and tributyltin neodecanoate mixed with quaternary ammonium compounds was the most inhibitory to three of the four isolates. After exposure to lower concentrations of the biocides, including for one strain the manufacturer's recommended concentration of one biocide, the cooling tower amoeba populations increased significantly compared with unexposed controls, whereas the ATCC isolates were not stimulated at any of the concentrations tested. In some cases, concentrations which stimulated cooling tower amoebae inhibited the growth of the ATCC isolates. These results suggest that cooling tower amoebae may adapt to biocides, underscoring the need to use freshly isolated cooling tower organisms rather than organisms from culture collections for testing the efficacy of such biocides. The stimulatory effect of biocides on amoeba populations is an alarming observation, since these organisms may be reservoirs for legionellae. Biocides used to control microbial growth may actually enhance populations of host organisms for pathogenic bacteria."

Thus, for effective anticancer chemotherapy, it is important to identify drugs with selective toxicity towards hypoxic cells. Quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides (QdNOs) are heterocyclic aromatic N-oxides that have been found to possess potent antibacterial activities (inhibit microbial DNA synthesis) especially under anaerobic conditions; thus they are under evaluation as bioreductive drugs for the treatment of solid tumors (1). We investigated the ability of four differently substituted QdNOs to inhibit cell growth and induce cell cycle changes in two human tumorigenic epithelial cell lines under oxic conditions. We also evaluated the toxicity of these drugs to cancer cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. Two epithelial cell lines (the T-84 human colon cancer-derived cell line, and the SP-1 keratinocyte cell line) were treated with various doses of the QdNOs and harvested at different times after treatment. Proliferation and cell cycle results showed a structure-function relationship in the activity of the various QdNO compounds with the 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl-6,7-dichloro-derivative of QdNO (DCBPQ) being the most potent cytotoxin and hypoxia-selective drug. The 2-benzoyl-3-phenyl (BPQ) and the 2-acyl-3-methyl-derivative of QdNO (AMQ) were less cytotoxic but arrested almost 50% of the cells in the G2M phase of the cell cycle at doses of 30 and 120 microM, respectively. The tetramethylene derivative of QdNO (TMQ) did not affect the growth and cycling of cells cultured in air and was the least potent cytotoxin to hypoxic cells. Our results indicate that the QdNOs are hypoxia-cytotoxic drugs whose activity varies according to the substituents on the quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide heterocycle. Because of their selective toxicity to hypoxic cells (cells found in human tumors), these drugs may provide useful therapeutic agents against solid tumors."

DESIGN: Retrospective survey. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association-Canada and l'Association des professionnels pour la prevention des infections who worked in Canadian hospitals received questionnaires. One questionnaire per hospital was completed. OUTCOME: Hospitals reported the number of respiratory TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases admitted, the engineering and environmental controls available, and the type of occupational TB screening programs available. Data were stratified by hospital size and risk of exposure to TB patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four (10.9%) hospitals with at least 500 beds admitted more than 50% of the TB cases, more than 40% of the multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases and more than 65% of the HIV cases. Thirty-six (11.6%) facilities classified as high risk hospitals reported more than 70% of the TB cases, more than 58% of the MDR-TB cases and more than 75% of the HIV cases. A significantly higher pooled average tuberculin test conversion rate was found in individuals working in high risk (4.4%) than in low risk hospitals (1.5%). Significantly more high risk than low risk hospitals had an isolation room with air exhausted outside, negative air pressure and at least six air changes per hour. Only 13 high risk hospitals had all three engineering characteristics. Surgical masks were used for respiratory protection in 18 (50%) high risk and 186 (77.8%) low risk hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may have occurred because TB programs available in many Canadian hospitals were inadequate."

This increase prompted us to survey hospitals in Texas to determine their degree of compliance with recommendations in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention TB guidelines. Methods: In April 1992, we mailed a voluntary questionnaire about TB infection control practices, health care worker tuberculin skin testing procedures, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis laboratory methods to a convenience sample of hospitals in Texas. Results: Of 180 hospitals surveyed, 151 (83\%) returned completed questionnaires. Of these, 90 (60\%) were nonteaching community hospitals; 28 (19\%) were teaching community hospitals; 13 (9\%) were university-affiliate hospitals; and 20 (13\%) were other hospitals. The number of hospitals to which patients with TB were admitted increased from 98 (65\%) in 1989 to 122 (81\%) in 1991. Respondent hospitals had a mean of 183 acute care beds (median 100, range 5 to 999), 6 acid-fast bacillus isolation rooms (median 2, range 0 to 57) and 7.5 admissions/year of patients with TB (median 2, range 0 to 202). Of hospitals responding to specific questions, 20\% (27/137) admitted patients with multidrug-resistant TB, 18\% (25/140) reported not having any acid-fast bacillus isolation rooms, and 28\% (35/125) had no rooms meeting all of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for acid-fast bacillus isolation (negative air pressure, greater than or equal to 6 air changes per hour, and air directly vented to the outside). The tuberculin skin test conversions among health care workers rose from 246 (0.6\%) in 1989 to 547 (0.9\%) in 1991. Conclusion: Although the number of Texas hospitals admitting patients with TB increased during 1989 through 1991, many facilities still did not have infection control practices consistent with the 1992 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention TB guidelines."

However, resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to anti-mycobacterial agents including INH is an increasing problem worldwide. Development of new anti-mycobacterial agents thus has attracted attention. Five lipid derivatives of INH were prepared in this study. They formed monolayers at the air/water interface, and some nanostructures with different morphologies were obtained through molecular self-assembly in water. The derivatives included one fatty acyl derivative containing a 12-C hydrocarbon-long chain (1), three fatty alcohol derivatives with a succinyl as spacer and an 8, 12 or 16-C hydrocarbon-long chain (2, 3 and 4), and one tetrahydro-2H-1,3,5-thiadiazine-2-thione (THTT) derivative containing a 12-C hydrocarbon-long chain (5). The surface pressure-area isotherms depended on the volume and configuration of heads and the length of tails of derivatives. Compound 2 had a relatively large head and a short tail, easily standing uprightly at the interface. Under a certain surface pressure, the linear polar head groups of 3 could be partly squeezed out and insert into subphase because the length of heads were comparable to the one of tails. The very long tails of 4 always maintained above the interface and led to a high collapse pressure. Compound 5 possessed an extended and large head consisting of the THTT and INH groups so that the relatively short tails tilted at the interface and difficultly contact with each other. The THTT rings might be partly squeezed out and enter into air under a certain surface pressure. The self-assembly behaviours of derivatives in water depended on the molecular configuration and agreed with the corresponding monolayer behaviours. The flexible and medium-long tails (1 and 3) led to the derivatives to form nanoscale vesicles, though the short or very long tails did not (2 and 4). Interestingly, intermolecular hydrogen bonding could occur between the molecules of 5, and improve the derivative forming helical nanofibres other than vesicles. The molecular self-assembly of INH's lipid derivatives was explored in details in this study. The formation mechanisms of self-assembled nanostructures were analyzed. Various types of self-assembled nanostructures were obtained and the formation mechanisms were analyzed. The relationship between the self-assembly and the molecular configuration of amphiphilic derivatives was also revealed. The lipid derivatives of INH show promising anti-Mycobacterium action because the amphiphilic prodrugs allow for better penetration of the bacterial cells. The self-assembled nanostructures may likely be the potential self-assembled drug delivery systems for tuberculosis therapy.  2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious threats to modern health care. However, how the petrol and diesel exhaust particles affect the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in various environments remain largely unknown. This study investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of four representative petrol and diesel exhaust particles, namely 97 octane petrol, 93 octane petrol, light diesel oil, and marine heavy diesel oil, on the horizontal transfer of ARGs between two opportunistic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, E. coli S17-1 (donor) and E. coli K12 (recipient). The results demonstrated that these four representative types of nano-scale particles induced concentration-dependent increases in conjugative transfer rates compared with the controls. The underlying mechanisms involved in the accelerated transfer of ARGs were also identified, including the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the consequent induction of oxidative stress, SOS response, changes in cell morphology, and the altered mRNA expression of membrane protein genes and those involved in the promotion of conjugative transfer. The findings provide new evidences and mechanistic insights into the antimicrobial resistance risks posed by petrol and diesel exhaust particles, and highlight the implications and need for stringent strategies on alternative fuels to mitigate air pollution and health risks."

To identify additional genes in the OxyR regulon, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to isolate proteins from a mutant that constitutively expresses genes in the regulon. The 28,500 Da protein thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx) was identified. Two additional genes induced during oxidative stress were identified adjacent to tpx, a putative RNA-binding protein (rbpA) and a cytochrome-c peroxidase (ccp). Transcriptional analyses showed that tpx and rbpA were transcribed as monocistronic mRNA species or as a bicistronic operon. Transcription of tpx was induced by exposure to air or H2O2 from an OxyR-dependent promoter and to a lesser extent from a second OxyR-independent promoter. Expression of the rbpA gene during oxidative stress was regulated by the OxyR-dependent tpx promoter resulting in the bicistronic tpx/rbp mRNA. The ccp gene was expressed only as a monocistronic message and induction was only observed after exposure to H2O2 in an OxyR-in dependent manner. Disruption of the tpx operon or ccp resulted in sensitivity to the organic peroxides cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) but not to H2O2.

Cotton is traditionally recommended but its structure contains short fibres which expand and contract, causing a rubbing movement that can irritate delicate skin. Dyes used in cotton garments can increase the potential of a sensitivity reaction. Cotton is also prone to bacterial and fungal attack. Silk garments are often closely woven which impedes the flow of air, and some people are allergic to the sericin protein in silk. Published studies suggest that a specially treated silk material (DermaSilk), which is loosely knitted, has had the sericin removed and has a microbial agent (AEM 5772/5) permanently bonded to it, is well tolerated and has beneficial effects on the skin of children and adults with atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis often becomes infected, commonly with Staphylococcus aureus. Some studies have investigated the use of clothing materials impregnated with substances such as silver, which has antimicrobial properties. However, these are still unproven and there are concerns about bacterial resistance and the local and environmental effects of silver. The use of the antimicrobial AEM 5772/5, which does not transfer to the skin of the patient, is a new development in the control of atopic dermatitis.

We find that gene pools are shaped by their broad ecological niche (such as sea water, fresh water, host, and airborne). We find that freshwater habitats act as a gene exchange bridge between otherwise disconnected habitats. Finally, certain antibiotic resistance genes deviate from the general trend of habitat specificity by exhibiting a high degree of cross-habitat mobility.

Therefore, a relatively simple method is required for evaluation of potential danger represented to man by the whole assembly of culturable microorganisms in an atmospheric aerosol sample. For bacteria, the method can be based on a number of individual characteristics of each microorganism determined in the course of bio-chemical and other test required for identification of the detected bacterium, and a number of other tests. It is proposed to classify the measured individual characteristics of bacteria under four groups of indices responsible for: (i) potential pathogenicity for man; (ii) the numbers of bacteria in the sample; (iii) resistance to unfavorable environmental factors; (iv) drug resistance of bacteria. Each of four groups of indices is numerically evaluated by a certain integral index, which quantitatively reflects the contribution of experimentally determined characteristics of bacteria. Expert evaluation of the contribution of each characteristic of microorganisms to the correspond-ing group of indices is performed.

METHODS: A total of 384 strains of GABHS isolated from 377 patients (throat 335; other sites 49) from three hospitals in the lower St Lawrence region were analyzed for their susceptibility to erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, penicillin, clindamycin, cephalothin, rifampin and vancomycin by disk diffusion on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (MHB) at 35 masculineC in 5% carbon dioxide. Strains that were found to be intermediately resistant or resistant to one of the antibiotics by disc diffusion, strains from sites other than throat, and a sample of 97 pharyngeal strains were evaluated by E-test on MHB (35 masculineC, 5% carbon dioxide) for their susceptibility to the antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, penicillin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone. In addition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for erythromycin and azithromycin by broth microdilution using MH broth supplemented with 2.5 % of lysed horse blood (35 masculineC, ambient air) on strains that were resistant or intermediately resistant to the macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin). An evaluation was also carried out on these strains to determine the influence of the incubating atmosphere (ambient air versus 5% carbon dioxide) on susceptibility results obtained by disk diffusion (erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin) and E-test (erythromycin and azithromycin) methods. RESULTS: Nine strains (2%) from nine patients (throat eight, pus one) were resistant to all macrolides as tested by three different techniques (disk diffusion, E-test and microdilution). All strains were susceptible to all the other antibiotics tested. For the strains intermediately resistant or resistant to macrolides, incubation in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere was associated with a reduction in the diameter of inhibition determined by disk diffusion (P<0.001) with frequent minor variations in interpretation, and with an increase in the MIC by E-test (P<0.001), which had no impact on interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance of GABHS to macrolides was not common (2%) in the lower St Lawrence Region. GABHS susceptibility to erythromycin seemed to predict the susceptibility to the other macrolides. Significant variation in antibiogram results (disk diffusion and E-test) of GABHS susceptibility to macrolides was related to the incubation atmosphere and may have an impact on the interpretation of disk diffusion results."

Pigmented strains exhibited a higher degree of multiple drug resistance than did nonpigmented strains. However, the frequency of multiple drug resistance in nonpigmented strains was also substantial. An average of 91% of all strains were resistant to more than one antibiotic, and 21% of the bacteria isolated were resistant to five of the eight antibiotics tested. High numbers of plasmid-carrying strains were found among selected surface isolates, but the presence of detectable plasmids could not be correlated with either pigmentation or multiple drug resistance. Furthermore, selected surface isolates were significantly more resistant to mercury than were bulk-water bacteria.

In this study, nanostructured titania (TiO2) films with different concentrations of silver were prepared by magnetron sputtering and subsequently annealed at 600 degrees C in air. The effects of silver concentrations on microstructure, antibacterial property, corrosion resistance and hardness were studied. The results indicate that silver contribute to the growth of the TiO2 grains and is uniformly dispersed on the surface of annealed samples. The annealed films with a thickness of about 2.5 mu m are uniform and mainly composed of rutile phase and pure titanium. Silver mainly exists in the metallic state in the TiO2 films. The Ag-doped TiO2 films can effectively kill Staphylococcus aureus within 24 h and the antibacterial ability increases with the silver content. The dynamic potential polarization results show that silver incorporation into TiO2 films slightly lower the corrosion potential, but significantly decrease the current density, and the current density decreases as the silver addition increases. Moreover, the hardness of the Ag-doped TiO2 films is also greatly improved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Mitomycin C (MC) is a bacterial product that must be enzymatically reduced to exert anticancer activity. We have demonstrated that expression of the bacterial MC resistance-associated (MCRA) protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells confers profound resistance to this antibiotic under aerobic conditions, but not under hypoxia. MCRA produces resistance to MC by redox cycling of the activated hydroquinone intermediate back to the prodrug form. A CHO cell line developed by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of MC likewise expressed high level resistance to MC in air, but not under hypoxia. The overexpression of DT-diaphorase and NADPH:cytochrome c (P-450) reductase, two enzymes known to activate MC, restored sensitivity to MC in both MCRA-transfected and drug-selected cell lines. The level of sensitization was proportional to the quantity of enzyme activity expressed, supporting the concept that the levels of these two activating enzymes are important for sensitivity to MC. The findings of resistance to MC in air but not under hypoxic conditions and of restoration of sensitivity to MC by increasing levels of DT-diaphorase activity, properties not adequately explained by other resistance mechanisms (i.e., decreases in MC activation, repair of DNA lesions, and/or drug efflux), support the hypothesis that a functional mammalian homologue of MCRA may be involved in producing resistance to MC."

Methods: A mixed method study design was used and involved collecting both qualitative and quantitative data at regional, community, and individual levels. In-depth interviews with regional health representatives were conducted throughout Nunatsiavut (n = 11). In addition, three PhotoVoice workshops were held with Rigolet community members (n = 11), where participants took photos of areas, items, or concepts that expressed how climate change is impacting their health. The workshop groups shared their photographs, discussed the stories and messages behind them, and then grouped photos into re-occurring themes. Two community surveys were administered in Rigolet to capture data on observed climatic and environmental changes in the area, and perceived impacts on health, wellbeing, and lifestyles (n = 187). Results: Climate-sensitive health pathways were described in terms of inter-relationships between environmental and social determinants of Inuit health. The climate-sensitive health priorities for the region included food security, water security, mental health and wellbeing, new hazards and safety concerns, and health services and delivery. Conclusions: The results highlight several climate-sensitive health priorities that are specific to the Nunatsiavut region, and suggest approaching health research and adaptation planning from an EcoHealth perspective."

When such evolution requires deleterious intermediate mutations, fitness ridges and valleys arise in the pathogen's fitness landscape. The effect of deleterious intermediate mutations on within-host pathogen adaptation is examined with deterministic calculations, appropriate for pathogens replicating in large populations with high error rates. The effect of deleterious intermediate mutations on pathogen adaptation is smaller than their name might suggest: when two mutations are required and each individual single mutation is fully deleterious, the pathogen can jump across the fitness valley by obtaining two mutations at once, leading to a proportion of adapted mutants that is 20-fold lower than that in the situation where the fitness of all mutants is neutral. The negative effects of deleterious intermediates are typically substantially smaller and outweighed by the fitness advantages of the adapted mutant. Moreover, requiring a specific mutation order has a substantially smaller effect on pathogen adaptation than the effect of all intermediates being deleterious. These results can be rationalized when the number of routes of mutation available to the pathogen is calculated, providing a simple approach to estimate the effect of deleterious mutations. The calculations discussed here are applicable when the effect of deleterious mutations on the within-host adaptation of pathogens is assessed, for example, in the context of zoonotic emergence, antigenic escape, and drug resistance. IMPORTANCE Adaptation is critical for pathogens after zoonotic transmission into a new host species or to achieve antigenic immune escape and drug resistance. Using a deterministic approach, the effects of deleterious intermediate mutations on pathogen adaptation were calculated while avoiding commonly made simplifications that do not apply to large pathogen populations replicating with high mutation rates. Perhaps unexpectedly, pathogen adaptation does not halt when the intermediate mutations are fully deleterious. The negative effects of deleterious mutations are substantially outweighed by the fitness gains of adaptation. To gain an understanding of the effect of deleterious mutations on pathogen adaptation, a simple approach that counts the number of routes available to the pathogen with and without deleterious intermediate mutations is introduced. This methodology enables a straightforward calculation of the proportion of the pathogen population that will cross a fitness valley or traverse a fitness ridge, without reverting to more complicated mathematical models."

Material. - A review of existing recommendations on standard precautions, isolation precautions and specific recommendations in infection control. Results. - Isolation precautions complement standard precautions when a patient is identified as a carrier of bacteria showing resistance to antibiotics, virulence characteristics and/or epidemic potential. Full compliance with hand hygiene recommendations and standard precautions is mandatory as it optimizes safety when patient's viral and/or bacterial status is unknown. Acknowledging the routes of transmission, the value of individual protection equipment and good hygiene practices is therefore crucial in modern infection control. For specific micro-organisms, isolation precautions are needed against airborne, droplets and/or contact cross-contamination routes. Within isolation precautions, contact precautions are the most widely indicated as they control the risks of contamination from germs involved in cutaneous or enteric infections and of transmission of multi-resistant bacteria (MRB). In addition, specific recommendations have been defined for emerging resistant MRB. Conclusion. - MRB are becoming worldwide a major issue in public health. Reducing crosscontamination is, with lesser and better use of antibiotics, one of the main avenue in their control. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS."

Colors are classified according to protection method, blue for air-borne and green for contact precautions. Patients with blood stream pathogens such as hepatitis virus, syphilis or HIV are colored in red. 2) To regulate usage of antibiotics, all antibiotic prescriptions are monitored by the hospital pharmacy. Orders of intra-venous antibiotics longer than 16 days must report the reason to an infection control department. A warning message appears when prescribing specified antibiotics such as anti-MRSA drugs. 3) To detect outbreaks, numbers of patients who have infectious diseases are automatically counted every day and displayed on monitors in graphics. Results of this new system show the numbers of patients who had intravenous administration of antibiotics for longer than 15 days were 5.02.6 patients (meanSD). Only five multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) were detected in 32 months from January 2002. Surveillance of central line catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) revealed that infection occurred in only 0%, 2.2% and 2.0% per 1000 device days in the ICU and two common wards, respectively.

They are either congenital or acquired. Most acquired esophageal respiratory fistulae are of the esophageal tracheal and esophageal bronchial type and are caused by infections or malignant neoplasms, whereas esophageal pulmonary fistulae are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 72-year-old Caucasian man with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung presenting with abrupt-onset dyspnea during localized mediastinal radiotherapy. His laboratory test results suggested major respiratory infection. A chest x-ray revealed left apical lung radiopacity along with excavated lesions, consistent with secondary tumor infection. No clinical improvement was observed despite antibiotic treatment. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the chest confirmed persistent lung infection with unfavorable progression and air in the mediastinum; the latter suggested a fistula from the upper third of the esophagus to the upper left pulmonary lobe. Videofluoroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of an acquired esophageal pulmonary fistula. The patient underwent endoscopy, and an esophageal self-expandable metallic stent was deployed. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal pulmonary fistulae must be suspected whenever patients undergoing local mediastinal radiotherapy present with acute pulmonary complications, particularly pneumonia resistant to antibiotic treatment. Esophageal pulmonary fistulae are diagnosed by means of radiological imaging. Because esophageal respiratory fistulae are acute life-threatening conditions, prompt treatment with an endoscopically placed covered stent proves vital."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Listeria monocytogenes on different food contact surfaces was treated with ozone and OAF. Microbiological counts, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were performed. Ozone at 10 ppm gave <1-log reduction when L. monocytogenes was attached to stainless steel, while 45 ppm gave a log reduction of 3.41. OAF gave better log reductions than 10 ppm ozone, but lower log reductions than 45 ppm. Significant differences were found between surfaces. Biofilm organisms were significantly more resistant than those surface attached on stainless steel. SEM and AFM demonstrated different membrane and cell surface modifications following ozone or OAF treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The strain used demonstrated higher resistance to ozone than previous studies. This may be due to the fact that it was isolated from a food manufacturing premises that used oxidizing disinfectants. OAF was more effective at reducing the levels of the organism than an ozone concentration of 10 ppm. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pathogen management strategies must account for resistance of environmental strains when validating cleaning and disinfection. OAF has shown potential for surface decontamination compared with ozone. SEM and AFM are valuable tools for determining mechanisms of action of antimicrobial agents."

In the second stage, varied instrumental techniques were used for the analysis and characterization of the obtained nanostructures. Third, the bacteria of the Staphylococcus genus were isolated from the air under stable conditions with 47 sports and recreational horses, relatively. Next, isolated strains were identified using biochemical and spectrophotometric methods. The final step was the evaluation of the Staphylococcus genus sensitivity to nanosilver using the disk diffusion test. It has been proven that prepared silver nanoparticles exhibit strong antibacterial properties. The minimum inhibitory concentration for tested isolates was 30 mug/mL. It has been found that the sensitivity of Staphylococcus spp. isolated from six identified species differs considerably. The size distribution of bacterial growth inhibition zones indicates that resistance to various nanosilver concentrations is an individual strain feature, and has no connection with belonging to a specific species."

On these three farms, MRSA prevalence and MRSA air loads in stables rapidly increased during the production cycle, especially after releasing calves from their individual houses, but not simultaneously with or directly after treatment with antimicrobials.

Survival is attributed to an elaborate oxidative stress response that controls the induction of more than 28 peptides, but there is limited knowledge concerning the identities of these peptides. In this report, RNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed PCR identified five new genes whose expression increased following exposure to O-2. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned genes indicated that they encoded an outer membrane protein, an aspartate decarboxylase, an efflux pump, heat shock protein HtpG, and an NrdA ortholog constituting the large subunit of a class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RRase). Attention was focused on the nrdA gene since class I RRases are obligate aerobic enzymes catalyzing the reduction of ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates by a mechanism that requires molecular oxygen for activity. Sequence analysis of the nrd locus showed that two genes, nrdA and nrdB, are located in the same orientation in a 4.5-kb region. Northern hybridization and primer extension experiments confirmed induction of the genes by O-2 and suggested they are an operon. The B. fragilis nrdA and nrdB genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and CDP reductase assays confirmed that they encoded an active enzyme. The enzyme activity was inhibited by hydroxyurea, and ATP was shown to be a positive effector of CDP reductase activity, while dATP was an inhibitor, indicating that the enzyme was a class Ia RRase. A nrdA mutant was viable under anaerobic conditions but had decreased survival following exposure to O-2, and it could not rapidly resume growth after O-2 treatment. The results presented indicate that during aerobic conditions B. fragilis NrdAB may have a role in maintaining deoxyribonucleotide pools for DNA repair and growth recovery."

We examined the seasonal variations in airborne bacteria and several ARGs in PM2.5 across an industrial urban rural transect in a megacity of China over an annual cycle. Seasonality was most apparent at the rural site with a remarkable wintertime reduction in the total level of bacteria and an enrichment of certain ARGs in winter but dilution in spring. This contrasted with the relative consistency across seasons at urban and industrial sites. The statistical correlation between ARGs and the mobile genetic element (MGE), intI1, weakened from rural to urban and industrial sites, which hints at the diluting role of intI1 in horizontal gene transfers across the land use gradient. Differing mechanisms may regulate site-specific population exposure to transferable ARGs, and the identification of additional MGEs is warranted.

Intestinal infection with Giardia lamblia may lead to therapy-resistant, long-lasting post-giardiasis irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We report two open pilot studies aiming to treat this condition, using either antibiotics or bacterio-therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Twenty-eight patients with persistent abdominal symptoms, following clearance of G. lamblia infection, were investigated. Eighteen received treatment with rifaximin plus metronidazole (8-10 days) whereas 10 received a suspension of live faecal flora, installed into the duodenum during gastro-duodenoscopy. Customary abdominal symptoms and symptoms following a lactulose breath test were quantified by questionnaires. Hydrogen and methane production after lactulose were analysed in expired air and excretion of fat and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was examined in faeces. RESULTS. As compared with pre-treatment values, total customary symptom scores were barely significantly reduced (p = 0.07) after antibiotics, but were highly significantly reduced (p = 0.0009) after bacterio-therapy. However, symptom improvement following bacterio-therapy did not persist 1 year later. Hydrogen breath excretion was slightly reduced after antibiotics, but not after bacterio-therapy. Compared with healthy persons, faecal excretion of fat was significantly increased in Giardia-cured patients. SCFAs were increased in the bacterio-therapy group, and were not influenced by therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Both antibiotics and bacterio-therapy were ineffective with respect to cure of post-giardiasis IBS. High faecal excretion of fat and SCFAs suggests that intestinal malabsorption of fat and carbohydrates may play a role in the IBS-like complaints of these patients."

Here, we constructed a plastic, easy-to-use, fully sealed multiplex PCR chip based on reversible centrifugation for the simultaneous detection of 63 target DNA sequences. The structure of the chip is quite simple, which contains sine-shaped infusing channels and a number of reaction chambers connecting to one side of these channels. Primer pairs for multiplex PCR were sequentially preloaded in the different reaction chambers, and the chip was enclosed with PCR-compatible adhesive tape. For usage, the PCR master mix containing a DNA template is pipetted into the infusing channels and centrifuged into the reaction chambers, leaving the infusing channels filled with air to avoid cross-contamination of the different chambers. Then, the chip is sealed and placed on a flat thermal cycler for PCR. Finally, amplification products can be detected in situ using a fluorescence scanner or recovered by reverse centrifugation for further analyses. Therefore, our chip possesses two functions: 1) it can be used for multi-target detection based on end-point in situ fluorescence detection; and 2) it can work as a sample preparation unit for analyses that need multiplex PCR such as hybridization and target sequencing. The performance of this chip was carefully examined and further illustrated in the identification of 8 pathogenic bacterial genomic DNA samples and 13 drug-resistance genes. Due to simplicity of its structure and operation, accuracy and generality, high-throughput capacity, and versatile functions (i.e., for in situ detection and sample preparation), our multiplex PCR chip has great potential in clinical diagnostics and nucleic acid-based point-of-care testing."

Their bulkier hydrophilic PGMA blocks might induce a disturbance in the packing of liquid-crystalline lipid bilayers in addition to the effect caused by the hydrophobic PPO block alone. To gain a better insight into the polymer-membrane interactions at the molecular level, the adsorption kinetics and concomitant interactions of (PGMA(14))(2)-PPO34 with model membranes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPQ were monitored using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) coupled with Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and surface pressure (pi) measurements. The maximum penetration surface pressure of ca. 39 mN/m suggests that (PGMA(14))(2)-PPO34 is able to insert into lipid monolayers even above the so-called monolayer-bilayer equivalent pressure of 30-35 mN/m. Copolymer adsorption to a liquid-expanded DPPC-d(62) monolayer proceeds in a two-step mechanism: (i) initially only the more hydrophobic PPO middle block penetrates the lipid monolayer; (ii) following the liquid-expanded-liquid-condensed (LE-LC) phase transition, the bulky PGMA hydrophilic blocks are dragged into the headgroup region as the PPO block inserts further into the fatty acid region. The adsorption kinetics is considerably faster for DMPC-d(54) monolayers due to their higher fluidity. Copolymer adsorption to an LC-DPPC-d(62) monolayer leads to a change in the monolayer packing by forcing the lipid alkyl chains into a more vertical orientation, their tilt angle with respect to the surface normal being reduced from initially 30 degrees +/- 3 degrees to 18 degrees +/- 3 degrees. BAM images rule out macroscopic phase separation and show that coalescence of DPPC-d(62) LC domains takes place at relatively low surface pressures of pi >= 23 mN/m, suggesting that (PGMA(14))(2)-PPO34 partitions into both LE as well as LC domains."

Recombinational repair normally requires a battery of proteins, each with specific DNA recognition, strand transfer, resolution, or other functions. Helicobacter pylori lacks many of the proteins normally involved in the early stage (presynapsis) of recombinational repair, but it has a RecN homologue with an unclear function. A recN mutant strain of H. pylori was shown to be much more sensitive than its parent to mitomycin C, an agent predominantly causing DNA double-strand breaks. The recN strain was unable to survive exposure to either air or acid as well as the parent strain, and air exposure resulted in no viable recN cells recovered after 8 h. In oxidative stress conditions (i.e., air exposure), a recN strain accumulated significantly more damaged (multiply fragmented) DNA than the parent strain. To assess the DNA recombination abilities of strains, their transformation abilities were compared by separately monitoring transformation using H. pylori DNA fragments containing either a site-specific mutation (conferring rifampin resistance) or a large insertion (kanamycin resistance cassette). The transformation frequencies using the two types of DNA donor were 10- and 50-fold lower, respectively, for the recN strain than for the wild type, indicating that RecN plays an important role in facilitating DNA recombination. In two separate mouse colonization experiments, the recN strain colonized most of the stomachs, but the average number of recovered cells was 10-fold less for the mutant than for the parent strain (a statistically significant difference). Complementation of the recN strain by chromosomal insertion of a functional recN gene restored both the recombination frequency and mouse colonization ability to the wild-type levels. Thus, H. pylori RecN, as a component of DNA recombinational repair, plays a significant role in H. pylori survival in vivo."

Upwind of the barns, positive soil surface samples were found only sporadically. Significantly more positive LA-MRSA samples were found in summer than in the other seasons both in air and soil samples upwind and downwind of the pig barns. spa typing was used to confirm the identity of LA-MRSA types found inside and outside the barns. The results show that there is regular airborne LA-MRSA transmission and deposition, which are strongly influenced by wind direction and season, of up to at least 300 m around positive pig barns. The described boot sampling method seems suitable to characterize the contamination of the vicinity of LA-MRSA-positive pig barns by the airborne route."

Hierarchical clustering of samples by the most abundant 50 microbial orders generated three major nodes which primarily clustered by type of location. Because the indoor locations were longitudinally consistent, episodic relative increases in microbial genomic signatures related to the opportunistic pathogens Aspergillus, Penicillium and Stenotrophomonas were identified as outliers at specific locations. Further analysis of microbial reads specific for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia indicated homology to a sequenced multi-drug resistant clinical strain and we observed broad sequence coverage of resistance genes.

Methods: Enterococcus isolates were recovered from a variety of samples (n = 82; swine, feed/medicines/antiseptics and pig farm facilities) from six Portuguese farms, most using antibiotics. Antimicrobial susceptibility/conjugation assays were performed by standard procedures, bacterial identification/screening of antibiotic resistance genes were performed by PCR and clonality was determined using PFGE/multilocus sequence typing. Results: Enterococcus isolates resistant to antibiotics (n = 473) were recovered from samples of different origin (swine, feed/antiseptics, animal residues and pig farm facilities), but only the clinically relevant species Enterococcus faecium (n = 171) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 78) were included for further comprehensive molecular analysis. Isolates resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, erythromycin and aminoglycosides were better recovered in Slanetz-Bartley medium with these antibiotics present than in media not supplemented with antibiotics (P < 0.05). E. faecium was more frequently resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or nitrofurantoin and E. faecalis to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol or aminoglycosides (P < 0.05). Glycopeptide and erythromycin resistance rates were similar in both species. The transfer of resistance to several antibiotics, including vancomycin and ampicillin, was demonstrated. Clones associated with human infections were detected in different samples from the same farm {[}E. faecium from sequence type (ST) 78 lineage and E. faecalis ST16; manure, waste lagoons, faeces and drinking water] and in geographically distant farms {[}E. faecium clonal complex (CC) 5; E. faecalis CC21 and ST16]. Conclusions: The pig farm environment has an underestimated potential role in the transmission of MDR Enterococcus to animals and, possibly, to humans. The continuous contact of swine with MDR Enterococcus by different routes (e. g. feed, dust, air and rooms) might decrease the impact of restrictive antibiotic use policies and reinforces the need for different and preliminary interventions at the husbandry management level."

Most available vectors used in C. glutamicum carry antibiotic resistant genes as a genetic labeling for rapid identification of recombinant strains, and antibiotics have to be added to maintain the vector when growing the cells. These vectors, though excellent for laboratory use, are not preferable choices for industry-scale fermentation. In this work, we developed a novel expression system for use in C. glutamicum, which do not require antibiotics when used for industrial fermentation. This system includes two vectors: the shuttle vector pJYW-4 for expression of genes and the vector pJYW-6 for deletion of the essential gene air in C. glutamicum. The vector pJYW-4 contains a large multiple cloning site for cloning multiple genes and two selective markers: one is the kanamycin-resistant gene kan and the other is an essential gene air. The selective marker kan facilitates molecular manipulation or fermentations in the laboratory, and the selection marker air is good for use in industry-scale fermentation, allowing in vivo maintenance of the expression vector through auxotrophic complementation; therefore, the two selection markers in pJYW-4 make it useful for both laboratory research and industrial fermentation, and convenient to transfer valuable laboratory-developed strains into industrial production. This newly-constructed expression system was successfully used to increase L-valine production in C. glutamicum ATCC 14067, indicating its potential on developing amino acid-producing C. glutamicum strains.

The cough started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported increased sinus congestion and a sensation of ""something in her upper chest."" She denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. At physical examination, the patient was afebrile, borderline tachycardic (heart rate, 99 beats per minute), and mildly hypertensive (blood pressure, 138/99 mm Hg). Oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 3.5 x 10(9)/L (normal range, 3.2-9.8 x 10(9)/L). Pulmonary function testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively) (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process.

Basically polyester is hydrophobic in nature due to the absence of attracting polar groups and the dense packing in its polymeric structure. Due to the dense packing in polymeric structure and lack of hydroxyl groups of polyester it does not absorb water hence breathability is poor. The possibility of using air and oxygen plasma treatments for fibre surface activation to facilitate the improvement of hydrophilicity is attempted and has been improved. The purpose of this paper is to study the possibility of engineering the multifunctional of fabrics. Design/methodology/approach - The treated fabric is evaluated through measuring the ultraviolet protection factor, thermal resistance, and antibacterial activity properties. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy graphs show deposition of nano particles (NPs) of Chitosan, TiO2 and ZnO onto the fibre after washing several times. Findings - Air plasma-nano Chitosan treatment affects positively the antibacterial activity, thermal resistance of the fibre and air plasma-nano TiO2 and ZnO the fibre protection against ultraviolet rays. Furthermore, the plasma treatment solves an environmental problem which offers safe production process and working place and decreases the unit cost.

Poultry makes a substantial contribution to food security and nutrition, providing energy, protein, and essential micro-nutrients to humans, with short production cycles and the ability to convert a wide range of agri-food by-products and wastes into meat and eggs edible by humans. Poultry is the fastest growing agricultural sub-sector, especially in developing countries. The global poultry sector is expected to continue to grow as demand for meat and eggs is driven by growing populations, rising incomes and urbanisation. In this context, the sector is facing unprecedented challenges. Particularly for small holders and the poor, both in rural and urban areas, poultry is a major asset and key to poverty alleviation, providing income and market participation. Birds can be sold in times of crisis and act as household insurance. But the growing market is essentially benefiting large scale operations and access to market is critical for small holders. However, poultry represent a threat to human health, especially as a vector of infectious diseases and because of its role in antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, poultry has a significant impact on the environment and is a large consumer of natural resources. While the sector is usually seen as efficient in converting natural resources into edible products, it uses large amounts of land, water and nutrients for the production of feed materials and contributes to climate change, mainly through feed production, and air and water pollution."

TB is spread from person to person by airborne transmission. Several factors determine the probability of transmission, including the infectiousness of the source patient and the nature of the environment where exposure occurs. This initial infection (primary TB) rapidly progresses to disease in some persons (especially children and immunocompromised persons), but resolves spontaneously in most individuals. This condition in which the organism lies dormant is known as latent TB infection (LTBI). In the United States, the diagnosis of LTBI is made with either the tuberculin skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay. LTBI is treated with isoniazid (INH; usually for 9 months) to prevent progression to TB disease. Up to 5\% of immunocompetent persons will progress to TB disease at some time in the future, even decades after infection, if they are not treated for LTBI. Pulmonary TB disease is diagnosed using a combination of chest radiography and microscopic examination, culture and nucleic acid amplification testing of sputum. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB consists of at least 6 months of an INH and rifampin-containing regimen (with ethambutol and pyrazinamide for the first 2 months). In the United States, drug-resistant TB is relatively rare (approximately 1\% of all patients), and is treated with an 18-24 month individualized regimen based on drug susceptibility test results."

Nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis remains an important public health problem. We created an in vivo air sampling model to study airborne transmission of tuberculosis from patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to evaluate environmental control measures. Methods. An animal facility was built above a mechanically ventilated HIV-tuberculosis ward in Lima, Peru. A mean of 92 guinea pigs were continuously exposed to all ward exhaust air for 16 months. Animals had tuberculin skin tests performed at monthly intervals, and those with positive reactions were removed for autopsy and culture for tuberculosis. Results. Over 505 consecutive days, there were 118 ward admissions by 97 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, with a median duration of hospitalization of 11 days. All patients were infected with HIV and constituted a heterogeneous group with both new and existing diagnoses of tuberculosis. There was a wide variation in monthly rates of guinea pigs developing positive tuberculin test results (0\%-53\%). Of 292 animals exposed to ward air, 159 developed positive tuberculin skin test results, of which 129 had laboratory confirmation of tuberculosis. The HIV-positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis produced a mean of 8.2 infectious quanta per hour, compared with 1.25 for HIV-negative patients with tuberculosis in similar studies from the 1950s. The mean monthly patient infectiousness varied greatly, from production of 0-44 infectious quanta per hour, as did the theoretical risk for a health care worker to acquire tuberculosis by breathing ward air. Conclusions. HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis varied greatly in their infectiousness, and some were highly infectious. Use of environmental control strategies for nosocomial tuberculosis is therefore a priority, especially in areas with a high prevalence of both tuberculosis and HIV infection."

METHODS: We studied healthy adult volunteers with self-diagnosed colds of 48 to 96 hours' duration and obtained the following data: information on symptoms, computed tomographic (CT) studies of the nasal passages and sinuses, mucosal-transport times, measures of nasal-airway resistance, and viral-culture studies. Thirty-one subjects (mean age, 24 years) had complete evaluations, including CT scans, which were read without knowledge of the clinical data. An additional 79 subjects underwent the same evaluations, except the CT scans. RESULTS: Of the 31 subjects with CT scans, 24 (77 percent) had occlusion of the ethmoid infundibulum; 27 (87 percent) had abnormalities of one or both maxillary-sinus cavities; 20 (65 percent) had abnormalities of the ethmoid sinuses; 10 (32 percent) had abnormalities of the frontal sinuses; and 12 (39 percent) had abnormalities of the sphenoid sinuses. Infraorbital air cells were present in 14 subjects (45 percent), and pneumatization of the middle turbinate (concha bullosa) was noted in 11 subjects (35 percent). Also common were engorged turbinates (in 7 subjects) and thickening of the walls of the nasal passages (in 13).

We demonstrated that emission of bacteria and molds (Penicillium/Aspergillus) can reach values as high as 1E5 cell equivalents/min and that those emissions are not related to each other. The bag dust bacterial and mold content was also consistent across the vacuums we assessed, reaching up to 1E7 bacterial or mold cell equivalents/g. Antibiotic resistance genes were detected in several samples. No archaea or C. botulinum was detected in any air samples. Diversity analyses showed that most bacteria are from human sources, in keeping with other recent results. These results highlight the potential capability of vacuum cleaners to disseminate appreciable quantities of molds and human-associated bacteria indoors and their role as a source of exposure to bioaerosols."

Synthetic drugs are mostly associated with side effects and are generally costly, hence are not affordable to economically poor class of the society when long term treatment is required, thus interest has been developed in the use of herbal medicines which have been reported to have either very little or no side effects. Aims: Present work was carried out to assess the antimicrobial activity of A. paniculata against some multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods: Different parts (leaf, stem, root) of A. paniculata were collected and air dried and soxhlet extracted by using standard methods for flavonoid and alkaloid extraction. These extracts were then tested for antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration, Minimum bactericidal concentration and Total activity were also calculated. Statistical Analysis: Mean value and Standard Deviation were calculated for the test bacteria and fungi. Data were analysed by one-way analysis of variance and P values were considered significant at P < 0.05. Results: C. albicans was found to be the most susceptible organism followed by P. mirabilis, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and A. flavus. A. niger and T. mentegrophyte were observed to be resistant as none of the tested extracts showed activity against them. Free flavonoid extract of root showed best activity against C. albicans (IZ 14 mm, MIC 0.156), whereas leaf free flavonoid extract showed maximum 21 mm inhibition zone against P. mirabilis.The range of MIC and MBC was found to be 1.25-0.039 and 2.5-0.078 respectively. Conclusion: Results of the present study reveal that extracts of A. paniculata are showing great antimicrobial potential against tested microorganisms, and may be exploited for future antimicrobial drugs."

Resistance to multiple antibiotics (multidrug resistance) emerged rapidly given that bacterial species often form a complex community of both drug-resistant and sensitive strains with shared mechanisms of DNA exchange. As such, there is currently a pressing need to find novel approaches to combat their rise whereby no single method is preferentially used. Apart from specific drugs against the infection machinery of microbes, innovative, and cost-effective coating of hospital garments and air filters using antibacterial nanoparticles have been explored.

Legionella spp. are capable of replicating intracellularly within free-living protozoa, and once this has occurred, Legionella is particularly resistant to disinfectants. Citrus essential oil (EO) vapors are effective antimicrobials against a range of microorganisms, with reductions of 5 log cells ml(-1) on a variety of surfaces. The aim of this investigation was to assess the efficacy of a citrus EO vapor against Legionella spp. in water and in soil systems. Reductions of viable cells of Legionella pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella bozemanii, and an intra-amoebal culture of Legionella pneumophila (water system only) were assessed in soil and in water after exposure to a citrus EO vapor at concentrations ranging from 3.75 mg/liter air to 15g/liter air. Antimicrobial efficacy via different delivery systems (passive and active sintering of the vapor) was determined in water, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the antimicrobial components (linalool, citral, and beta-pinene) was conducted. There was up to a 5-log cells ml(-1) reduction in Legionella spp. in soil after exposure to the citrus EO vapors (15 mg/liter air). The most susceptible strain in water was L. pneumophila, with a 4-log cells ml(-1) reduction after 24 h via sintering (15 g/liter air). Sintering the vapor through water increased the presence of the antimicrobial components, with a 61% increase of linalool. Therefore, the appropriate method of delivery of an antimicrobial citrus EO vapor may go some way in controlling Legionella spp. from environmental sources."

It is an interdisciplinary specialty concerned not only with prevention of infectious diseases during travel but also with the personal safety of travelers and the avoidance of environmental risks. The field has evolved as a distinct discipline over the last 2 decades. It is represented by an international society - the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) - and by an active clinical group within the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH). Those who practice in the field come from a wide range of specialty training experiences; however, it is members of the infectious disease community who have frequently taken the lead in providing the evidence base for practice. Accompanying the growth of travel medicine has been a parallel effort in defining a body of knowledge and standards for its practice. These guidelines set forth the minimum standards for knowledge, experience, and practice in travel medicine and review the major content areas in the field. Travel medicine standards are increasingly based on evidence and are moving away from reliance on the opinion of experts. Where possible, recommendations in this document have been graded using the Infectious Diseases Society of America - United States Public Health Service grading system (table 1) [1]. As a young discipline, however, expert opinion and experience still dominate many of the topic areas, highlighting the need for continued investigation in the field. Setting. Most travel medicine care should be performed in a specialized travel clinic by persons who have training in the field, particularly for travelers who have complex itineraries or special health needs (C-III). Primary care physicians and nonspecialists should be able to advise travelers who are in good health and visiting low-risk destinations with standard planned activities. Knowledge base. The knowledge base for the travel medicine provider includes epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of travel-associated infectious diseases; a complete understanding of vaccine indications and procedures; prevention and management of noninfectious travel-associated health risks; and recognition of major syndromes in returned travelers (e.g., fever, diarrhea, and rash) (A-III) (table 2). All providers should access Web-, text-, and journal-based resources. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides authoritative advice on travel health (http://www.cdc.gov/ travel). Competency in travel medicine. Appropriate knowledge and aptitude for practicing travel medicine may be demonstrated by achieving a certificate of knowledge in the field (table 2). Maintaining competency includes ongoing education and performing pretravel consultations on a frequent and regular basis (B-III). Pretravel risk assessment. The key element of the pretravel visit is a health risk assessment of the trip (A-II) (table 3). This balances the health of the traveler (the traveler's age, underlying health conditions, medications, and immunization history) with the details of the planned trip (the season of travel, itinerary, duration, and planned activities). Spectrum of travel medicine advice. Topics of health education and advice that should be covered for all travelers include vaccine-preventable illness, avoidance of insects, malaria chemoprophylaxis (for itineraries that include a malaria risk), prevention and self-treatment of traveler's diarrhea, responsible personal behavior, sexually transmitted infections and safety, travel medical insurance, and access to medical care during travel (A-II) (table 3). Other topics should be covered as indicated by the risk assessment. Consistent and clear advice that is provided in both verbal and written form will help to increase traveler compliance with preventive measures (A-II). The interaction between traveler and health care provider should be collaborative and affords the opportunity to enhance preventive health knowledge. Records and procedures. (1) Permanent records should be maintained for the pretravel visit, including records of traveler demographic data and health history, travel health risk assessment, and immunizations, recommendations, and prescriptions given (A-III) (table 4). (2) Standard procedures for immunization should be followed, including informed consent, vaccine storage, administration, record-keeping, and reporting of adverse events (A-III). Immunization. (I) The pretravel visit should be used to update vaccinations that are routinely recommended according to US schedules and based on the traveler's age and underlying health status (A-I) (table 5). These vaccinations include tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and influenza vaccinations. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B, poliomyelitis, and Neisseria meningitidis may be recommended for travel, as well as for routine health care. (2) Vaccination against yellow fever is usually indicated for travelers to countries in the zone of endemicity for yellow fever (areas in Africa and South America where conditions are conducive to yellow fever transmission) (A-III). In addition, under International Health Regulations (IHRs), some countries that lie within or outside of the zone of endemicity may require yellow fever vaccination as a condition for entry. Recent recognition of serious adverse events associated with yellow fever vaccination requires that a careful risk-benefit assessment be performed before administration of the vaccine. (3) Hepatitis A vaccination should be considered for all travelers (A-III). Booster doses following the primary 2-dose series are not currently recommended (A-II). (4) Vaccination against Japanese encephalitis, rabies, tick-borne encephalitis, and typhoid fever should be administered on the basis of a risk assessment (A-III). Quadrivalent (A/C/ Y/W-135) meningococcal vaccine should be administered to travelers at risk. It is required by Saudi Arabia for religious pilgrims to Mecca for the Hajj or Umrah. Traveler's diarrhea. Traveler's diarrhea is the most common disease among travelers. Management of traveler's diarrhea includes education and advice about prevention, food and liquid hygiene (A-III), and provision for prompt self-treatment in the event of illness (A-I) (table 6). The elements of self-treatment include hydration; treatment with loperamide for control of symptoms, if necessary (when there is no temperature >38.5C or gross blood in the stool); and a short course (single dose to 3 days of therapy) of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (A-I). Antibiotic resistance of enteric pathogens, particularly Campylobacter species, in the destination country needs to be considered. For those travelling to these destinations, as well as for other travelers, azithromycin may be indicated (B-II). Combination treatment with loperamide and an antibiotic may be considered for travelers with moderately severe diarrhea (B-III). Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for most travelers (A-III). Malaria. (I) Malaria is one of the most severe infectious diseases among travelers (tables 7 and 8). Nearly all cases in travelers are preventable. Methods for prevention and best management of malaria include awareness of risk, avoidance of mosquito bites, compliance with chemoprophylaxis, and prompt diagnosis in the event of a febrile illness either during or on return from travel (A-I). When seeking medical care after return from travel, travelers should be instructed to inform their health provider of their travel history. (2) Travelers at risk for malaria should practice the following measures to prevent mosquito bites: wearing of protective clothing to cover exposed skin, application of repellents, and sleeping in areas protected by netting (preferably impregnated with a residual insecticide, such as permethrin) and screens (A-I). Currently, repellents that contain 20%-50% N, N diethylmetatoluamide (DEET) are considered to provide sufficient protection (B-II). (3) The choice of chemoprophylaxis should be made following a careful assessment of malaria risk during the trip. In addition, whether the traveler has contraindications to a particular antimalarial should be considered. (4) The malaria risk assessment includes the itinerary, the species of malaria at the destination (and whether the most severe form of malaria, that due to Plasmodium falciparum, is present and whether it is resistant to chloroquine or other antimalarials), the season of travel, activities, duration, and access to medical care. Consultation with the latest resource information is necessary. Personal safety and environmental heath. (1) All travelers should be aware of personal safety during travel and exercise responsible behavior (A-III). Road and pedestrian safety, risk of blood-borne infections, avoidance of animal bites, awareness of the risk of assault, sexually transmitted infections, and moderation in alcohol use should be discussed. (2) Travelers should understand the effects that air, sea, and land travel, sun, altitude, and heat and cold may have on their health. To prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), long-haul travelers with journeys of 6-8 h and longer should avoid constrictive clothing around their waist and lower extremities, exercise their calf muscles, and maintain hydration (A-III). Travelers with increased risk factors for DVT may consider wearing below-the-knee support stockings (B-II) or receiving low molecular weight heparin (B-I). (3) Ascent to altitudes of 2500-3500 m (8200-11500 feet) is often associated with various forms of high altitude illness. Staged ascent is an effective way to decrease the risk of altitude illness. Travelers who need to ascend rapidly may take acetaxolamide for prevention (B-I).  2006 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved."

In a series of studies of subjects with amalgam fillings, mercury (Hg) levels were followed in saliva, feces, blood, plasma, and urine before and until 60 d after removal of all of the fillings. The Hg concentrations in saliva remained elevated for at least 1 wk, suggesting that dissolved l-Hg vapor is not the major source of mercury in mixed saliva. An absorption phase of Hg was seen in plasma during 24 h after amalgam removal. After 60 d the plasma Hg concentration was reduced to 40\% of the baseline level. The decrease per amalgam surface was 0.11 nmol/l (range 0.02-0.40). The Hg level in feces increased two orders of magnitude two days after amalgam removal. At day 60, the median Hg concentration was still slightly higher than the median value of the amalgam free control group. The resistance patterns of the oral and intestinal microflora in these subjects were also studied. In the intestinal microflora, the relative amount of intestinal microorganisms resistant to 50 muM HgCl2 peaked 7 d after removal of the amalgam fillings, with a median value per sample of 6.1\% compared to 1.3\% in samples collected prior to the Hg exposure. However, no statistical differences in the resistance pattern of the oral microflora were detected between the control and the experimental groups. A number of sensitive kidney function parameters were measured 1 wk before and 1, 2, and 60 after amalgam removal. No effects on the various kidney parameters studied were recorded. According to the conclusions of independent evaluations from different state health agencies, the release of mercury from dental amalgam does not present any non-acceptable risk to the general population."

CAFOs in Iowa have operated under the minimum level of federally required regulations for a number of years. The negative effects of this lack of regulation are starting to take a toll on Iowans. Emerging public health concerns such as air quality and antibiotic resistance, individual health problems, animal welfare concerns, and the basic right to enjoy one's property are becoming controversial issues and demand increased attention from the state's government, courts, and citizens.

The infection begins as a respiratory infection of the trachea, followed by colonization of the air sacs and lungs, from where it invades the blood-stream, leading to infection of the deeper organs (liver, heart, oviduct, and peritoneum). A number of factors play a crucial role in the virulence and pathogenesis of infection. The F1 and P pili are particularly important in establishing the infection at the level of the tracheal epithelium cell. Other important factors are aerobactin, capsule, and serum resistance. Treatment is with antibiotics, but the growing bacterial resistance of avian E. coli and stricter regulations mean that attention is turning to prophylactic, preventative, measures, such as vaccination. Current vaccines provide limited homologous protection against the pathogen. Research is needed to develop a good, broad-spectrum vaccine."

The objective of this study was to assess the activity of PYRRO-C3D against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) biofilms and examine the role of NO in reducing biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance. The activity of PYRRO-C3D on in vitro NTHi biofilms was assessed through CFU enumeration and confocal microscopy. NO release measurements were performed using an ISO-NO probe. NTHi biofilms grown on primary ciliated respiratory epithelia at an air-liquid interface were used to investigate the effects of PYRRO-C3D in the presence of host tissue. Label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) proteomic analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins following NO treatment. PYRRO-C3D specifically released NO in the presence of NTHi, while no evidence of spontaneous NO release was observed when the compound was exposed to primary epithelial cells. NTHi lacking beta-lactamase activity failed to trigger NO release. Treatment significantly increased the susceptibility of in vitro NTHi biofilms to azithromycin, causing a log fold reduction (10-fold reduction or 1-log-unit reduction) in viability (P < 0.05) relative to azithromycin alone. The response was more pronounced for biofilms grown on primary respiratory epithelia, where a 2-log-unit reduction was observed (P < 0.01). Label-free proteomics showed that NO increased expression of 16 proteins involved in metabolic and transcriptional/translational functions. NO release from PYRRO-C3D enhances the efficacy of azithromycin against NTHi biofilms, putatively via modulation of NTHi metabolic activity. Adjunctive therapy with NO mediated through PYRRO-C3D represents a promising approach for reducing biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and outcome of cytomegalovirus infection in a consecutive series of patients with severe steroid refractory colitis admitted to our department from 1997 to 1999. METHODS: Among 62 patients with severe colitis, 55 with ulcerative colitis and seven with Crohn's disease, 19 (30%) were resistant to intravenous steroids and bowel rest. In all of them, rectal biopsies were examined for cytomegalovirus (the flexible proctoscopy being performed without air insufflation and limited to the first 10 cm). Buffy coat preparation on leukocytes was also performed to detect systemic infection. If cytomegalovirus was not detected, cyclosporine was started. RESULTS: In seven (five with ulcerative colitis and two with Crohn's disease) out of 19 (36%) patients with refractory disease, cytomegalovirus was diagnosed in the rectal specimens as well as by buffy coat preparation. Five patients went into remission after antiviral treatment (three with ganciclovir and two with foscarnet). One patient did not respond and was operated on. In one patient, cytomegalovirus was found in the surgical specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Cytomegalovirus infection is a frequent cause of severe refractory colitis.

In order to develop a genomic biomarker, we investigated the response of the mdr49 gene (mdr49) of Drosophila melanogaster to PAHs. Structural analysis of mdr49-PA, which is the putative protein expressed from Drosophila mdr49gene, demonstrated that this transmembrane protein indeed belongs to the adenosine triphosphatebinding cassette transporter superfamily. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR analysis revealed that the mdr49 gene is expressed continuously at all the stages of fly development, including embryos, pupae, larvae, and adults, as well as in embryonic Drosophila S12 cells. In the adult fly, the mdr49 gene was expressed in all the analyzed segments (head, thorax, and abdomen) and organs (olfactory and sexual organs).

Setting.-University-affiliated Veterans Affairs general medical and acute care clinics. Patients.-Consecutive patients with sinus symptoms and radiographic evidence of maxillary sinusitis (complete opacity, air-fluid level, or greater than or equal to 6 mm of mucosal thickening). Patients were excluded for antibiotic use within the past week, TMP/ SMX allergy, symptoms for more than 30 days, or previous sinus surgery. Methods.-All subjects (n=80) received oxymetazoline nasal spray 0.05\%, two sprays twice daily for 3 days. Subjects were randomly assigned to TMP/SMX double strength: one tablet twice daily for 10 days or one tablet twice daily for 3 days followed by 7 days of placebo, At 7 and 14 days, patients rated their overall sinus symptoms on a Likert scale. Radiographs were scored at baseline and 14 days by radiologists masked to clinical symptoms and treatment assignment. The primary outcome was number of days to `'cure'' or `'much improvement'' in sinus symptoms. Patients who were clinical successes by day 14 were assessed for symptomatic relapse or recurrence at 30 and 60 days, respectively, Results.-Groups were comparable at randomization: male, 100\%; black, 53\%; median age, 48 years (interquartile range, 41 to 63 years); symptom duration, 10 days (interquartile range, 6 to 17 days); bilateral maxillary disease, 51\%; and radiograph score, 4 (interquartile range, 2 to 4). Outcome assessment was completed in 95\% of patients at day 14(n=76). Medication side effects and use of nonstudy sinus medications were equal between groups. By 14 days, 77\% of 3D subjects and 76\% of 10D subjects rated their sinus symptoms as cured or much improved (95\% confidence interval for difference, -15\% to 17\%). Median days to cure/much improvement were 5.0 and 4.5 for the 3D and 10D groups, respectively; distributions of time to cure were not different (P=.34). Radiograph scores improved in both groups compared with baseline (2 points; P<.001), but improvement did not differ between groups (P=.31). Eight percent of 3D subjects and 13\% of 10D subjects missed work due to sinus symptoms. Of the 52 patients who were clinical successes at 14 days and completed follow-up, three (11\%) of 27 3D subjects and one (4\%) of 25 10D subjects relapsed symptomatically by day 30; one (4\%) of 27 3D subjects and one (4\%) of 25 10D subjects suffered symptomatic recurrence between days 30 and 60 (P=.45 for the relapse and recurrence rates combined). Conclusion.-At the 2-week follow-up, clinical symptoms and radiograph scores improved equally following 3 or 10 days of TMP/SMX plus oxymetazoline nasal spray. Symptomatic relapse and recurrence were similar between groups. Three days of antibiotics were as effective as 10 days and, because of the high disease prevalence, hold the potential for substantial cost savings."

Here, we consider innovative livestock waste treatment systems in the context of multi-barrier strategies for protecting water quality from agricultural contamination. Specifically, we consider some aspects of how enteric bacterial populations can evolve during manure storage, how their fate following land application of manure can vary according to manure composition, and finally the challenge of distinguishing enteric pathogens of agricultural provenance from those of other sources of fecal pollution at a policy-relevant watershed scale. The beneficial impacts of livestock waste treatment on risk to humans via exposure to manured land are illustrated using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) scenarios. Overall, innovative livestock treatment systems offer a crucially important strategy for making livestock wastes more benign before they are released into the broader environment.

Thus, this study evaluates if this variety has the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities already reported in other varieties. METHODS: C. nucifera aqueous crude extract (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg) and the reference drugs morphine (1 mg/kg) and acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/kg) were evaluated in models of inflammation (formalin-induced licking and subcutaneous air pouch).

The extract was also screened against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in the agar diffusion method. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by the broth micro-dilution assay. Activities of combinations of the extract and antibiotics (methicillin or vancomycin) against MRSA were evaluated using checkerboard assays. RESULTS: The extract significantly inhibited the time that the animals spent licking the formalin-injected paws (second phase). The extract also inhibited the inflammatory process induced by subcutaneous carrageenan injection by reducing cell migration, protein extravasation, and TNF-alpha production. Additionally, the extract showed an antioxidant potential in vitro as good as standards in their antioxidant activity. The extract was active only against S. aureus and MRSA. MIC and the bactericidal concentrations were identical (1,024 mug/ml). The extract and methicillin acted synergistically against the clinical MRSA isolate, whereas an indifferent effect was detected when the extract was combined with vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: The extract exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through the inhibition of the cell migration. The mixture of extract constituents and methicillin could lead to the development of a new combination antibiotic against MRSA infections."

Responses to greater than 500 mM H2O2 were transient. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors blocked the H2O2 response, as did EP1 and EP4 receptor antagonists. Amultidrug-resistant protein (MRP) inhibitor and short hairpin RNA directed against MRP4 blocked H2O2 responses. EP1 and EP4 agonists mimicked H2O2 in both control and MRP4 knockdown cells.

The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus warneri, which belong to normal human skin flora, but can also be the cause of common and even severe nosocomial infections. Disk diffusion tests showed that the bacterial strains were most frequently resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline and only 18% of strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific gene regions was used to determine the presence of the Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin resistance mechanisms in CoNS. The molecular analysis, conducted using specific primer pairs, identified the msrA1 gene, encoding active efflux pumps in bacterial cells, as the most frequent resistance gene. As many as seven antibiotic resistance genes were found in one isolate, whereas the most common number of resistance genes per isolate was five (n = 17). It may be concluded that drug resistance was widely spread among the tested strains, but the resulting antimicrobial resistance profile indicates that in the case of infection, the use of antibiotics from the basic antibiogram group will be effective in therapy.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of this bacterium was evaluated. METHOD: Subgingival samples were taken using sterilized absorbent paper points. Spittoon samples were collected using sterile swabs around the drain area with shut off, and air-water syringe samples by washing the tip with Ringer solution. Samples were transferred in tubes under CO2 flux. Diluted samples were inoculated on to Omata and Disraely agar and blood agar plates, which were incubated in anaerobiosis, at 37 degrees C, for 4 days. Bacterial species were identified biochemically. MIC was determined using an agar dilution method. RESULTS: Periodontal patients, healthy subjects, spittoons and air-water syringes were 80%, 67.6%, 37.8% and 3.3% positive to Fusobacterium, respectively. Clindamycin, imipenem, lincomycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were active against all human and environmental isolates. Eighteen isolates resistant to ampicillin or penicillin G produced beta-lactamases. The presence of human oral bacteria in items of dental equipment supports the hypothesis that such equipment may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of pathogenic organisms.

A chronological view","Japanese Journal of Chemotherapy","53","1","?",NA,"The classical term ""pneumonia"" was first noted by Hippocrates in the 4th century BC, as a serious illness in the thorax. In 1819, Laennec recorded the physical findings of chest abnormalities obtained by percussion and auscultation with the stethoscope he invented, and compared them with the post mortem findings. Then, the pneumonia and pneumonic consolidation, were differentiated from pleural effusion, and the criteria for pneumonia were classified anatomically into lobar and lobular pneumonia. The causative bacteria of infectious diseases, including pneumonia, were discovered in late the 19th century. This fact induced at least three important things, 1 evidence that pneumonia is clearly caused by invasion of microorganisms into lung through airway or blood stream. 2 analysis of serotyping of bacterial capsules of pneumococci led to development of type specific serotherapy and 3 synthesis of chemotherapeutic agents based on the idea that dyestuffs enter bacterial bodies. In the 1920s-1930s, along with increasing popularity of type specific serotherapy, an accurate determination of the causative organisms was attached importance to diagnosis of pneumonia, because the Type specific serotherapy was only the way to get a favorable prognosis of the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. At the same time, bacteriology-based diagnosis, such as ""pneumococcal pneumonia"", became more popular than anatomy-based diagnosis. Such an active observation toward the bacteriologic examination, on the other hand, led to postulation of the existence of a different type of pneumonia, ""atypical pneumonia"", whose causative organisms were speculated to be viruses or transfilterable agents. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1962), Legionella pneumophila (1976), Chlamydia pneumoniae (1980s) and SARS-Co-V (2002) were later discovered. In the late 20th century, the incidence of opportunistic pneumonia increased in association with the aging of society and the increased longevity of immunodeficient patients. Also, the incidence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia re-emerged, parallel with the spread of HIV infection, and pneumonia caused by antibacterial agent resistant strains, for instance MRSA or PRSP emerged. In this situation, a new concept of the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) was populariged (1980s). Since the point of this criteria was well reflected the correlation between preference for the causative organisms and the patients background, this classification was convenient for the choice of antimicrobial agent based on empirical evidence. Recently, however, the close relationship between pathogens and patient background has sometimes became unclear, because patients with immunodeficiency diseases, patients with chronic intractable diseases and elderly patients are increasingly living in community. It indicates that the terminology of CAP or HAP has to reconsider to go back the starting point. Although the purulent exacerbation of chronic bronchitis was postulated by the infection with numerous microorganisms, the bacterial analysis of chronic bronchitis remained incomplete until 1940s. In the 1950s, a significant role of Haemophilus influenzae was prevailed. A resurgence of interest in chronic bronchitis was stimulated by the increasing incidence of the disease in association with widespread air pollution, particularly in industrial areas and in big cities. In addition, infected cystic fibrosis and infected diffuse panbronchiolitis were recognized as intractable airway infections with persistant colonization of bacterial biofilms. A therapeutic effect of long term use of 14 or 15 membered macrolides for diffuse panbronchiolitis was indicated. Multifaceted basic studies on approach to possible mechanisms of the macrolide effect was performed. Interestingly, an autoimmune factor, BPI-ANCA, was detected in the patients with chronic infection of cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis, and stimulated an interesting assignment on the thinking of correlation between autoimmune factors and chronic infection. Moreover, biofilm research developed the quorum sensing system in bacterial communication. The inhibition of this system is thought a key-role in suppression of biofilm formation, which often causes a persistent infection of the airway. Furanone compounds and 14 or 15 membered macrolides are investigating as the role of quorum sensing inhibitors. Along the chronological advancement concerning with microorganisms, clinical features and therapeutic methods, the respiratory infections were reviewed. There were numerous contributions in the history of respiratory infections. What I want to emphasize is that everyone worked in each generation possessed his own knowledge, his own insight, and his own enthusiam."

The susceptibility of isolated staphylococci was assessed with the disc-diffusion method, following the recommendations of the EUCAST. The results indicate that the microbial population in the air of the investigated area was dominated by mold fungi, whose highest average concentration was recorded at site IV located near the final clarifier (7672 CFUm-3). Heterotrophic bacteria and mannitol-positive staphylococci were the most numerous at locations where sewage undergoes primary treatment. In each subseuqent stage the number of microorganisms emitted into the air from the sewage was lower. Antibiograms show that more than 50% of Staphylococcus spp. exhibited resistance to penicillin and 20% to rifampicin. In addition, 90% of the analyzed strains were sensitive to other antibiotics. The fungal community included the following genera: Cladosporium, Fusarium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, and Acremonium.The highest air contamination with all studied groups of microorganisms was recorded at the locations where mechanical sewage treatment was performed.

We argue that the only way to stop the transmission of this airborne disease is to treat the mine and its living quarters as one should any other congregate setting with individuals who have high rates of infection with drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. This means implementing interventions that have been demonstrated to stop the spread of tuberculosis over the last 60 years: immediate treatment of active tuberculosis, concurrent treatment of latent tuberculosis disease to reduce the burden of active cases, and appropriate management of patients infected with HIV.

Questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. Methods: Catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35degreesC in air. Test organisms included American Type Culture Collection strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days (two catheter segments per test). Colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). In addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). Results: Inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with S aureus, S epidermidis, E faecalis, and E coli. Growth of P aeruginosa was not inhibited by CVC segments. Testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from CVC segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, S aureus vs rifampin). Recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between CVC exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. Conclusions: Our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of Gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. However, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. Clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance."

This characteristic questions the contribution of this phenotype to an increased risk of clinical infections by this pathogen. Methodology/Principal Findings: By a proteomic approach using 2-D gel electrophoresis-LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry, we compared the membrane protein patterns of A. baumannii 77, a pellicle-forming clinical isolate, grown in planktonic and in sessile modes. We identified 52 proteins with a differential expression, including 32 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated in the pellicle state. Several proteins, differentially expressed during pellicle development, were of particular interest. We determined the over-expression of four siderophore iron uptake systems including the acinetobactin and enterobactin receptors and confirmed that the development of this type of biofilm is promoted by ferric ions. Two over-expressed proteins, CarO and an OprD-homologue, putative carbapenem-resistance associated porins, would be involved in the transport of specific compounds, like ornithine, a biosynthesis precursor of a siderophore from the hydroxamate family. We evidenced the overexpression of a lipase and a transporter of LCFA that may be involved in the recycling of lipids inside the pellicle matrix. Finally, we demonstrated both by proteomic and by AFM studies that this particular type of biofilm required multiple pili systems to maintain this cohesive structure at the air-liquid interface; two of these systems have never been described in A. baumannii. Conclusions/Significance: Our study demonstrated that several proteins, overexpressed at a late state of pellicle development, could be potentially involved in virulence processes. Therefore, regarding the number of potential virulence factors that are over-expressed in this growth mode, the pellicle-forming clinical isolates should be kept under survey."

By using an experimental system we evaluated the effect of PM2.5 exposure on susceptibility to subsequent pulmonary Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection and its potential mechanisms. Rats were intratracheally instilled with a single dose of PM2.5 sample or PBS followed by an intratracheal inoculation with bacteria S. aureus at 24h after PM2.5 exposure. The rats were examined at 24h post infection. We found that exposure of rats to PM2.5 significantly increased inflammatory cells and levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). Prior PM2.5 exposure markedly increased the susceptibility of rats to subsequent S. aureus infection. The mechanistic studies showed that alveolar macrophages (AMs) from PM2.5-experienced lungs had depressed phagocytosis of S. aureus, and prior PM2.5 exposure significantly decreased the natural killer (NK) cells recruited into the airways following subsequent S. aureus infection. Further, adoptive transfer of naive NK cells to the lung of prior PM2.5-exposed rats restored PM2.5-impaired antibacterial host defense. The presence of NK cells markedly enhanced the ability of AMs to phagocytose S. aureus ex vivo. Thus, our study identifies PM2.5-impaired NK cell response in the lung to be a novel critical mechanism for PM2.5-mediated susceptibility to S. aureus bacterial infection, which provides a potential mechanism to explain the epidemiological findings that associate ambient air pollution and increased lung bacterial infections. Our findings also suggest that enhancing pulmonary NK cells may be considered for future therapeutic approaches to clinically antibiotic-resistant S. aureus infection in the lung."

Although the strains of S. aureus found in the air, and those colonizing the noses of patients, in the protected section could seldom be related to patients nursed elsewhere in the ward, the mechanical ventilation did not lead to any significant reduction in the degree of contamination of the air or in the rate of nasal acquisition of S. aureus.Even in the protected section, nearly 20% of the strains of S. aureus recovered from the air could not be related to known nasal carriers. Since this proportion was nearly as great as that found in the absence of directed air-flow, it seems probable that these strains were derived either from undetected sources within the section or were dispersed from the clothes of persons who entered it.Nearly one-third of the nasal acquisitions in the ward could not be related to known nasal carriers, but about one-half of these (16%) were probably ;spurious' and half of the remainder (8%) could be related to strains recovered from patients' lesions or drawsheets, leaving no more than 8% unaccounted for. A short investigation in which both drawsheet and perineal samples were examined showed that drawsheet samples did not give a reliable indication of perineal carriage unassociated with nasal carriage.During the period of the investigation, a single strain of S. aureus that was resistant to a wide range of antibiotics established itself in the ward. The most notable character of this strain was the profuse dispersion of it by carriers. As a consequence, staphylococcal wound sepsis increased, with nearly three-quarters of the infections attributable to this strain, and nasal carrier rates increased with length of stay in the ward, over 20% of patients who stayed 5-6 weeks acquiring the strain."

This study evaluated the occurrence of -lactamase-positive subgingival bacteria in chronic periodontitis subjects of USA origin, and assessed their in vitro resistance to metronidazole at a breakpoint concentration of 4g/mL. Material and Methods Subgingival plaque specimens from deep periodontal pockets with bleeding on probing were removed from 564 adults with severe chronic periodontitis before treatment. The samples were transported in VMGA III and then plated onto: (i) nonselective enriched Brucella blood agar (EBBA) and incubated anaerobically for 7d; and (ii) selective trypticase soy-bacitracin-vancomycin (TSBV) and incubated for 3 d in air + 5\% CO2. At the end of the incubation periods, the bacterial test species were identified and quantified. Specimen dilutions were also plated onto EBBA plates supplemented with 2g/mL of amoxicillin, a combination of 2g/mL of amoxicillin plus 2g/mL of the -lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, or 4g/mL of metronidazole, followed by anaerobic incubation for 7d. Bacterial test species presumptively positive for -lactamase production were identified by growth on EBBA primary isolation plates supplemented with amoxicillin alone and no growth on EBBA primary isolation plates containing both amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. A subset of such isolates was subjected to nitrocefin-based chromogenic disk testing to confirm the presence of -lactamase activity. In vitro resistance to 4g/mL of metronidazole was noted when growth of test species occurred on metronidazole-supplemented EBBA culture plates. Results Two-hundred and ninety-four (52.1\%) of the study subjects yielded -lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial test species, with Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and other Prevotella species most frequently identified as -lactamase-producing organisms. Of the -lactamase-producing bacterial test species strains recovered, 98.9\% were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole at 4g/mL. Conclusion The occurrence of -lactamase-positive subgingival bacterial species in more than half of the subjects with severe chronic periodontitis raises questions about the therapeutic potential of single-drug regimens with -lactam antibiotics in periodontal therapy. The in vitro effectiveness of metronidazole against nearly all recovered -lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial species further supports clinical periodontitis treatment strategies involving the combination of systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole."

For shigella cases Ankara had seasonal alterations in July and August being the peak months. Americans, disease followed that course exactly. The big difference was being the local people of the city had those epidemics with the flexneri strains but Americans had them with the sonnei strains. To show the possible sources which could infect the community time to time and make sonnei predominant yielded negative result. All the patients stools were cultured. Sensitivity studies employing ""plate disk diffusion"" techniques were done. All patients treated accordingly. Stools checked for routine carriership exams. None become a chronic carrier. American installations had their shops, clubs, mess halls. The food handlers of these places had checked routinely by the preventive medicine office. None found infected. Only at 1963 the amount of flexneri isolations were higher than sonnei. All the remaining years sonnei were predominant. Antibiotic sensitivity studies showed no differences between subtypes. Except streptomycin and sulphamide strains stayed fairly sensitive to other antibiotics. Resistance factors contained maximum 6 markers. The little Americans community in Ankara consisted a unique and highly socioeconomic-wise developed group of the city. Many attempts to find the answer for the question is ""who is infecting who"" was always fruitless. That gives the impression as if the Americans were more sensitive to the shigella infections caused by sonnei strains for some reason. In another words Americans were more resistant to the infections other than sonnei."

To evaluate filamentous fungi with respect to environmental load and potential drug resistance in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Design. Monthly survey in 2 buildings of the hospital during a 12-month period. Setting. Hippokration Hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece. Methods. Air, surface, and tap water sampling was performed in 4 departments with high-risk patients. As sampling sites, the solid-organ transplantation department and the hematology department ( in the older building) and the pediatric oncology department and the pediatric intensive care unit ( in the newer building) were selected. Results. From January to May of 2000, the fungal load in air ( FLA) was low, ranging from 0 to 12 colony-forming units (cfu) per m(3) in both buildings. During the summer months, when high temperature and humidity predominate, the FLA increased to 4-56 cfu/m(3). The fungi commonly recovered from culture of air specimens were Aspergillus niger ( 25.9\%), Aspergillus flavus ( 17.7\%), and Aspergillus fumigatus ( 12.4\%). Non-Aspergillus filamentous fungi, such as Zygomycetes and Dematiaceous species, were also recovered. The pediatric intensive care unit had the lowest mean FLA ( 7.7 cfu/m(3)), compared with the pediatric oncology department ( 8.7 cfu/m(3)), the solid-organ transplantation department (16.1 cfu/m(3)), and the hematology department ( 22.6 cfu/m(3)). Environmental surfaces were swabbed, and 62.7\% of the swab samples cultured yielded filamentous fungi similar to the fungi recovered from air but with low numbers of colony-forming units. Despite vigorous sampling, culture of tap water yielded no fungi. The increase in FLA observed during the summer coincided with renovation in the building that housed the solid-organ transplantation and hematology departments. All 54 Aspergillus air isolates randomly selected exhibited relatively low minimum inhibitory or effective concentrations for amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, micafungin, and anidulafungin. Conclusion. Air and surface fungal loads may vary in different departments of the same hospital, especially during months when the temperature and humidity are high. Environmental Aspergillus isolates are characterized by lack of resistance to clinically important antifungal agents."

Even though several effective antifungal agents are available for oral candida infections, the failure is not uncommon because isolates of Candida albicans may exhibits resistance to the drug during therapy. The present study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of few plant extracts on Candida albicans. An additional objective was to identify an alternative, inexpensive, simple, and effective method of preventing and controlling Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fine texture powder or paste form of leaves was soaked in sterile distilled water and 100% ethyl alcohol, which were kept in refrigerator at 4 degrees C for 24 h. Then filtrates were prepared and kept in a hot air oven to get a black shining crystal powder/paste form. Stock solutions of plant extracts were inoculated on petri plates containing species of Candida albicans and incubated at 25 +/- 2 degrees C for 72 h. RESULTS: Alcoholic curry leaves showed the maximum zone of inhibition on Candida albicans followed by aqueous tea leaves. The other plant extracts like alcoholic onion leaves, alcoholic tea leaves, alcoholic onion bulb, alcoholic aloe vera, and alcoholic mint leaves also inhibited the growth of Candida albicans but lesser extent.

The numerical modeling deployed steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with a rotating reference frame to simulate the rotation of fan blades. CFD was validated with experimental data of velocity field and fraction of microorganism remaining at the exhaust diffuser. The fraction of microorganism remaining represented the ratio of the concentration of airborne microorganisms measured with UVGI turned on to the one measured with UVGI turned off. According to the validation results, the CFD model correctly reproduced the air movement induced by the rotation of ceiling fan. When the ambient ventilation rate was 2 ACH (air changes per hour) or 6 ACH, the CFD model accurately predicted the average vertical speeds in the section 2.44 m above the floor with the errors less than 10\%, regardless of the ceiling fan's rotational direction or speed. In addition, the simulation results showed that the fraction of microorganism remaining increased with the ambient air exchange rate when the fan blew air downward with a rotational speed as high as 235 rpm, which corresponded with the experimental results. Furthermore, the simulation results accurately predicted the fraction of microorganism remaining when the ambient air exchange rate was 2 ACH. We conclude that this novel numerical model can reproduce the effects of ceiling fans and UR-UVGI fixtures on indoor environment, and should aid in the investigation of the impact of ceiling fans on UR-UVGI disinfection efficacy.

Tests for the detection of methicillin resistance, indicating resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics, were evaluated in order to define a suitable screening test. A broth tube breakpoint test with a large inoculum, 107 colony forming units (cfu), gave the highest recovery of resistant strains. False resistance due to hyperproduction of beta-lactamase was excluded. The results correlated completely with the detection of the resistance gene, mecA, by the polymerase chain reaction. In 2/3 of the resistant strains tested the expression of the methicillin resistance was heterogeneous, only one cell in 10(2) to 10(4) expressed the resistance within 72 h in broth. In broth screening tests an inoculum of at least 10(6) cfu therefore was required to detect all resistant strains within 24 h. Using agar dilution, 48 h incubation must be considered. In disc diffusion tests reliable results were obtained after only 16 h of incubation when discs containing cephradine 5 and 30 mug, oxacillin 1 mug or cephalexin 30 gg were used, and the first disc is recommended for routine work. The epidemiology of S. epidermidis strains resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or gentamicin was studied in an isolation unit for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Antibiograms and plasmids were used for typing and 31 such strains were found. Of 54 staff members 10 were colonized in the nares only, two in the nares and perineum and one in the nares and stool. In ambient air and on the clothes of staff a few of the strains predominated quantitatively. These strains colonized the skin of some of the patients who seemed to be the main dispersers. Possible routes of cross-infection were indirect contact transfer via the hands and clothes of staff (82\% of the clothes were contaminated), and direct as well as indirect airborne transmission. To study the effects of chlorhexidine on skin bacteria, ten nurses washed one arm with chlorhexidine-detergent every morning for 3 weeks; the other arm served as control. The depression of the normal skin flora did nol lead to a colonization with more antibiotic-resistant hospital strains. During the wash period the counts of antibiotic-resistant S. epidermidis on the treated arms were significantly reduced compared with the control arms, as also were the number of different strains. However, some antibiotic-resistant strains could not be eradicated from the arms with chlorhexidine-detergent, probably because they colonized deeper layers of the skin. Many strains were only transient skin colonizers. In an experimental study, strains of S. epidermidis were inoculated on the skin of volunteers.

However, effects of organic animal husbandry on food safety have not been rigorously tested especially in meat turkey flocks. This study provides for the first time an overview on the prevalence and genetic diversity of Campylobacter species (spp.) in five organic meat turkey farms located in different regions in Germany, as well as on potential risk factors of bacterial spreading. Thirty cloacal swabs as well as water samples and darkling beetles were collected from each flock and examined for the presence of Campylobacter by conventional and molecular biological methods. The isolates were genotyped by flaA-RFLP. Results: Campylobacter spp. were detected in cloacal swabs in all 5 turkey flocks with prevalence ranged from 90.0 to 100 \%. 13 cloacal swabs collected from birds in farm III and IV were harboured mixed population of thermophilic campylobacters. In total, from 158 Campylobacter isolated from turkeys 89 (56.33 \%) were identified as C. coli and 69 (43.76 \%) as C. jejuni. Three Campylobacter (2 C. jejuni and 1 C. coli) were detected in drinkers of two farms and 3 C. coli were isolated from darkling beetles of one farm. No Campylobacter were isolated from main water tanks. flaA-RFLP assay showed that turkey farms can harbour more than one genotype. In a single turkey two different genotypes could be detected. The genotypes of campylobacters isolated from water samples or beetles were identical with those isolated from turkeys. No effect was found of some environmental parameters {[}ammonia concentration (NH3), carbon dioxide concentration (CO2), relative humidity (RH) and air temperature)] on Campylobacter prevalence in organic turkey farms. Additionally, drinking water and darkling beetles might be considered as risk factors for the spreading of Campylobacter in turkey flocks. Conclusions: This study highlights the high prevalence and genotypic diversity of Campylobacter spp. isolated from organic turkey flocks. Further research is needed to assess other potential risk factors responsible for bacteria spreading in order to mitigate the spread of Campylobacter in organic turkey flocks by improving biosecurity control measures."

The engineering control measures available include ventilation dilution, use of high-efficiency particulate air filters in a room or in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, and use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices in ceiling area of a room or in the HVAC system. These methods are known to be effective in controlling or delaying airborne disease transmission in a single enclosure in both healthcare facilities and the community. However, there have been no studies of their relative effectiveness at the community level. This paper presents mathematical modeling of some engineering control strategies with a focus on ventilation and corresponding analysis of their relative effectiveness compared with other public health interventions in disease control in indoor environments at the community level. The results should help us to determine the most effective intervention strategies. We conclude that the engineering intervention methods such as building ventilation can be as effective as public health interventions and the ventilation rates specified in the existing standards such as ASHRAE 62 may be too low for the purpose of preventing or controlling airborne infectious diseases in indoor environments."

Biofilm mode of growth facilitates its survival in a variety of environments. Most P. aeruginosa isolates, including the non-mucoid laboratory strain PA14, are able to form a thick pellicle, which results in a surface-associated biofilm at the air-liquid (A-L) interface in standing liquid cultures. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are considered as key components in the formation of this biofilm pellicle. In the non-mucoid P. aeruginosa strain PA14, the ``scaffolding{''} polysaccharides of the biofilm matrix, and the molecules responsible for the structural integrity of rigid A-L biofilm have not been identified. Moreover, the role of LPS in this process is unclear, and the chemical structure of the LPS O-antigen of PA14 has not yet been elucidated. Principal Findings: In the present work we carried out a systematic analysis of cellular and extracellular (EC) carbohydrates of P. aeruginosa PA14. We also elucidated the chemical structure of the LPS O-antigen by chemical methods and 2-D NMR spectroscopy. Our results showed that it is composed of linear trisaccharide repeating units, identical to those described for P. aeruginosa Lanyi type O:2a,c (Lanyi-Bergman O-serogroup 10a, 10c; IATS serotype 19) and having the following structure: -4)-alpha-L-GalNAcA-(1-3)-alpha-D-QuiNAc-(1-3)-alpha-L-Rha-(1-. Furthermore, an EC O-antigen polysaccharide (EC O-PS) and the glycerol-phosphorylated cyclic beta-(1,3)-glucans were identified in the culture supernatant of PA14, grown statically in minimal medium. Finally, the extracellular matrix of the thick biofilm formed at the A-L interface contained, in addition to eDNA, important quantities (at least similar to 20\% of dry weight) of LPS-like material. Conclusions: We characterized the chemical structure of the LPS O-antigen and showed that the O-antigen polysaccharide is an abundant extracellular carbohydrate of PA14. We present evidence that LPS-like material is found as a component of a biofilm matrix of P. aeruginosa."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus in the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH). A total of 200 samples were collected from the floor, walls, air and inanimate objects in different wards of the KTH, during May 2012 to September 2012. These samples were screened for the recovery of S. aureus. Recovered organisms were subjected to susceptibility testing and investigated for the detection of various toxin and antibiotic resistance genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A total of 64 samples yielded S. aureus, out of which 37 (57.81\%) were proved as MRSA. No isolate was found resistant to Vancomycin, however 81.25\% of the isolates were found susceptible to Linezolid and Amikacin. The susceptibility to Fusidic acid, Chloramphenicol, Rifampicin, Doxycycline and Meropenem was observed as 79.69\%, 76.56\%, 75.00, 73.44\% and 68.75\% respectively. The frequency of sea, seb and sec genes were 56.25\%, 43.75\% and 12.5\% in the recovered isolates. Erm C was more prevalent (28.12 \%) than the ermA and ermB. The prevalence of pvl in MRSA was 21.62 \% which is less than 33.33\% in the MSSA isolates. S. aureus and especially MRSA are frequently prevalent in the KTH. Therefore, every immune-compromised patient is prone to infections caused by S. aureus.

Antibiotic-loaded cement spacers improve patient mobility and maintain stability of the joint as well as length of the limb. Prefabricated spacers are readily available but lack adaptability. We developed modular moulds separately for stem and head to create more individual spacers with optimised femoral press-fit and smooth head surface. METHODS: Moulds are fabricated preoperatively by forming 4 mm polyethylene over trial stems and cups under vacuum (MS 30, Centerpulse, Switzerland). After gas sterilization, Refobacin Palacos (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) is poured into stem and head moulds of appropriate size. A double K-wire is inserted as a rod. Fluoroscopy is used to check for air inclusions, which might impair resistance. For mechanical resistance testing trials, 5 spacers were resin-fixed with 80% stem insertion and loaded in a craniocaudal direction at 20 N/s (universal testing machine, Zwick, Germany) until failure. RESULTS: The static testing showed an average failure load of 1550 N (range 1350-2000 N). The K-wires prevented complete dislocation of the fragments. CONCLUSION: Partial weight-bearing is possible with this system, but a fall might lead to an acute fracture. New materials for the core can be tested with our biomechanical model. Following the presented craniocaudal static testing, torsion testing and dynamic testing in Ringer's solution are planned."

The authors presented a case of rare AOM complication - zygomatic abscess with temporal myositis. A 6-year-old boy was admitted to the ENT Department with 4 weeks of ear pain, treated for AOM with cefuroxime axetyl and amoxicilline, with acute mastoiditis and subsequent abscess formation in zygomatic and preauricular region. The inflammatory process spread through anterior air cells to the zygomatic cells leading to a fistula formation in the zygomatic bone and breakthrough into the temporal muscle. The surgical procedures applied were: myringotomy with drainage, cortical mastoidectomy and revision of zygomatic area and treatment with antibiotics (ceftriaxon). Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus viridans were found in the culture of middle ear and mastoid effusion. After half a year of follow-up the child had a normal hearing. Severe complications of AOM are rare today. An early diagnosis in order to promote adequate management and prevent inherently suppurative complications is essential. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The commonest class of antibiotics used to treat staphylococcal infections is the beta-lactams. Frequently, S. aureus strains show high resistance to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, called ``Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus{''} (MRSA). Although MRSA has emerged at slower rate in domestic animals, it has frequently been found in the nasal cavity of healthy piglets and its transmission between pigs and swine handlers has already been studied. The aim of this work was to assess the presence of MRSA in finishing pigs in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Materials, Methods \& Results: A total of 350 nasal swabs were collected from 10 to 20 week old finishing pigs. Sampling was performed in five pig farms in northeast Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. Swabs were stored in tubes without transport medium and carried to the laboratory under refrigeration. The specimens were cultured in selective and differential Agar (Baird Parker) and then were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. After isolation of typical colonies of S. aureus, they were inoculated in BHI (Brain Heart Infusion) broth at 37 degrees C for 24 h and tested for tube coagulase activity. Coagulase positive samples were selected for growth in Oxacillin Resistant Screening Agar (ORSA) supplemented with 2 mg/ L of oxacillin. This media contains aniline blue to demonstrate mannitol fermentation. Oxacillin and 5.5\% NaCl have the capacity to reduce the growth of non-staphylococcal bacteria, selecting for MRSA. Blue colonies growth after 24 to 48 h of incubation at 37 degrees C indicate the presence of positive MRSA strains. Specimens with at least one colony growing in ORSA within 48 h were considered resistant. Linear regression was performed in order to identify the association between herd size and MRSA frequency (SAS 9.4, 2012). Growth of S. aureus occurred on 18.0\% of the samples and differences among farms were found. However, after incubation in ORSA only 18 (5.1\%) were MRSA positive, ranging from zero to 12.5\% among farms. Significant correlation between herd size and MRSA frequency (adjusted r(2) = 0.978; P = 0.001) was observed. Discussion: In a previous study in pig herds in Brazil examining swine nasal swabs, 22.5\% was positive for S. aureus and none for MRSA. One of 5 farms tested in our work also had no positive animals and 4 of them showed low frequencies, ranging from 1.7\% to 12.5\% with an average of 5.1\%. Our results were similar to those found in Asian countries, but were very different from European data. Some factors can be associated with MRSA frequency in pig farms, such as dust, air contamination, poor hygiene, age, herd size, replacement rate and number of sources. In the present work we found a strong positive correlation (r(2) adjusted = 0.978; P = 0.001) between herd size and MRSA frequency, such as detected by previous authors. It might occur due to a higher risk of bacterial introduction and higher pressure of infection, easing dissemination of MRSA. Herd size may be a crucial factor to explain the frequencies found, since farms had very similar facilities and handling practices. Although the average frequency has been low in this work when compared to other countries, MRSA was present in almost all farms. This bacteria is able to transmit mecA gene to S. aureus susceptible populations, increasing MRSA frequencies over time."

Although improving ventilation may reduce transmission, there is a lack of evidence to support low-cost practical interventions. We assessed the efficacy of wind-driven roof turbines to achieve recommended ventilation rates, compared to current recommended practices for natural ventilation (opening windows), in primary care clinic rooms in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Methods: Room ventilation was assessed (CO2 gas tracer technique) in 4 rooms where roof turbines and air-intake grates were installed, across three scenarios: turbine, grate and window closed, only window open, and only turbine and grate open, with concurrent wind speed measurement. 332 measurements were conducted over 24 months. Findings: For all 4 rooms combined, median air changes per hour (ACH) increased with wind speed quartiles across all scenarios. Higher median ACH were recorded with open roof turbines and grates, compared to open windows across all wind speed quartiles. Ventilation with open turbine and grate exceeded WHO-recommended levels (60 Litres/second/patient) for 95\% or more of measurements in 3 of the 4 rooms; 47\% in the remaining room, where wind speeds were lower and a smaller diameter turbine was installed. Conclusion: High room ventilation rates, meeting recommended thresholds, may be achieved using wind-driven roof turbines and grates, even at low wind speeds. Roof turbines and air-intake grates are not easily closed by staff, allowing continued ventilation through colder periods. This simple, low-cost technology represents an important addition to our tools for TB infection control."

NO beta-lactamase production was detected. However, some B. wadsworthia strains may grow as a heavy ""haze"" at up to the highest concentration of an antibiotic on standard antimicrobial agent-containing plates, and it is often difficult to determine the point at which conventional growth stops and haze growth begins. We investigated the nature of the haze growth of B. wadsworthia by using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as an indicator of viability during antimicrobial susceptibility testing, by determining viability counts on antimicrobial agent-containing plates at various times, and by microscopically inspecting stained preparations of the growth on the control plate and the haze area. TTC MICs were determined by applying a TTC solution over the growth on plates inside the anaerobic chamber or within 5 min after exposure to air (aerobic TTC MICs). The haze growth reduced TTC in the chamber but not under aerobic conditions, whereas TTC was reduced by the conventional growth in both atmospheres. The aerobic TTC MICs correlated with the viability counts. Separated proteins resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing showed TTC-reactive bands only when stained under anaerobic conditions, further demonstrating the sensitivity of TTC reduction to aerobic conditions. Microscopic examination of the haze growth indicated spheroplast formation. A new antibiogram for B. wadsworthia has been established by use of aerobic TTC endpoints; we believe that the lower MICs obtained with the TTC method are likely the ones that are clinically relevant and should be used in tests of B. wadsworthia. Also, we found that when the organisms were grown on pyruvate-containing medium, 87% of 56 strains tested were Beta-lactamase positive."

Growth of E. coll. occurred in 54 samples. Successful cultivation was achieved in samples from as early as 1994. The frequency of detection increased from earlier to later time periods, but the concentrations, which ranged between 3.4 x 10(2) and 1.1 x 10(5) colony-forming units per gram, did not correlate with sample age (Spearman rank correlation; p > 0.05). We hypothesize that E. coil cells survived in dust samples without cell division because of the storage conditions. Dry material (dust) with low water activities (arithmetic mean 0.6) and storage at 40 degrees C in the dark likely facilitated long-term survival. E. coil were isolated on MacConkey agar with and without ciprofloxacin supplementation. For 110 isolates (79 from non-supplemented media and 31 from supplemented media), we determined the E. coil phylotype and antimicrobial resistance. Six phylogenetic groups were identified. Phylogroups A and B1 predominated. Compared to group A. phylogroup B1 was significantly associated with growth on ciprofloxacin-supplemented media (chi-square test, p = 0.003). Furthermore, the antibiotic resistance profiles determined by a microdilution method revealed that isolates were phenotypically resistant to at least one antimicrobial substance and that more than 50\% were resistant to a minimum of five out of 10 antibiotics tested. A linear mixed model was used to identify factors associated with the number of phenotypic resistances of individual isolates. Younger isolates and isolates from fattening poultry barns tended to be resistant to significantly more antibiotics than older isolates and those from laying-hen houses (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Sample origin and storage conditions may have influenced the number of antimicrobial resistances. Overall, we found that under particular conditions, dust from farm animal houses can be reservoirs for antimicrobial-resistant E. coil for at least 20 years. The survival strategies that allow E. coil to survive such long periods in environmental samples are not fully understood and could be an interesting research topic for future studies."

One of the risk factors for such infection is bacterial contamination of operating rooms' and surgical wards' indoor air. In view of that, the microbiological quality of air can be considered as a mirror of the hygienic condition of these rooms. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the bacterial load and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates in operating rooms' and surgical wards' indoor air of Jimma University Specialized Hospital. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted to measure indoor air microbial quality of operating rooms and surgical wards from October to January 2009/2010 on 108 indoor air samples collected in twelve rounds using purposive sampling technique by Settle Plate Method (Passive Air Sampling following 1/1/1 Schedule). Sample processing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done following standard bacteriological techniques. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 and interpreted according to scientifically determined baseline values initially suggested by Fisher. RESULTS: The mean aerobic colony counts obtained in OR-1(46cfu/hr) and OR-2(28cfu/hr) was far beyond the set 5-8cfu/hr acceptable standards for passive room. Similarly the highest mean aerobic colony counts of 465cfu/hr and 461cfu/hr were observed in Female room-1 and room-2 respectively when compared to the acceptable range of 250-450cfu/hr. In this study only 3 isolates of S. pyogenes and 48 isolates of S. aureus were identified. Over 66% of S. aureus was identified in Critical Zone of Operating rooms. All isolates of S. aureus showed 100% and 82.8% resistance to methicillin and ampicillin respectively.

We examined the intracellular localization of cisplatin in esophageal cancer cell lines and determined their sensitivity to cisplatin using in-air micro-PIXE (particle induced X-ray emission). Two human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines, TE-2 and TE-13, were examined for their response to cisplatin using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and DNA fragmentation assays. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was also used to evaluate the mRNA expression of multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) in both cell lines. Platinum localizations of intracellular and intranuclear were measured using in-air micro-PIXE. TE-2 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin than TE-13 cells (IC(50): 37.5 mu m and 56.3 mu m, respectively). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that more TE-2 than TE-13 cells were in the sub-G1 phase. DNA fragmentation assay was analyzed to confirm the MTT assay and flow cytometry results. The expression of MRP2 mRNA in TE-13 cells was stronger than in TE-2 cells. In-air micro-PIXE showed that TE-2 cells had higher intracellular cisplatin concentrations than TE-13 cells and the ratio of intranuclear to intracellular cisplatin in individual cells was not significantly different. We observed the intracellular and intranuclear localization of cisplatin using in-air micro-PIXE. The results of this study suggest that in-air micro-PIXE could be a useful quantitative method for evaluating the cisplatin sensitivity of individual cells. Finally, we speculate that MRP2 in the cell membrane may play an important role in regulating the cisplatin sensitivity of ESCC cells. (Cancer Sci 2010)."

Very scanty information is available on the isolation of S. pseudopneumoniae from India. Hence, the present study was an attempt to isolate S. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to study their drug resistance pattern. Methods: Sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. Alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and opto chin susceptibility in 5 per cent CO2 and ambient air. Disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic sus ceptibilily testing. Results: Among the samples screened, 4 per cent showed the growth of only S. pseudopneumoniae. Other pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans. All the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Interpretation \& conclusions: Our preliminary results showed presence of S. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with RTI. Currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent CO2 as S. pneumoniae and the resistant ones are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. As a result, S. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. Hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent CO2 and ambient air along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. pseudopneumoniae."

Eleven plant natural products have been approved for therapeutic use during the same period none of them being antimicrobial agents. We have learned through experience that some microorganisms will inevitably overcome antibiotic treatment in certain situations, and then spread. It is clear that the rate of new antimicrobial development is insufficient to meet our current and future needs, which should be addressed in order to guarantee the effective future of antimicrobial chemotherapy. However, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of peer-reviewed reports of antimicrobial efficacy among plant-derived secondary metabolites. A limitation with these reports is the wide range of modified in vitro methods used to determine antimicrobial efficacy of these products, showing an absence of the type of standardisation that is the norm when testing the efficacy of single- or combined-agent conventional antimicrobials in the laboratory, thereby making inter-study comparison difficult. Overall, despite the large diversity in preparation and testing strategies used currently for natural product plant-derived antimicrobials, our investigations suggest that the field shows promise in the provision of novel antimicrobial agents, even as exemplified by our selected example, mule helenium (Elecampane)."

As a consequence of intensification, the accumulation of more than 220 kg/ha of nitrates, 2500 ppm of phosphorus and 261 kg/ha Zn in soil has been detected. In groundwater, excess of nitrates (180 ppm) and microbiological contamination are frequent, and it has been recently encountered phosphorus up to 7 ppm and copper up to 90 ppb.

Forty A. terreus strains originating from environmental sources (air and soil) were identified using by macroscopic and microscopic features. Six antifungals including, amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and luliconazole were applied for susceptibility tests.

Use of antibiotics in this manner has become the source of increasing controversy because overuse of antibiotics is suspected of leading to resistance in bacteria that cause human diseases. The purpose of this study was to measure airborne antibiotic concentrations in a swine production facility that routinely included antibiotics in feed. Samples were collected in a hog facility that included rooms devoted to farrowing, nursery, and growing operations. Analytical methods were developed to measure concentrations of the antibiotics tylosin and lincomycin in air samples. Tylosin was mixed in the feed in some of the rooms in the facility. While lincomycin was not added during this study, it had been used in this facility in the past and therefore was included in the analytical testing. Inhalable (n = 34), respirable (n = 37), and high-volume (n = 16) dust samples were collected on PVC filters over a two-month period. Tylosin concentrations were above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in 93% of the samples, while lincomycin concentrations were above the LOQ in only 9% of the samples (LOQ = 0.04 ng/sample). The average tylosin concentrations were 3, 18, and 49 ng/m3 in the respirable, inhalable, and high-volume samples, respectively. No occupational or environmental worker exposure criteria currently exist for antibiotics in air. The results of this study may be used to estimate potential swine production worker exposures and to further study the association between these exposures and health effects."

Understanding how infections spread is pivotal to public health yet current knowledge of indoor transmission remains poor. AIM: To review the roles of natural ventilation and sunlight for controlling infection within healthcare environments. METHODS: Comprehensive literature search was performed, using electronic and library databases to retrieve English language papers combining infection; risk; pathogen; and mention of ventilation; fresh air; and sunlight. Foreign language articles with English translation were included, with no limit imposed on publication date. FINDINGS: In the past, hospitals were designed with south-facing glazing, cross-ventilation and high ceilings because fresh air and sunlight were thought to reduce infection risk. Historical and recent studies suggest that natural ventilation offers protection from transmission of airborne pathogens. Particle size, dispersal characteristics and transmission risk require more work to justify infection control practices concerning airborne pathogens. Sunlight boosts resistance to infection, with older studies suggesting potential roles for surface decontamination. CONCLUSIONS: Current knowledge of indoor transmission of pathogens is inadequate, partly due to lack of agreed definitions for particle types and mechanisms of spread. There is recent evidence to support historical data on the effects of natural ventilation but virtually none for sunlight. Modern practice of designing healthcare buildings for comfort favours pathogen persistence. As the number of effective antimicrobial agents declines, further work is required to clarify absolute risks from airborne pathogens along with any potential benefits from additional fresh air and sunlight."

Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen with the capacity to cause severe debilitating infection, constitutes a significant proportion of these isolates. Experiments conducted during short-term night suggest that growth in microgravity leads to increases in bacterial antibiotic resistance and to cell wall changes. Growth under low-shear modelled microgravity (LSMMG) indicated that a reduced gravitational field acts as an environmental signal for expression of enhanced bacterial virulence in gram-negative pathogens. We therefore examined the effect of simulated microgravity on parameters of antibiotic susceptibility and virulence in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates RF1, RF6 and RF11: these strains were grown in a high aspect ratio vessel under LSMMG and compared with cells grown under normal gravity (NG). There were no significant differences in antibiotic susceptibility of staphylococci grown under LSMMG compared to NG. LSMMG-induced reductions in synthesis of the pigment staphyloxanthin and the major virulence determinant alpha-toxin were noted. Significant changes in global gene expression were identified by DNA microarray analysis; with isolate RF6, the expression of hla and genes of the regulatory system saeR/saeS were reduced approximately two-fold. These data provide strong evidence that growth of S. aureus under modelled microgravity leads to a reduction in expression of virulence determinants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus underlines the need for a vaccine. Defining immune correlates of protection may support the design of an effective vaccine. We used a murine Staphylococcus aureus infection model, in which bacteria were inoculated in an air pouch generated on the back of the animal. Analysis of the air-pouch content in mice immunized or not with an adjuvanted multiantigen vaccine formulation, four-component S. aureus vaccine (4C-Staph), prior to infection allowed us to measure bacteria, cytokines, and 4C-Staph-specific antibodies and to analyze host immune cells recruited to the infection site. Immunization with 4C-Staph resulted in accumulation of antigen-specific antibodies in the pouch and mitigated the infection. Neutrophils were the most abundant cells in the pouch, and they showed the upregulation of Fc gamma receptor ( Fc gamma R) following immunization with 4C-Staph. Reduction of the infection was also obtained in mice immunized with 4C-Staph and depleted of neutrophils; these mice showed an increase in monocytes and macrophages.

In this study, we report a case with a simultaneous development of OP and RA. The patient presented with concurrent flu-like symptoms and arthralgia of multiple joints, and antibiotic therapy was not effective. The rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated antibodies were both high. Multiple air-space opacities on chest radiographs and bilateral peripheral consolidations on high-resolution computed tomography films were evident. The histology of transbronchial lung biopsy samples was characterized by intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue consisting of intermixed myofibroblasts and connective tissues. Treatment with prednisolone induced a complete recovery from OP without relapses. Our review of previous reports about RA-associated OP (RA-OP) suggested that the high titer of RF and increased disease activity of RA indicate a great risk of developing OP. This condition may represent a lung's reaction in the RA-associated inflammatory and/or immune process. We should be aware of RA-OP cases in which pulmonary manifestations precede articular symptoms. In these cases, respiratory manifestations are the main evidence of RA activity. In most cases of steroid-resistant RA-OP, the use of immunosuppressants was effective. Since OP may progress to fibrotic lung disease during the course of RA, we may consider performing a second lung biopsy for steroid-resistant patients, even if they have once been diagnosed as OP."

This problem applies mainly to public areas where we spend a large part of our lives. This study was focused on the microbiological analysis of the air in some kindergartens and antibiotic resistance of bacteria of the Stephylococcus spp. genus. The identification of the isolated mould fungi has been also made. Material and Methods: Air samples were collected from classrooms in the seasonal cycle in the mornings and afternoons using 2 methods, sedimentation and impact. Air samples collected outside the kindergartens served as controls. Air quality assessments were based on the groups of indicator microorganisms, according to Polish standards. The susceptibility of isolated staphylococci was assessed with the disc-diffusion method, using 8 different classes of antibiotics, in line with the recommendations of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Results: The analyses show that, regardless of the method, the total number of heterothropic bacteria and staphylococci in the air of the analyzed kindergartens exceeded the allowable limits. There was no air pollution with the fungal infection. Based on the antibiogram, it was found that Staphylococcus spp. strains showed the highest sensitivity to chloramphenicol and the lowest to penicillin and gentamicin. Among the fungi moulds of the genus Cladosporium predominated. Conclusions: The results of the analyses highlight the need for regular health checks and further research to help identify biological factors that may significantly affect the quality of health of people living in public spaces.

Previous ribavirin aerosol treatments of influenza were effective and drug resistance was not observed. To make ribavirin aerosol treatment a quicker process and limited to once or twice daily treatments, a MegaRibavirin formulation (100 mg of ribavirin/mL) was developed that when used with the Aerotech II nebulizer was effective in preventing death in a lethal influenza A virus mouse model. Aerosol generated using the Aerotech II nebulizer flowing at 10 L of air/min produced aerosol droplets that contained 2.3 mg of ribavirin/L with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1.8 mu m. Using this system for treatment, a single daily 30-min exposure on days 1-4 produced a survival rate of greater than 90\%. Delaying the start of aerosol treatment for 48 or 72 h and treating once daily for 30 min for two days (days 2-3 and 3-4, respectively) still significantly increased the number of survivors and mean time to death. For the treatment of influenza in general and for pandemic avian influenza, the MegaRibavirin-Aerotech II method of aerosol treatment allows for short treatment periods, minimizes environmental issues and costs less.

Such speculation, based on the isolation of resistant mutants from in vitro monoculture experiments, is not reflected by air emergence of biocide-resistant strains in vivo. This review provides a broad coverage of the biocide and resistance literature and evaluates the potential risks, perceived from such laboratory monoculture experiments, against evidence gathered over 50 years of field studies. An explanation for the continued effectiveness of broad-spectrum biocidal agents against the decline in efficacy of therapeutic agents is provided based on the fitness costs of resistance and the ubiquity of naturally occurring substances that possess antibacterial effect. While we conclude from this review of the literature that the incorporation of antibacterial agents into a widening sphere of personal products has had little or no impact on the patterns of microbial susceptibility observed in the environment, the associated risks remain finite. The use of such products should therefore be associated with a clear demonstration of added value either to consumer health or to the product life. Hygienic products should therefore be targeted to applications for which the risks have been established."

Although several new TB diagnostics have been developed, including rapid molecular tests, there is a need for simpler point-of-care tests. Treatment usually requires a prolonged course of multiple antimicrobials, stimulating efforts to develop shorter drug regimens. Although the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is used worldwide, mainly to prevent life-threatening TB in infants and young children, it has been ineffective in controlling the global TB epidemic.

Although the rates of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant Haemophilus influenzae have risen to alarming levels, the rates of respiratory FQ (RFQ) resistance amongst these isolates remain relatively low. It is reported that ca. 1-7\% of CAP cases are re-diagnosed as pulmonary TB in Asian countries. A longer duration (>= 7 days) of symptoms, a history of night sweats, lack of fever (>38 degrees C), infection involving the upper lobe, presence of cavitary infiltrates, opacity in the lower lung without the presence of air, low total white blood cell count and the presence of lymphopenia are predictive of pulmonary TB. Amongst patients with CAP who reside in TB-endemic countries who are suspected of having TB, imaging studies as well as aggressive microbiological investigations need to be performed early on. Previous exposure to a FQ for > 10 days in patients with TB is associated with the emergence of FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. However, rates of M. tuberculosis isolates with FQ resistance are significantly higher amongst multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates than amongst susceptible isolates. Consequently, in Taiwan and also in other countries with TB endemicity, a short-course (5-day) regimen of a RFQ is still recommended for empirical therapy for CAP patients if the patient is at low risk for TB.

Methods: This mixed methods study (triangulation design) was carried out across all the six DR-TB centers of Karnataka state, India, between November 2016 and April 2017. Non-participant observation using a structured format was carried out at the DR-TB wards (n = 6), outpatient departments (n = 6), patient waiting areas outside outpatient departments (n = 6) and culture and drug susceptibility testing laboratories (n = 3). Structured interviews of admitted patients (n = 30) were done to assess the knowledge on cough hygiene and sputum disposal. Key informant interviews (KIIs) of health care providers (n = 20) were done. Manual descriptive content analysis was done to analyse the transcripts of KIIs. Results: The findings related to compliance in non-participant observation were corroborated by KIIs. All the laboratories were consistently implementing the AIC guidelines. Compliance to hand hygiene, wet mopping and ventilation measures were satisfactory in four or more DR-TB wards. The non-availability of N95 masks in wards as well as outpatient departments was staggering. Sputum disposal without prior disinfection and the lack of display materials on cough hygiene and patient education was common. Patient fast tracking in outpatient department waiting areas and visitor restrictions in wards were lacking. Trainings on AIC measures were uncommon. About half and one-third of patients admitted had satisfactory knowledge regarding sputum disposal and situations demanding mask respectively. The reasons for unsatisfactory compliance to AIC guidelines were poor coordination between programme and hospital authorities leading to lack of ownership; ineffective or non-existent infection control committees; vacant posts of medical officers; and attitudes of health care delivery staff. Conclusion: Compliance with AIC guidelines in DR-TB centers of Karnataka was sub-optimal. The reasons identified require urgent attention of the programme managers and hospital authorities."

We prospectively analyzed 70 ETT samples obtained from pigs randomized to be untreated (controls, n = 20), or treated with vancomycin (n = 32) or linezolid (n = 18). A clinical MRSA strain (MRSA-in) was inoculated in pigs to create a pneumonia model, before treating with antibiotics. Tracheally intubated pigs with MRSA severe pneumonia, were mechanically ventilated for 69 +/- 16 hours. All MRSA isolates retrieved from ETTs (ETT-MRSA) were tested for their in vitro biofilm production by microtiter plate assay. In vitro biofilm production of MRSA isolates was sequentially studied over the next 8 days post-extubation to assess biofilm capability dynamics over time. All experiments were performed under ambient air (O2) or ambient air supplemented with 5% CO2. We collected 52 ETT-MRSA isolates (placebo N = 19, linezolid N = 11, and vancomycin N = 22) that were clonally identical to the MRSA-in. Among the ETT-MRSA isolates, biofilm production more than doubled after extubation in 40% and 50% under 5% CO2 and O2, respectively. Systemic antibiotic treatment during intubation did not affect this outcome. Under both atmospheric conditions, biofilm production for MRSA-in was at least doubled for 9 ETT-MRSA isolates, and assessment of these showed that biofilm production decreased progressively over a 4-day period after extubation. In conclusion, a weak biofilm producer MRSA strain significantly enhances its biofilm production within an ETT, but it is influenced by the ETT environment rather than by the systemic treatment used during intubation or by the atmospheric conditions used for bacterial growth."

A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was employed to analyze bacteria-phage interactions. The lyric phages were transformed into phage spheroids by exposure to water-chloroform interface. Phage spheroid monolayers were transferred onto QCM-D sensors by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Biosensors were tested in the flow mode with bacterial water suspensions, while collecting frequency and energy dissipation changes. Bacteria-spheroid interactions resulted in decreased resonance frequency and an increase in dissipation energy for both MRSA and MSSA strains. Following the bacterial binding, these sensors were further exposed to a flow of the penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2a) specific antibody conjugated latex beads. Sensors tested with MRSA responded to PBP 2a antibody beads: while sensors examined with MSSA gave no response. This experimental difference establishes an unambiguous discrimination between methicillin resistant and sensitive S. aureus strains. Both free and immobilized bacteriophages strongly inhibit bacterial growth on solid/air interfaces and in water suspensions. After lytic phages are transformed into spheroids, they retain their strong lytic activity and demonstrate high bacterial capture efficiency. The phage and phage spheroids can be used for screening and disinfection of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Other applications may include use on biosensors, bacteriophage therapy, and antimicrobial surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the capacity of 40 E. coli O26 isolates of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC, n = 27), potential EHEC (pEHEC, n = 3), atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC, n = 8) and non-toxigenic E. coli (NTEC, n = 2) from human and cattle sources to form biofilms on different surfaces, and determine whether extracellular matrix (ECM) components (cellulose, curli), motility, prophage insertion in mlrA and cell surface hydrophobicity could influence biofilm formation. Finally, the influence of biofilm formation on the sensitivity of isolates to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs; Profoam, Kwiksan 22) and peracetic acid-based sanitizer (Topactive Des.) for 2 min on polystyrene plate were also evaluated. Results: Biofilm production on one surface may not indicate biofilm formation on a different surface. Biofilm was formed by different pathotypes on polystyrene (70\%), stainless steel (87.5\%) and glass slides (95\%), however only 50\% demonstrated pellicle formation. EHEC isolates were significantly more likely to form a pellicle at the air-liquid interface and biofilms on polystyrene surface at 48 h than aEPEC. Strains that don't produce ECM (curli or cellulose), harbor a prophage insertion in mlrA and are non-motile have lower biofilm forming capacities than those isolates possessing combinations of these attributes. Hydrophobicity had no impact on biofilm formation. After 2 min exposure, none of the disinfectants tested were able to completely inactivate all cells within a biofilm regardless of pathotypes and the amount of biofilm formed. Conclusion: Pathotypes of E. coli O26 showed varying capacities to form biofilms, however, most EHEC strains had the capacity to form biofilm on all surfaces and at the air-liquid interface under the conditions used in this study. Biofilms provided a protective effect to E. coli O26 strains against the three sanitizers, previously shown to successfully control the growth of their planktonic counterparts.

They describe the application of acoustic levitation to support protein crystals for X-ray diffraction experiments carried out at Synchrotron light sources. For clarity, a typical acoustic levitation system generates intense acoustic waves which are reflected back from a mirroring surface set at a distance matched to the frequency of sound being used. In air the reflected acoustic waves generate locations of minimum pressure or 'nodes' which act as wells for micron sized particles in the solution such as crystals. Multiple nodes can be generated and the nodes can also be made to process. This system can localise crystals periodically in air and therefore have enormous potential as a crystal sample delivery system. The system described in this work is a varient from this, described by Marzo et al [2]and uses multiple transducers and there is no requirement for a mrror surface as the sound from multiple tranducers generates the accoustic trap. These acoustic traps also have the significant benefit of eliminating potential beam attenuation due to support structures or microfluidic devices. There is an additional need to eliminate sample environments when similar experiments are carried out using an X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) such as the LCLS at Stanford California as any sample environment would not survive the exposure to the X Ray beam. At an XFEL the Xrays are a billion times brighter than synchrotron radiation sources. The application for this system will be to exmine turn over in Beta lactomase proteins. The system will allow for diffraction data to be collected before and after turnover.

In this particular period in which we find ourselves, characterized by globalization, the international community has become aware that the re-emergence of these diseases poses an important risk for public health underlines the necessity to adopt appropriate strategies for their prevention and control. The re-emerging diseases of the twenty-first century are a serious problem for public health and even though there has been enormous progress in medical science and in the battle against infectious diseases, they are still a long way from being really brought under control. A well organized monitoring system would enable the epidemiological characteristics of the infectious diseases to be analyzed and the success or otherwise of preventive interventions to be precisely evaluated. For this reason, the World Health Organization and the European Union have discussed the formation of a collaborative network for the monitoring and control of re-emerging diseases and has initiated special programmes. The battle between humanity and infectious disease has a history lasting thousands of years and is destined to continue in the future emphasizing the need to adopt combined policies for the prevention and control of re-emerging diseases."

Our aim was to explore the value and limits of surgery in patients with advanced TB. A retrospective study of 57 consecutive patients who underwent thoracic surgery for culture-positive bilateral cavitary pulmonary TB was performed. Forty-four (77.2\%) patients were men and 13 (22.8\%) patients were women; their ages were in the range of 18-61 years. Twenty-two (38.6\%) patients had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and 35 (61.4\%) patients had extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB confirmed with cultures. On admission, 49 (86.0\%) patients had sputum smear microscopy positive for acid-fast bacilli. The main indication for surgery was treatment failure manifested as contagious persisting cavities despite best available therapy. The surgical procedures included combinations of pulmonary resections of different levels, selective thoracoplasties and/or endobronchial valve treatment. The operations were performed consecutively, starting with the most affected side. TB therapy preceded the operation for a minimum of 6 months and was continued after the operation on the basis of the patient's susceptibility to drugs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We performed 121 operations: 42 in 22 patients with MDR TB (1.9 operations per patient) and 79 procedures in 35 patients with XDR TB (2.3 operations per patient). No deaths occurred in the 1st year. Two late deaths followed, 1 unrelated to and 1 due to TB progression. Ten major complications (1 complication per patient) developed: main bronchus stump fistula (n = 4), prolonged air leak (n = 3), respiratory failure (n = 2) and wound seroma (n = 1). At the 1-month follow-up visit, sputum smear conversion was observed in 11 (68.8\%) patients with MDR and in 15 (45.5\%) patients with XDR TB. At the late (20-36 months) follow-up visit, culture negativity was achieved in 21 (95.5\%) patients with MDR TB and in 23 (65.7\%) patients with XDR TB (P = 0.015). Thoracic surgery may significantly improve patients' outcomes and even result in a cure in a good portion of patients with bilateral cavitary MDR and XDR TB and should be considered as the essential element of multimodality treatment for MDR and XDR TB, even in patients with bilateral cavitary disease and borderline respiratory reserves."

To elucidate the biochemical basis of MMC resistance, we isolated a drug resistant derivative (designated CHO-MMC) of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) by exposure to progressively higher concentrations of MMC. CHO-MMC cells exhibited a 17-fold increase in resistance to MMC and were 33-fold cross-resistant to the monofunctional derivative, decarbamoyl mitomycin C. In contrast, CHO-MMC cells showed only a 2-fold level of resistance to BMY 25282, a more easily activated analogue of MMC, and exhibited parental sensitivity to MMC under radiobiologically hypoxic conditions. CHO-MMC cells showed no increased resistance to a range of DNA damaging agents including several other alkylating agents (e.g., melphalan and methyl methanesulfonate). Cross-resistance to drugs associated with the multidrug resistant phenotype (e.g.t Adriamycin and vincristine) was present only at very low levels. Using a specific high performance liquid chromatography technique, we examined the rates of reduction of MMC and BMY 25282 in cell extracts from CHO-K1 and CHO-MMC cells under both aerobic (air) and hypoxic (N2) conditions. Reduction rates for both drugs were at least 30-fold faster under nitrogen than in air. Metabolism of MMC was undetectable in air but was readily detectable under nitrogen and was 2-3-fold slower in CHO-MMC cell extracts than in CHO-K1 cell extracts. Although BMY 25282 was more readily reduced under nitrogen, no difference was detected between extracts from CHO-K1 or CHO-MMC cells in the rate of reduction of BMY 25282 under either air or nitrogen. The activity of NADPHicytochrome P-450 (cytochrome c) reductase, an enzyme implicated in the bioreductive activation of MMC, was 3-4-fold lower in CHO-MMC cells than in the parental line. These findings suggest that the resistance of CHO-MMC cells to MMC under aerobic conditions may be due to impaired metabolic activation of the drug as a result of a decrease in NADPH.cytochrome P-450 reductase activity. This supports the view that decreased bioreductive enzyme activity may be a significant mechanism for acquired resistance to MMC in tumor cells in vivo and that more readily activated analogues may be potentially useful in overcoming this specific form of resistance.  1990, American Association for Cancer Research.

A possible mechanism contributing to survival of Acinetobacter baumannii is its ability to form a biofilm-like structure at the air/liquid interface, known as a pellicle. This study aimed to identify and characterise the molecular mechanisms required for pellicle formation in Acinetobacter baumannii and to assess a broad range of clinical Acinetobacter baumannii strains for their ability to form these multicellular structures. Results: Random transposon mutagenesis was undertaken on a previously identified hyper-motile variant of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 designated 17978hm. In total three genes critical for pellicle formation were identified; cpdA, a phosphodiesterase required for degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and A1S\_0112 and A1S\_0115 which are involved in the production of a secondary metabolite. While motility of the A1S\_0112::Tn and A1S\_0115::Tn mutant strains was abolished, the cpdA::Tn mutant strain displayed a minor alteration in its motility pattern. Determination of cAMP levels in the cpdA::Tn strain revealed a similar to 24-fold increase in cellular cAMP, confirming the role CpdA plays in catabolising this secondary messenger molecule. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis of the cpdA::Tn strain showed significant down-regulation of the operon harboring the A1S\_0112 and A1S\_0115 genes, revealing a link between these three genes and pellicle formation. Examination of our collection of 54 clinical Acinetobacter baumannii strains revealed that eight formed a measurable pellicle; all of these strains were motile. Conclusions: This study shows that pellicle formation is a rare trait in Acinetobacter baumannii and that a limited number of genes are essential for the expression of this phenotype. Additionally, an association between pellicle formation and motility was identified. The level of the signalling molecule cAMP was found to be controlled, in part, by the cpdA gene product, in addition to playing a critical role in pellicle formation, cellular hydrophobicity and motility. Furthermore, cAMP was identified as a novel regulator of the operon A1S\_0112-0118."

Eight of 35 Mantoux-negative students who attended the autopsy of an immunosuppressed patient with unsuspected active tuberculosis became infected and one developed clinical disease. A report of the incident was prepared for publication because it supported the then controversial University policy of recommending BCG vaccination to medical and dental students in a country where the reported prevalence of tuberculosis is very low. The report was never published, mainly in order to protect the privacy of the individual students involved, but also because it was felt by the administration of the time that it might undermine confidence in infection control procedures in the autopsy room. The original report, updated and reproduced here, suggested that tuberculosis might be an emerging nosocomial problem. This has been all too clearly realised since its re-emergence as an opportunistic infection in AIDS patients. Worldwide, the problem of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis(1,2) provides an added risk of a return to the situation which prevailed early this century when tuberculosis was a major occupational risk for young health care workers. Infection often restricted career choices, even in those whose disease was relatively benign. Our purpose in bringing this incident to light after so many years is to point out the relevance of the extensive studies of the problem which were conducted in the 1930s and 1940s to the current situation and to suggest that health care students are vulnerable to airborne infections as well as those spread by inoculation injuries. In retrospect, our 1979 conclusions about prospects for preventing nosocomial tuberculosis appear optimistic."

Samples obtained from delicatessens showed a much higher L monocytogenes contamination rate (83\%) than those from open-air markets (6.7\%) or supermarkets (0\%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis indicated that the 21 bacterial isolates belonged to 12 ST subgroups. ST5 was the largest and contained 7 isolates (333\%); it was followed by ST474, ST121 and ST9 (each containing 2 isolates {[}10.5\%]). Antibiotic susceptibility analysis showed that the 21 L monocytogenes isolates were thoroughly resistant to cefoxitin but highly susceptible to doxycycline and ciprofloxacin. The presence of 10 virulence genes was evaluated by PCR, which showed that inlA, iniC, iniJ, prfA, hlyA, and plcH were present in all isolates and that iniB, actA, plcA and iap were present in 71.4-90.5\% of the isolates.

The in-vitro activities of the two components separately and together in different ratios were determined for a collection of 100 Haemophilus influenzae strains representing various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The NCCLS microdilution susceptibility testing procedure incorporating Haemophilus test medium (HTM) broth was used to determine MICs of quinupristin, dalfopristin and seven other antimicrobial agents. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 4 and 8, 4 and 16, and 64 and 128 mg/L for quinupristin/dalfopristin (30:70), dalfopristin and quinupristin, respectively. MICs of quinupristin and dalfopristin were also determined in Mueller-Hinton lysed horse blood broth and by HTM agar dilution testing. Compared with HTM broth-derived results, the MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin and its components were the same or one dilution higher in lysed horse blood and HTM agar incubated in air, and were equivalent or one dilution lower in HTM agar incubated in a CO2 atmosphere. The MICs of quinupristin and dalfopristin separately or together were directly proportional to erythromycin MICs, but were otherwise unaffected by any of the resistance mechanisms represented in these strains. MICs of quinupristin and dalfopristin combined in ratios of 10:90, 70:30 and 90:10 did not differ significantly from those of the 30:70 ratio. Thus, unlike the synergic activity noted against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against H. influenzae appears to be due almost entirely to the dalfopristin component of the combination."

Our results demonstrate that DMABI can be encapsulated in thin films of a model biocompatible polymer {[}poly(lactide-co-glycolide), PLG] and be released in quantities that inhibit the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by up to 75-90\% on surfaces that otherwise support robust biofilm growth. This approach enables the release of this new anti-biofilm agent for over one month, and it can be used to inhibit biofilm growth on both film-coated surfaces and other adjacent surfaces (e.g., on other uncoated surfaces and at air/water interfaces). Our results demonstrate a non-bactericidal approach to the prevention of biofilm growth and provide proof of concept using a clinically relevant human pathogen. In contrast to coatings designed to kill bacteria on contact, this approach should also permit the design of strategically placed depots that disseminate DMABI more broadly and exert inhibitory effects over larger areas. In a broader context, the non-bactericidal nature of DMABI could also provide opportunities to address concerns related to evolved resistance that currently face approaches based on the release of traditional microbicidal agents (e.g., antibiotics). Finally, the results of initial in vitro mammalian cell culture studies indicate that DMABI is not toxic to cells at concentrations required for strong anti-biofilm activity, suggesting that this new agent is well suited for further investigation in biomedical and personal care contexts."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Airborne virus like particles have been isolated from Grana Padano and Gorgonzola PDO cheese production plants and ripening cellars. A shotgun metagenomics analysis of the isolated viromes highlighted a high complexity of the viral communities both in terms of viral taxonomy and phage-host associations. Bacterial reads in each of the viromes were confirmed to be abundant and their taxonomy appeared to be associated to the environmental parameters and the technological processes that characterize the sampling area. Antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in each virome thus confirming that phages could be involved in the mobilization of antimicrobial resistances among bacterial populations. Interestingly human viruses were also identified even if the contamination source was not revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The environmental conditions, which are imposed by the technology of the dairy process, seams to shape the viral populations as a consequence of the adaptation of microbial taxa to those environments. The identification of sequences belonging to Legionella pneumophila and to the human papillomavirus, raised some considerations about the safety of cheese ripening cellars. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In conclusion, the analysis of the dairy airborne viromes, has revealed a high complexity of the viral communities even if the environments where the samples were collected were confined environments.

Methods: Retrospective study of all Canadian soldiers who were injured in Afghanistan and who required mechanical ventilation from January 1 2006 to September 1 2006. Patients who developed A. baumannii ventilator associated pneumonia ( VAP) were identified. All A. baumannii isolates were retrieved for study patients and compared with A. baumannii isolates from environmental sources from the Kandahar military hospital using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE). Results: During the study period, six Canadian Forces ( CF) soldiers were injured in Afghanistan, required mechanical ventilation and were repatriated to Canadian hospitals. Four of these patients developed A. baumannii VAP. A. baumannii was also isolated from one environmental source in Kandahar - a ventilator air intake filter. Patient isolates were genetically indistinguishable from each other and from the isolates cultured from the ventilator filter. These isolates were resistant to numerous classes of antimicrobials including the carbapenems. C onclusion: These results suggest that the source of A. baumannii infection for these four patients was an environmental source in the military field hospital in Kandahar. A causal linkage, however, was not established with the ventilator. This study suggests that infection control efforts and further research should be focused on the military field hospital environment to prevent further multi-drug resistant A. baumannii infections in injured soldiers."

Recently we recreated this model in Lime, Peru, and in this paper we report the use of molecular fingerprinting to investigate patient infectiousness in the current era of HIV infection and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Methods and Findings All air from a mechanically ventilated negative-pressure HIV-TB ward was exhausted over guinea pigs housed in an airborne transmission study facility on the roof. Animals had monthly tuberculin skin tests, and positive reactors were removed for autopsy and organ culture for M. tuberculosis. Temporal exposure patterns, drug susceptibility testing, and DNA fingerprinting of patient and animal TB strains defined infectious TB patients. Relative patient infectiousness was calculated using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. Over 505 study days there were 118 ward admissions of 97 HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients. Of 292 exposed guinea pigs, 144 had evidence of TB disease; a further 30 were tuberculin skin test positive only. There was marked variability in patient infectiousness; only 85\% of 118 ward admissions by TB patients were shown by DNA fingerprinting to have caused 98\% of the 125 characterised cases of secondary animal TB. 90\% of TB transmission occurred from inadequately treated MDR TB patients. Three highly infectious MDR TB patients produced 226, 52, and 40 airborne infectious units (quanta) per hour. Conclusions A small number of inadequately treated MDR TB patients coinfected with HIV were responsible for almost all TB transmission, and some patients were highly infectious. This result highlights the importance of rapid TB durg-susceptibility testing to allow prompt initiation of effective treatment, and environmental control measures to reduce ongoing TB transmission in crowded health care settings. TB infection control must be prioritized in order to prevent health care facilities from disseminating the drug-resistant TB that they are attempting to treat."

Accordingly, it seems particularly interesting to trace the fate of these bacteria and their genes encoding antibiotic resistance in both untreated sewage from hospitals, and in sewage after different stages of purification, and finally to examine the degree of their emissions to environment. Although wastewater treatment processes reduce number of bacteria in sewage up to 99\%, in the presented study it was reported that more than 2.7 x 10(3) CFU/mL E. coli reached the receiving water and contributed to dissemination of resistant bacteria into the environment. We received 395 E. coli strains from sewage and environmental samples and we investigated their antibiotic susceptibility and the presence of bla gene encoding TEM, CTX, OXA and SHV. From among 167 and 147 E. coli strains isolated from hospital effluents and municipal sewage in Olsztyn, Poland, up to 37.1\% and 17.7\%, respectively, were ESBL-positive. From among 38 and 43 strains isolated from river water and the air up to 18.4\% and 27.9\%, respectively, were ESBL-producers. The bla(CTX-M) (bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-3), bla(CTX-M-5), bla(CTX-M-15)) genes were the predominant group of the plasmid-coded ESBLs. More than 38\% out of ESBL-producing isolates carried several bla genes. The multiple-antibiotic-resistant (MAR) indexes for ESBL-positive were higher than for ESBL-negative isolates and ranged from 0.45 to 0.63. The MAR indexes for E. coli from hospital effluents and air samples were greater than the indexes calculated for strains isolated from other samples. Presumably, the preliminary disinfection of hospital sewage before its inflow into the sewage system might minimize the spreading of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the environment.

It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally, astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized. Methods: This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species-and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared. Results: Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. Conclusion: Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments."

Six new copper and cobalt complexes of azole derivatives were synthesized and isolated as air-stable solids and characterized by melting point analyses, elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and infrared and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The analyses and spectral data showed that the complexes had 1:1 (M:L) stoichiometries and tetrahedral geometries, the latter being supported by DFT calculations. The antibacterial activities of the metal complexes by themselves and combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs; 2 mu g mL(-1)) were assessed in vitro by broth microdilution assays against eight bacterial strains of clinical relevance. The results showed that the complexes alone exhibited moderate antibacterial activities. However, when the metal complexes were combined with AgNPs, their antibacterial activities increased (up to 10-fold in the case of complex 5), while human cell viabilities were maintained. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) values were in the range of 25-500 mu g mL(-1). This study thus presents novel approaches for the design of materials for fighting bacterial resistance. The use of azole complexes combined with AgNPs provides a new alternative against bacterial infections, especially when current treatments are associated with the rapid development of antibiotic resistance."

Methanol emitted by a wounded plant increases the accumulation of methanol-inducible gene mRNA and enhances antibacterial resistance as well as cell-to-cell communication, which facilitates virus spreading in neighboring plants. We concluded that methanol is a signaling molecule involved in within-plant and plant-to-plant communication. Methanol is considered to be a poison in humans because of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-mediated conversion of methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, recent data showed that methanol is a natural compound in normal, healthy humans. These data call into question whether human methanol is a metabolic waste product or whether methanol has specific function in humans. Here, to reveal human methanol-responsive genes (MRGs), we used suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA libraries of HeLa cells lacking ADH and exposed to methanol. This design allowed us to exclude genes involved in formaldehyde and formic acid detoxification from our analysis. We identified MRGs and revealed a correlation between increases in methanol content in the plasma and changes in human leukocyte MRG mRNA levels after fresh salad consumption by volunteers. Subsequently, we showed that the methanol generated by the pectin/PME complex in the gastrointestinal tract of mice induces the up- and downregulation of brain MRG mRNA. We used an adapted Y-maze to measure the locomotor behavior of the mice while breathing wounded plant vapors in two-choice assays. We showed that mice prefer the odor of methanol to other plant volatiles and that methanol changed MRG mRNA accumulation in the mouse brain. We hypothesize that the methanol emitted by wounded plants may have a role in plant-animal signaling. The known positive effect of plant food intake on human health suggests a role for physiological methanol in human gene regulation."

We identified 34 mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance within 34 soil, manure and wastewater samples from feedlot, ranch and dairy operations.

We found that the ranch samples contained significantly fewer resistance mechanisms than dairy and feedlot samples, and that the resistome of dairy operations differed significantly from that of feedlots.

Its effects have been seen on malaria in rates of imported cases, local outbreaks in non-endemic areas and the global spread of drug resistance. With elimination and global eradication back on the agenda, changing levels and compositions of imported malaria in malaria-free countries, and the threat of artemisinin resistance spreading from Southeast Asia, there is a need to better understand how the modern flow of air passengers connects each Plasmodium falciparum-and Plasmodium vivax-endemic region to the rest of the world. Methods: Recently constructed global P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria risk maps, along with data on flight schedules and modelled passenger flows across the air network, were combined to describe and quantify global malaria connectivity through air travel. Network analysis approaches were then utilized to describe and quantify the patterns that exist in passenger flows weighted by malaria prevalence. Finally, the connectivity within and to the Southeast Asia region where the threat of imported artemisinin resistance arising is highest, was examined to highlight risk routes for its spread. Results: The analyses demonstrate the substantial connectivity that now exists between and from malaria-endemic regions through air travel. While the air network provides connections to previously isolated malarious regions, it is clear that great variations exist, with significant regional communities of airports connected by higher rates of flow standing out. The structures of these communities are often not geographically coherent, with historical, economic and cultural ties evident, and variations between P. falciparum and P. vivax clear. Moreover, results highlight how well connected the malaria-endemic areas of Africa are now to Southeast Asia, illustrating the many possible routes that artemisinin-resistant strains could take. Discussion: The continuing growth in air travel is playing an important role in the global epidemiology of malaria, with the endemic world becoming increasingly connected to both malaria-free areas and other endemic regions. The research presented here provides an initial effort to quantify and analyse the connectivity that exists across the malaria-endemic world through air travel, and provide a basic assessment of the risks it results in for movement of infections."

Both drugs are structurally related, differing in an extra CF(3) group in the triflupromazine molecular structure. Surface tension data showed that the presence of an extra CF(3) in the molecular structure of triflupromazine involves a higher hydrophobicity of this drug and a restriction in the number of conformations molecules can adopt due to the presence of this bulkier atomic group. This involves a larger surface area in order to accommodate triflupromazine molecules at the interface. From conductivity measurements at different temperatures, the thermodynamic quantities of the micellization process of these drugs indicate that the aggregation is a spontaneous process, mainly enthalpic, where the London-dispersion forces play an active role. Using density and ultrasound velocity measurements, apparent molar volume and adiabatic compressibility of aqueous solutions of the amphiphilic cationic drugs have been determined. Positive deviations from the Debye-Huckel limiting law of the apparent molar volume were obtained from both drugs over the whole temperature range, which provides evidence of possible pre-association at concentrations below the critical concentration. Apparent molar adiabatic compressibility of the aggregates formed by these drugs was typical of those corresponding for an aggregate formed by a stacking process. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

WHO predicts that 30 million people will die of tuberculosis and 300 million will be infected by 2008. Tuberculosis is transmitted by air in coughing, sneezing, talking, or spitting. A tuberculosis infected person can easily infect an additional 10-20 people in the same year with the same strain. The re-emergence of tuberculosis infections is due to increased migration, international travel and tourism, AIDS, multi-drug resistance, and the weakening of public health care systems in both developed and developing countries. Multi-drug resistance occurs due to people's failure to take prescribed medications for the allotted time period. Treatment takes 6-8 months, but symptoms disappear after 2-3 months. People forget to take their drug regimens over such a long period. Some find costs too high for drugs or doctor visits. Tuberculosis bacilli can mutate and become resistant to new drugs if strains are not eradicated. WHO new management strategies offer a short course of treatment that must be followed up with support from medical staff. The Directly Observed Treatment Strategy (DOTS) eliminates the bacteria from the body and reduces the potential for contagion. DOTS has demonstrated high cure rates and low cost ($11-40/person)."

Seven episodes of potential transmission of TB infection during air travel reported in 1992-1994 caused widespread concern. Contact investigations revealed evidence of transmission of infection in two instances but active TB disease was not found in any of the infected individuals, or in subsequently published cases. In recent years, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has become an increasingly important public health problem in many countries, exacerbated by the emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). The potential risk of transmission of particularly dangerous forms of TB requires renewed vigilance. The revised International Health Regulations (1995) include new provisions which are relevant to the transmission of TB on aircraft.

Global threats from indoor and outdoor air pollution, urban crowding, biologic weapons, and worldwide rapid transportation complicate our efforts to reduce the impact of LRI disease in children. As new strategies are developed to limit the spread of LRI disease in children, existing pathogens become more complex to treat and newer pathogens emerge as causes of clinical disease. Most LRI disease is managed in outpatient settings and remains a challenge to those who care for children. RECENT FINDINGS: Atypical pathogens (notably mycoplasma pneumoniae) are now known to cause a wide spectrum of disease, and with more extensive complications than previously recognized. Available data suggest a rapid increase in S. pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and macrolides in many cases of community acquired pneumonia, which has resulted in shifts in outpatient (and inpatient) antibiotic treatment regimens. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is now recognized to cause LRI illness similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and children. General strategies for the prevention of influenza infection are expanded to include many infants and young children, and are projected to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from this key LRI pathogen. SUMMARY: The spectrum of LRI pathogens--and the clinical illnesses caused by them--continues to change. Innovations in immunotherapy and vaccines will be instrumental to reducing the burden of LRI morbidity in infants and children worldwide in the future."

To realize this objective, the bacilli suspension must be fresh and homogeneous, susceptible and resistant bacilli must be equally distributed, each bacillus must be dispersed as a single cell when the bacilli suspension is diluted, colony count must be reduced at a rate pararell to the dilution. The critical concentration of each drug should essentially be determined in a clinical manner, however as the multi-drug combination therapy in the rule for the treatment of tuberculosis, it is very difficult to make an exact determination of the resistance to each of drugs. It may be better, as Canetti pointed out, to decide using the pure bacteriological method and later compare findings with clinical studies, making changes in the future if so required. We choose to follow their criteria for nearly all of the drugs making only a few exceptions. 1) SM: DH-SM is not available in Japan as Japanese government prohibits its production. Growth on the medium containing SM (only concentration of less than 4 g/ml) was more abundant than on DH-SM media. Not knowing the fact that when an air-tight cap was used on the medium tube, the result of susceptible test shows 4-10 times higher resistance, we first used an air permeable cork cap. Futamura noticed the fact later and deviced the M-type cap, which is air-tight originaly, but allows air to flow into the tube automatically when needed. But such cap seemed not necessarily to be expected when employed routinely in the case of a SM con centration of 4 g/ml Next for the clinical study, considering the combined triple-drug treatment and relapse rate of positive bacilli after six months and one year, we adopted an 1% SM solution (10 g/ml) and the 0.2 g/ml of INH as the clinically significant criteria. 2) RFP: Among previously untreated patients, 1, 346 were tested using only the indirect method, revealing a critical concentration at 10 g/ml. Their critical proportions were 1-9% in 14 patients (1.0%) which might be technical mistakes, because retested 1/3 cases of them were found 0 % to 10 g/ml of RFP and the remainnig 2/3 also must be 0 %. For the detailed explanation, please see the literature (5). There were also 3 patients whoes critical proportion were 50 % or more. They are the true primary drug resistance cases and they are 0.1 % among total untreated 2, 450 patients. In the course of treatment including RFP, if resistant bacilli actually appeared in 1 % of the total bacillary population at 10 g/ml of RFP, its critical proportion always increased gradually and bacillary conversion was never attained. From these 2 reasons we adopted 1 % growth on 10 g/ml-RFP media as clinically significant criteria. The introduction of international standardization for resistance criteria is very problematic. Therefore in the meantime, it might be better to determine the most reliable, rapid and simple susceptibility test method, and present it for unanimous acceptance. There are many weak points for egg medium: 1) loss of drug potency while making the media, (depending on the drugs, for example, RFP and KM decrease to 1/10 but there is no change in INH): 2) difference between direct and indirect method, which also changes with the drugs and their concentrations, and 3) effect of the cap on SM resistance. Potency reduction is nearly non-existent during the production of agar media and none of the weak points, described above for egg media have been found.

We find that while XDR TB may present many challenges in the setting, of resource constraints, the central problems highlighted by the emergence of XDR TB are those that have plagued TB programmes for years. These Include a slow rate of case detection that permits prolonged infectiousness, the threat of airborne infection in enclosed spaces. the problem of inadequate treatment delivery and treatment completion, and the need to develop health systems that can address the combination of TB and poverty. Mathematical models of TB transmission shed light on the idea that community-based therapy and rapid detection systems may be beneficial in resource-limited settings, while congregate hospital wards are sites for major structural reform."

In western Kenya however some areas experience contrasting outcomes of the ongoing interventions while the causes for this observation remains not yet clearly known. Methods: The WHO insecticide (deltamethrin) susceptibility test of the common malaria vectors was studied. Multiple surveys on household use and hospital prescriptions of antimalarial drugs from 2003 to 2015 were done. Along with this, cross sectional surveys on their availability in the local drug dispensing outlets were also done in 2015. Monthly precipitations and air temperature data was collected along with systematic review on abundance and composition of common malaria vectors in the study area before and during interventions. The above factors were used to explain the possible causes of contrasting outcome of malaria interventions between the three study sites. Results: Areas with malaria resurgence or sustained high transmission (Kombewa and Marani) showed higher composition of Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) than the previously abundant Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and the later had higher composition to an area with a sustained infection decline (Iguhu). Anopheles gambiae s.l. from Kombewa showed highest resistance (50\% mortality) upon exposure to WHO deltamethrin discriminating dosage of 0.75\% while those from Marani and Iguhu had reduced resistance status (both had a mean mortality of 91\%). Sampled An. funestus s.l. from Marani were also highly resistant to deltamethrin as 57\% of the exposed vectors survived. An increasing of mean air temperature by 2 degrees C was noted for Marani and Iguhu from 2013 to 2015 and was accompanied by an increased rainfall at Marani. Community drug use and availability in selling outlets along with prescription in hospitals were not linked to the struggling control of the disease. Conclusions: The malaria vector species composition shift, insecticide resistance and climatic warming were the likely cause of the contrasting outcome of malaria intervention in western Kenya. Surveillance of malaria parasite and vector dynamics along with insecticide resistance and vector biting behaviour monitoring are highly recommended in these areas."

Inhalation of droplet nuclei, which are the airborne residual of droplets expelled from an infected host, is the primary means of transmission. Factors associated with transmission in shelters for the homeless include crowding, inadequate ventilation, and poor compliance with drug therapy. One of the greatest challenges to treatment of this infection among the homeless is the provision of adequate follow-up of patients who have begun therapy. Many individuals do not complete their treatment regimen. This creates an environment in which the transmission of tuberculosis, including multi-drug-resistant strains, can occur. Prevention strategies should focus on rapid identification and treatment of persons with active disease and latent tuberculosis infections.

After outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention proposed the use of respirators with high-efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA respirators) as part of isolation precautions against tuberculosis, along with a respiratory-protection program for health care workers that includes medical evaluation, training, and tests of the fit of the respirators. Each HEPA respirator costs between \$7.51 and \$9.08, about 10 times the cost of respirators currently used. Methods. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the University of Virginia Hospital on exposure to patients with tuberculosis and rates at which the purified-protein-derivative (PPD) skin test became positive in hospital workers. The costs of a respiratory-protection program were based on those of an existing program for workers dealing with hazardous substances. Results. During 1992, 11 patients with documented tuberculosis were admitted to our hospital. Eight of 3852 workers (0.2 percent) had PPD tests that became positive. Five of these conversions were believed to be due to the booster phenomenon; one followed unprotected exposure to a patient not yet in isolation; the other two occurred in workers who had never entered a tuberculosis isolation room. These data suggest that it will take more than one year for the use of HEPA respirators to prevent a single conversion of the PPD test. Assuming that one conversion is prevented per year, however, it would take 41 years at our hospital to prevent one case of occupationally acquired tuberculosis, at a cost of \$1.3 million to \$18.5 million. Conclusions. Given the effectiveness of currently recommended measures to prevent nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis, the addition of HEPA respirators would offer negligible protective efficacy at great cost."

Using primary human hepatocytes and transporter-overexpressing cells, DEPe was first shown to strongly inhibit activities of the sinusoidal solute carrier (SLC) uptake transporters organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1 and of the canalicular ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pump multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, with IC50 values ranging from approximately 1 to 20 mu g/mL and relevant to environmental exposure situations. By contrast, 25 mu g/mL DEPe failed to alter activities of the SLC transporter organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and of the ABC efflux pumps P-glycoprotein and bile salt export pump (BSEP), whereas it only moderately inhibited those of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide and of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Treatment by 25 mu g/mL DEPe was next demonstrated to induce expression of BCRP at both mRNA and protein level in cultured human hepatic cells, whereas it concomitantly repressed mRNA expression of various transporters, including OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1 and BSEP.

The EO were tested in vitro against a selection of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), Acinetobacter baumanii and Clostridium difficile. An EO blend containing lemongrass and geranium was used to formulate BioScent(TM) that was dispersed into the environment using the ST Pro(TM) machine. The effects were variable depending on the methods used. In a sealed box environment, MRSA growth on seeded plates was reduced by 38\% after 20 h exposure to BioScent(TM) vapour. In an office environment, the ST Pro(TM) machine dispersing BioScent(TM) effected an 89\% reduction of airborne bacteria in 15 h, when operated at a constant output of 100\%. EO vapours inhibited growth of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria in vitro and reduced surface and airborne levels of bacteria.

It is especially dangerous in southern Africa, where mining activity is a leading cause of HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. Inside mines, silica dust exposure causes long-term pulmonary damage. Living conditions are often substandard; poorly ventilated living quarters facilitate tuberculosis and airborne disease spread, and high rates of alcohol and tobacco use compromise immune responses. Family segregation, a legacy of apartheid's migrational labor system, increases the likelihood of risky sexual activity. Sex trafficking in women increases risks of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and labor trafficking in men through poorly regulated labor brokering impedes access to health care. Labor migration spreads mining hazards to rural, labor-supplying communities. Cross-border care is often inadequate or nonexistent, contributing to significantly greater rates of extensive and multi-drug resistance in miners, ex-miners, their families, and communities. Miners in high-income countries, working for the same trans-national companies, do not experience elevated rates of death and disability. Cost-effective interventions can reduce HIV incidence through social housing, curb trafficking of high-risk groups, stop tuberculosis spread through screening and detection, and reduce drug resistance by standardizing cross-border care. Urgent action is needed to respond to mining's staggering, yet avoidable disease toll in sub-Saharan Africa."

These studies are further complicated by the number of chemicals used in tobacco and individual smoking habits. An alternative approach is required to assess the biological responses. Objective Toxicogenomics was carried out to identify early molecular markers for events in pulmonary injury resulting from tobacco smoke components (TSC) exposure. Materials and methods EpiAirway-100 cells were exposed at the air/liquid interface to representative particle (nicotine; cadmium) and vapour phase {[}formaldehyde (FA) and ethyl carbamate] components of cigarette smoke. Microarray technology was used to compare expression profiles of human genes associated with toxicity and drug resistance, from control and TSC-treated respiratory epithelium (n = 5/dose). Results Using the GEArray `toxicology and drug resistance' microarray followed by significance analysis of microarray analysis, 42 mRNA transcripts were found to be significantly altered by the TSC exposure. The vapour {[}ethyl carbamate, FA and particle (nicotine, cadmium)] phase TSC exhibited differential transcriptional responses that could not be attributed to their chemical phase. The transcriptional changes could be classified according to a functional family, where ethyl carbamate, FA and cadmium classified as carcinogens, demonstrated the highest gene homology when compared with the noncarcinogen, nicotine. Discussion Analysis of the microarray data and further confirmation (reverse transcriptase-PCR) identified three potential biomarkers for TSC-induced injury. These three genes (CYP7A1, HMOX1 and PTGS1) are highly upregulated and have been linked with mechanistic pathways of disease."

TB is the second leading infectious cause of death after HIV/AIDS. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been undertaken to develop new anti-TB agents. The current frontline therapy for TB consists of administering three or more different drugs (usually isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) over an extended period of time. But these drugs will take 6-12 months to cure TB, along with many side effects; hence, there is an urgent need to explore new anti-TB agents. Quinoxaline derivatives are a class of compounds that show a spectrum of biological properties and the interest in these compounds is exponentially growing within the field of medicinal chemistry. Quinoxaline-1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives have shown to improve the biological results and are endowed with anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and anti-protozoal activities with application in many other therapeutic areas. Since quinoxaline derivatives are regarded as a new class of effective anti-TB candidates, their 1,4-di-N-oxide analogues may show promising in vitro and in vivo anti-TB activities and might be able to prevent the drug resistance to a certain extent. Therefore, the main aim of this review is to focus on important quinoxaline and quinoxaline-1,4-di-N-oxide analogues that have shown anti-TB activities, and their structure-activity relationships for designing anti-TB agents with better efficacies. The present review will be helpful in providing insights for rational designs of more active and less toxic quinoxaline-based anti-TB prodrugs."

Rhinoviruses belong to the family Picornaviridae and are divided into three species namely, Rhinovirus A, -B and -C, which are antigenically diverse. Genetic recombination is found to be one of the important causes for diversification of Rhinovirus species. Although emerging lineages within Rhinoviruses have been reported, their population structure has not been studied yet. The availability of complete genome sequences facilitates study of population structure, genetic diversity and underlying evolutionary forces, such as mutation, recombination and selection pressure. Analysis of complete genomes of Rhinoviruses using a model-based population genetics approach provided a strong evidence for existence of seven genetically distinct subpopulations. As a result of diversification, Rhinovirus A and -C populations are divided into four and two subpopulations, respectively. Genetically, the Rhinovirus B population was found to be homogeneous. Intra-species recombination was observed to be prominent in Rhinovirus A and -C species. Significant evidence of episodic positive selection was obtained for several sites within coding sequences of structural and nonstructural proteins. This corroborates well with known phenotypic properties such as antigenicity of structural proteins. Episodic positive selection appears to be responsible for emergence of new lineages especially in Rhinovirus A. In summary, the Rhinovirus population is an ensemble of seven distinct lineages. In case of Rhinovirus A, intra-species recombination and episodic positive selection contribute to its further diversification. In case of Rhinovirus C, intra- and inter-species recombinations are responsible for observed diversity. Population genetics approach was further useful to analyze phylogenetic tree topologies pertaining to recombinant strains, especially when trees are derived using complete genomes. Understanding of population structure serves as a foundation for designing new vaccines and drugs as well as to explain emergence of drug resistance amongst subpopulations."

The potential isolates were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of all, three isolates showed significant biofilm inhibition against V. cholerae. The results showed that 20\% of the actinomycetes culture supernatant could inhibit up to 80\% of the biofilm formation. When different extracted fractions were assessed, significant biofilm inhibition activity was only seen in the diethyl ether fraction of A745. At 200 mu g ml(-1) of diethyl ether fraction, 60\% inhibition of V. cholerae biofilm was observed. The two potential isolates were found to be Streptomyces sp. and one isolate belonged to Nocardiopsis sp. This is the first report showing a Streptomyces sp. and Nocardiopsis sp. isolated from the Arctic having a biofilm inhibitory activity against V. cholerae. The spread of drug resistant V. cholerae strains is a major clinical problem and the ineffectiveness in antibiotic treatment necessitates finding new modes of prevention and containment of the disease, cholera. The formation of biofilms during the proliferation of V. cholerae is linked to its pathogenesis. Hence, the bioactive compound from the culture supernatant of the isolates identified in this study may be a promising source for the development of a potential quorum sensing inhibitors against V. cholerae."

Such infections resolve in most people, and only a few infections lead to disease. However, many fungi are directly allergenic by colonising the respiratory tract or indirectly through contact with cell wall constituents and proteases, causing or exacerbating allergic disease. Increasing evidence implicates high indoor fungal exposures as a precipitant of asthma in children and in worsening asthma symptoms. Lung or airways infection by endemic fungi or aspergillus can be diagnosed with respiratory sample culture or serum IgG testing. Sputum, induced sputum, or bronchial specimens are all suitable specimens for detecting fungi; microscopy, fungal culture, galactomannan antigen, and aspergillus PCR are useful tests. Antifungal treatment is indicated in almost all patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary infections, chronic invasive and granulomatous rhinosinusitis, and aspergillus bronchitis. Most patients with fungal asthma benefit from antifungal therapy. Adverse reactions to oral azoles, drug interactions, and azole resistance in Aspergillus spp limit therapy.

One promising, but unexplored area in antimicrobial drug design is de novo purine biosynthesis. Recent research has shown that de novo purine biosynthesis in microbes is different from that in humans. The differences in the pathways are centered around the synthesis of 4-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR) which requires the enzyme N-5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (N-5-CAIR) synthetase. Humans do not require and have no homologs of this enzyme. Unfortunately, no studies aimed at identifying small-molecule inhibitors of N-5-CAIR synthetase have been published. To remedy this problem, we have conducted high-throughput screening (HTS) against Escherichia coli N-5-CAIR synthetase using a highly reproducible phosphate assay. HTS of 48,000 compounds identified 14 compounds that inhibited the enzyme. The hits identified could be classified into three classes based on chemical structure. Class I contains compounds with an indenedione core. Class II contains an indolinedione group, and Class III contains compounds that are structurally unrelated to other inhibitors in the group. We determined the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for five compounds representing each of the classes. Examination of compounds belonging to Class I indicates that these compounds do not follow normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Instead, these compounds inhibit N-5-CAIR synthetase by reacting with the substrate AIR. Kinetic analysis indicates that the Class II family of compounds are non-competitive with both AIR and ATP. One compound in Class III is competitive with AIR but uncompetitive with ATP, whereas the other is non-competitive with both substrates. Finally, these compounds display no inhibition of human AIR carboxylase: SAICAR synthetase indicating that these agents are selective inhibitors of N-5-CAIR synthetase. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of surveillance data from all cases of cholera reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1994, in the United States and its territories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory surveillance data. RESULTS: From 1992 through 1994, 160 cases of cholera were reported to CDC by 20 states and 1 territory. This is a marked increase: only 136 cases were reported from 1965 through 1991. Outbreaks affecting 75 passengers on an airplane from Latin America and 5 passengers on a cruise ship in Southeast Asia accounted for 50 percent of cases. Vibrio cholerae O139 caused 6 cases (4 percent). The proportion of V cholerae O1 isolates resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent rose from 3 percent in 1992 to 93 percent in 1994. Of 158 patients whose location of exposure was known, 151 (96 percent) acquired infection abroad (125 in Latin America, 26 in Asia). Of 105 persons whose reason for travel was known, 31 (30 percent) were US residents who had returned to their country of origin to visit family or friends, and 65 (62 percent) were non-US residents visiting the United States from cholera-affected countries. The cholera rate among persons arriving in the United States from cholera-affected regions was 0.27 case per 100000 air travelers, not substantially increased from earlier estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Cholera has increased in the United States since 1991, reflecting global changes in cholera epidemiology, and is now primarily travel associated and antimicrobial resistant. Most travelers were not traditional tourists; reaching them with prevention measures may be difficult. The risk of cholera to the individual traveler remains extremely low."

Molecular techniques, such as DNA amplification and sequence analysis of Pc genes, have played an important role in demonstrating a large degree of specificity and heterogeneity among the different Pc organisms and in studying Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) epidemiology. The genes analysis allowed to show that recurrence may be due to de novo infection rather than reactivation of organisms not eliminated by treatment during the first episode, the existence of coinfection with two different strains of Pc and to detect Pc DNA in ambient air. Studies of suspected person-to-person transmission, typing different DNA regions, most of the time rule out transmission within couple or hospitalized patients and therefore suggest that the most probable mode of transmission is environmental.

On the basis of site of tuberculosis it is mainly divided in to two categories: pulmonary and extra-pulmonary which is further divided into 5 and 7 different category, respectively. The TB is a highly contagious disease that is usually transmitted by coughing and sneezing. It is mainly diagnosed by detecting the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, abnormal chest x-ray and surgical biopsy in the patient. In 1998, World Health Organization has declared this disease a global emergency and established a new strategy for treating patients, called Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS). India is the highest TB burden country accounting for one fifth of the global incidence. There has been significant change in management of tuberculosis never since pre-chemotherapeutic era to the present day RNTCP protocol based on specific disease categories. Its initial management in an organized way was started in late 1930 when the main line of treatment was good food, open air and dry climate. Effective drugs against TB began available around the time India gained Independence and District Tuberculosis Programme (DTP) was started to reduce the TB problem across the country. But major problem raised was that of keeping the patients on continuous treatment as only 66\% of the patients were taking drugs regularly. In seventies, availability of two highly effective drugs-rifampicin and pyrazimamide enabled to cut down the duration of treatment and Short Course Chemotherapy (SCC) policy was implemented. Inspite of the introduction of SCC, a high rate of defaulters and the disturbing trends of low compliance in SCC districts were reported. In 1992, the Government of India designed the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme based on DOTS strategy. Phase 11 of the RNTCP started from October 2005, which is a step towards achieving the TB-related targets of the Millennium Development Goals. By March 2006, the programme was implemented nationwide in 633 districts, covering 1114 million (100\%) population. In 2008, 1.51 million patients have already been placed on treatment and NSP treatment success rate was 86\%."

A novel formulation of nanodisc (ND) containing super aggregated AMB (ND-AMB) for the treatment of fungal infections has been recently developed to provide greater protection from AMB toxicity than current, clinically approved lipid-based formulations. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the safety and potency of ND-AMB for sinonasal delivery using an in vitro model. Methods: Human sinonasal tissue was harvested during endoscopic sinus surgery and grown at air-liquid interface until well-differentiated. Cultures were exposed to ND-AMB vs AMB and changes in K(+) permeability and resistance were measured and recorded via Ussing chamber assay. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was analyzed in parallel as well as cytotoxic assay. Potency was assessed using real-time PCR measurement of the Aspergillus fumigatus 18S rRNA. Results: Ussing chamber studies revealed K(+) currents that increased rapidly within 30 s of adding AMB (10 mug/mL) to the apical side, indicating apical membranes had become permeable to K(+) ions. In contrast, negligible induction of K(+) current was obtained following addition of ND-AMB [AMB = (107.7 +/- 15.9) muA/cm(2) AMB vs ND-AMB = (2.3 +/- 0.7) muA/cm(2) ND-AMB; P = 0.005]. ND-AMB also protected nasal epithelial cells from cytotoxicity of AMB (P < 0.05). There was no difference in ciliary beat frequency between the two groups (P = 0.96). The expression of A. fumigatus 18S rRNA with exposure of lower dose of ND-AMB was significantly lower compared to that with AMB (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Data from the present study suggests ND-AMB protects human nasal epithelia membranes from AMB toxicity by protecting against apical cell K(+) permeability while maintaining uncompromised antifungal property compared to AMB. ND-AMB could provide a novel topical therapy for sinonasal fungal diseases."

DESIGN:Studies were conducted in either a nonventilated aerosol chamber or in a hospital isolation room that met CDC guidelines for TB control (negative pressure, greater than or equal to 6 air changes per hour, air exhausted directly to the outside). The rooms were challenged with aerosolized mineral oil in the size range of 0.3 to 5.0 mu m at levels 10 to 20 times the normal airborne particle load in the room at baseline. Airborne particles were counted with a laser counter capable of simultaneously measuring sizes greater than or equal to 0.3, greater than or equal to 0.5, greater than or equal to 1.0, and greater than or equal to 5.0 mu m. Experimental runs were conducted with the filtration units in the center or corner of the chamber or room, and the particle counter in the center of the room or at the exhaust vent. RESULTS: Portable filtration units were effective in accelerating the removal of aerosolized submicron particles. In the nonventilated room, time required by the various portable filtration units for removal of 90\% of aerosolized particles (greater than or equal to 0.3 mu m) ranged from a low of 5 to 6 minutes to a high of 18 to 31 minutes, compared to the control (no filtration unit), >171 minutes. In the hospital room, individual filtration units removed 90\% of aerosolized particles (greater than or equal to 0.3 mu m) in times ranging from 5 to 8 minutes to 9 to 12 minutes, compared to the control (no filtration unit), 12 to 16 minutes. The location of the portable filtration unit (center versus corner) did not affect the clearance rate of airborne particles. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that portable filtration units can rapidly reduce levels of airborne particles similar in size to infectious droplet nuclei and, therefore, may aid in reducing the risk of tuberculosis exposure (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 1995;16:391-398)."

Sri Lanka has currently achieved eradication of malaria but as it is a small island, developing country, it is vulnerable to climate change threats. Therefore the social influences, host immunity, anti-malarial resistance, prosperity and travel, were investigated with particular reference to potential climate change-induced malaria. Development of immunity depends on the intensity and stability of transmission within the region. Although Sri Lanka recently eradicated malaria, it was previously considered a region of low to moderate transmission, with most individual inoculation resulting in infection and disease at all ages. Self-medication when unrequired is particularly significant in contributing to the global issue of anti-malarial resistance. Despite known drug resistance, distribution continues to be widespread due to low over-the-counter cost and rapid relief of symptoms. Poverty promotes transmission of malaria and in turn malaria impedes economic growth. Malaria imposes economic loss beyond direct medical costs and associated effects to macroenomic costs by impacts on worker productivity, school children performance, etc. However improved economic growth is insufficient to eradicate malaria e.g. Oman. Air travel is a vital factor in malaria transmission due to conveyance of asymptomatic carriers from endemic to non-endemic countries, leading to outbreaks of epidemic malaria. Incidence of imported malaria has been observed mainly due to lapse or absence of prophylaxis. The management of malaria was examined under the categories of public healthcare services and mitigation measures. Mitigation measures were evaluated in relation to social factors, to determine their efficacy in the event of resurgent malaria. Mitigation techniques of prominence were anti-malarial therapy, Indoor Residual Spraying, Insecticide Treated Nets and Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets and lastly environmental management. Malaria is borne out of multiple risks; both environmental (i.e. climate change and environmental degradation) and social (i.e. anti-malarial resistance, migration and poverty). As observed in Sri Lanka, strong political commitment in prioritising malaria control with sustained resource allocation is vital to eliminate malaria. A multi-measure approach cross cutting public health care services and malaria interventions has proven effective despite some evident climate change impacts. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V."

Synergistic antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii was demonstrated for the combination formulation with high emitted doses (96\%) and fine particle fraction total (FPFtotal; 92\%). Storage of the spray-dried colistin alone formulation in the elevated relative humidity (RH) of 75\% resulted in a substantial deterioration in the aerosolization performance because the amorphous colistin powders absorbed significant amount of water up to 30\% by weight. In contrast, the FPFtotal values of the combination formulation stored at various RH were unchanged, which was similar to the aerosolization behavior of the spray-dried rifampicin-alone formulation. Advanced surface chemistry measurements by XPS and ToF-SIMS demonstrated a dominance of rifampicin on the combination particle surfaces, which contributed to the moisture protection at the elevated RH. This study shows a novel inhalable powder formulation of antibiotic combination with the combined beneficial properties of synergistic antibacterial activity, high aerosolization efficiency, and moisture protection."

Infection control practices for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) were assessed. Linear regression was used to examine associations between hospital characteristics and prevention bundle compliance and changes in MDRO infection rates. Results. A total of 212 of 245 (86.5\%) eligible hospitals responded. Most hospitals regularly used several fundamental infection control practices for MRSA and MDR-AB (ie, contact precautions, private room/cohorting, hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and antibiotic stewardship); advanced infection control practices (ie, active surveillance, chlorhexidine bathing, decolonization for MRSA, and hydrogen peroxide vaporizer for MDR-AB) were used less commonly. Facilities with >= 75\% compliance with the MRSA prevention bundle experienced a 17.4\% reduction in MRSA rates (P =.03). Although the presence of environmental cleaning services (41.3\% reduction, P =.01) and a microbiology laboratory (82.8\% reduction, P =.02) were among characteristics associated with decreases in MDR-AB rates, greater compliance with the MDR-AB prevention bundle did not lead to reductions in MDR-AB rates. Conclusions. Although fundamental MRSA and MDR-AB control practices are used regularly in most Thai hospitals, compliance with more comprehensive bundled prevention approaches is suboptimal. Improving compliance with bundled infection prevention approaches and promoting the integration of certain hospital factors into infection control efforts may help reduce MDRO infections in Thai hospitals."

Available tests to identify individuals with latent infection with M. tuberculosis are designed to identify immune response against mycobacterial antigens and have variable predictive value for the likelihood to develop active tuberculosis in different populations. Contact investigation should therefore be limited to situations with a clear likelihood of transmission or to those with a higher probability of developing active tuberculosis, for instance, young children and immunocompromised persons.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial spectrum against infectious bacteria and anti-inflammatory effect of ECCF in a mouse model of acute local inflammation. Materials and Methods: In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using standard plate assay technique. Antimicrobial activities (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC; mu g/mL) were determined with the serial dilution method. In vivo anti-inflammatory activity was studied using a mouse model of carrageenan-induced air pouch inflammation. Results: The ECCF showed antimicrobial activities against general bacteria and drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Mycrobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341, Mycrobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341, Salmonella typhimrium KCTC 1925, and nine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, with MIC values ranging from 250 to 1000 mu g/mL. In in vivo mouse model, inflammatory morphologic changes observed in the air pouch membrane were restored to its normal condition by the ECCF treatment. Moreover, the ECCF significantly reduced exudate volumes, protein contents, inflammatory cell counts, and proinflammatory cytokine levels in the exudates recovered from air pouches of the mouse model. Flavonoids in the ECCF were found to contain bergenin, quercitrin, and quercetin with reported anti-inflammatory activity via suppressing tumornecrosis factor-alpha production. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of ECCF.

The LPAI H9N2 viruses have the potential to evolve towards high levels of virulence in human. Some studies about the regional dispersal were reported, but global dissemination and the drivers of the virus are poorly understood, particularly at the genome scale. Here, we have analysed all eight gene segments of 168 H9N2 genomes sampled randomly aiming to provide a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and genetic variation of the viruses, and utilized phylogeography and spatial epidemiology approaches to uncover the effects of the genetic variation, predictors and spread of H9N2 viruses. We found that more frequent reassortment events involve segments PA, NP and NS, and 21 isolates have possible mosaic structure resulting from recombination events. Estimates of gene-specific global dN/dS ratios showed that all genes were subject to purifying selection. However, a total of 13 sites were detected under positive selection by at least two of three methods, which located within segments HA, NA, M2, NS1 and PA. Additionally, we inferred that NA segment has the highest rate of nucleotide substitution, and its tMRCA estimate is the youngest than the remaining segments' inference. About the spatial history, air transportation of human was identified as the predominant driver of global viral migration using GLM analysis, and economic factors and geographical distance were the modest predictors. Higher migration rates were estimated between five pairs of regions (>0.01) indicating the frequent migration of the viruses between discrete geographical locations. Further, our Markov jumps analysis showed that viral migration is more frequent between Southern China and Northern China, and high rate of gene flow was observed between America and East Asia. Moreover, the America together with Southeast Asia acted as the primary hubs of global transmission, forming the trunk of evolutionary tree. These findings suggested a complex interaction between virus evolution, epidemiology and human behaviour."

Modern industrial-scale animal feeding operations rely extensively on veterinary pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, to augment animal growth. Following excretion, antibiotics are transported through the environment via runoff, leaching, and land application of manure; however, airborne transport from feed yards has not been characterized. Objectives: The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), and ruminant-associated microbes are aerially dispersed via particulate matter (PM) derived from large-scale beef cattle feed yards. Methods: PM was collected downwind and upwind of 10 beef cattle feed yards. After extraction from PM, five veterinary anti-biotics were quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, ARG were quantified via targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and microbial community diversity was analyzed via 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. Results: Airborne PM derived from feed yards facilitated dispersal of several veterinary antibiotics, as well as microbial communities containing ARG. Concentrations of several antibiotics in airborne PM immediately downwind of feed yards ranged from 0.5 to 4.6 mu g/g of PM. Microbial communities of PM collected downwind of feed yards were enriched with ruminant-associated taxa and were distinct when compared to upwind PM assemblages. Furthermore, genes encoding resistance to tetracycline antibiotics were significantly more abundant in PM collected downwind of feed yards as compared to upwind. Conclusions: Wind-dispersed PM from feed yards harbors antibiotics, bacteria, and ARGs."

There is also an unusually large degree of antigenic variation among strains belonging to this species. The Mycoplasma has been isolated from a number of avian hosts, but in natural infections the main manifestation is mortality of turkey embryos in the later stages of incubation. In experimental infections some strains cause chick and turkey embryo mortality and, depending on the route of infection and the age of bird, can give rise to joint and bone abnormalities and occasional air sacculitis. In turkeys it is well known that the organism is egg-transmitted and can also spread laterally. In the mature bird the oviduct, semen and cloaca are sources of infection. Less is known about the natural infection in chickens. The humoral response in turkeys and chickens is poor and diagnosis is currently by culture although several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection methods have been developed. Eradication from some turkey breeder flocks has been achieved by treating eggs with fluoroquinolones, monitoring the progeny for infection, and imposing stringent hygiene measures, especially at artificial insemination."

For each treatment, samples included: feces just prior to euthanization; hides after euthanization; intestinal digesta from the lower digestive tract; carcasses immediately after evisceration and after 24 h in the chiller; and ground beef stored at 5 degrees C for 1 and 8 days. Samples were also collected from the abattoir environment and from air during hide removal. Total, ampicillin (Amp(r))-, and tetracycline (Tet(r))-resistant E coli were isolated on MacConkey agar or MacConkey agar containing ampicillin or tetracycline, respectively. Amp(r) and Tet(r) E coli were isolated from the feces and hides of all cattle. Compared to the control, the prevalence of Amp(r) (26.5\% vs. 7.9\%) and Tet(r) (50.9\% vs. 12.6\%) E. coli was greater in feces from AS700 treated animals (P<0.05), but was similar between treatments for hide samples (P>0.05). The prevalence of carcass or ground beef contamination with AR E. coli was not different between treatments. Resistant E. coli were isolated from the abattoir environment after processing of both groups of cattle. Susceptibilities to 11 antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses were conducted on 360 Amp(r) and Tet(r) E. coli isolates. Twenty-five antibiogram profiles were detected, with isolates exhibiting resistance to up to 9 antimicrobials. Most (28.2\%) Amp(r) E coli were also resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline, whereas Tet(r) E. coli (53.5\%) were mainly resistant to only tetracycline. Thirty one genotypes were detected by PFGE with most isolates from meat and environmental samples having similar genetic profiles to isolates from hides or digesta. These data demonstrate that antimicrobial-resistant E coli can contaminate meat products during slaughter and enter the food chain regardless of whether or not cattle are administered AGP. The abundance of AR E. coli on the hides of animals is likely a key element for controlling end-product contamination. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V, All rights reserved."

Most cases result from airborne transmission of already resistant TB strains. Epidemic control relies on rapid diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment to reduce the period of infectiousness and ongoing transmission. The rapid diagnostic test, Xpert MTB/RIF, has replaced smear microscopy for routine screening of all cases of presumptive TB in SA. Xpert also detects rifampicin (RIF) resistance, an indicator of more extensive drug resistance, allowing rapid initiation of effective secondline treatment. Definitive diagnosis of DR-TB relies on laboratory confirmation of MTB, along with drug-susceptibility testing (DST) using culture-based (phenotypic) and/or molecular (genotypic) techniques. A standardised treatment regimen, consisting of five (or six) drugs (pyrazinamide, (ethambutol), kanamycin, moxifloxacin, ethionamide, terizidone), is offered to individuals following initial diagnosis of RIF resistance. Treatment regimens are individualised if and when molecular mutation details and second-line DST results indicate more extensive second-line drug resistance. DR-TB treatment outcomes are poor owing to death, and interruption and failure of current treatment. Reliable access to newer, more effective drugs within shorter, more tolerable regimens is desperately needed to improve the chance of a cure for DR-TB patients.  2014, South African Medical Association.

LCC MCS were exposed to paclitaxel (PTX) in media whereas AIC MCS were exposed to dry powder PEGylated phospholipid aerosol microparticles containing paclitaxel. The difference in viability for 2D versus 3D culture for both LCC and AIC was evaluated along with the effects of the particles on lung epithelium via transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. For LCC and AIC conditions, the 3D spheroids were more resistant to treatment with higher IC50 values for A549 and H358 cell lines. TEER results initially indicated a decrease in resistance upon drug or particle exposure, however, these values increased over the course of several days indicating the ability of the cells to recover.

The largest transporter gene family is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) family is comprised of nine related ABC transporters. The intra-cellular distribution of the different MRP isoforms in relation to their physiological and non physiological function is still a point of discussion. For this purpose we used normal human lung cells (bronchial epithelial cells, NHBEC, and peripheral lung cells, PLC) as well as tumor cell cultures as test tools to investigate the intracelluar localization of these proteins under classical culture conditions and under air-liquid interface by means of indirect fluorescence microscopy. Characterization of the cultured cells as lung epithelial cells was performed by means of immuno-histochemical analysis. MRP1 and MRP3 were localised to the cellular membrane in all tested lung cell types. In contrast to that MRP2, MRP4 and MRP5 could be described as intracellular proteins in NHBEC and PLC. All MRP1-MRP5 isoforms could be characterized in A549 tumor cell line as membrane proteins. In order to imitate the physiological in vivo circumstances in the lung, we have established a dry/wet method (air-liquid interface) for cell cultivation so that cultured cells have the option to polarize between air and basal membrane and this might influence the distribution pattern of MRP1 and MRP2 in NHBEC. Using confocal laser scanning techniques we could show that in cells kept under dry/wet conditions MRP1 was found to be localised to baso-lateral cell regions while MRP2 was localised to all cell regions. Under classical culture conditions MRP1 was not localized to particular membrane regions and MRP2 was found to be an intracellular protein. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

We found no resistance to mancozeb, a nonspecific fungicide widely used in agriculture for more than half a century, in 215 Alternaria alternata isolates sampled from geographic locations along a climatic gradient and cropping system representing diverse ecotypes in China, consistent with low resistance risk in many nonspecific fungicides. Genetic variance accounts for similar to 35\% of phenotypic variation, while genotype-environment interaction is negligible, suggesting that heritability plays a more important role in the evolution of resistance to mancozeb in plant pathogens than phenotypic plasticity. We also found that tolerance to mancozeb in agricultural ecosystem is under constraining selection and significantly associated with local air temperature, possibly resulting from a pleiotropic effect of resistance with thermal and other ecological adaptations.

Despite of aggressive retreatment chemotherapy, the results are often unsuccessful, with a failure rate approaching 40%. Recently, there has been a revival of resectional surgery for the treatment of multidrug- resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: A retrospective analyses of the case records and radiographic findings were done. Between January 1991 and December 1995, 14 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative patients with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis were selected for resection to supplement chemotherapy. All patients had organisms resistent to many of the first-line drugs, including both isoniazid and rifampin. Results: Despite of aggressive therapy for median duration of 9.5 months, 12 of the 14 patients (86%) were still sputum smear and/or culture positive at the time of surgery. The disease was generally extensive. Although main lesions of the disease including thick-walled cavities were localized in one lung, lesser amounts of contralateral disease were demonstrated in 10 of 14 (71%). Types of surgery performed were pneumonectomy including extrapleural pneumonectomy in six patients, lobectomy or lobectomy plus in six patients, and segmentectomy in two patients. The resected lung appeared to have poor function ; preoperative perfusion lung scan showed only 4.8% of the total perfusion to the resected portion of the lung. There were no operative deaths. Two patients had major postoperative complications including empyema with bronchopleural fistula and prolonged air leak, respectively. Of the 14 patients, 13 (93%) remained sputum-culture-negative for M. tuberculosis for a median duration of 23 months and one remained continuously sputum smear and culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Conclusion: On the basis of comparison with historical controls, adjunctive resectional surgery appears to play a significant beneficial role in the management of patients with multidrug- resistant pulmonary tuberculosis if the disease is localized and there are adequate reserve in pulmonary function."

The antilisterial properties of EOs (thyme, oregano, and rosemary), in combination with different storage atmospheres (air, 5% CO2-2% O2-93% N2, and 20% CO2-1% O2-79% N2) and temperatures (4 and 80C), were examined using a gas flow-through system combined with a vegetable agar model. The antimicrobial effects of the EOs varied depending on the oil, the Listeria strain and species, the method of application, and the storage conditions tested. Using the disk diffusion assay, the antilisterial effectiveness of the oils was in the following order: thyme EO > oregano EO > rosemary EO. Volatiles released from the EOs resulted in very small antilisterial effects, indicating that the oils needed to be in direct contact with cultures in order to be effective. There were strain and species effects, with L. innocua NCTC 11288 exhibiting the strongest resistance to EOs, and L. monocytogenes NCTC 7973 being the most sensitive strain. In addition, the effectiveness of the EOs was influenced by storage atmosphere and temperature. Use of EOs in combination with a gas atmosphere of 20% CO2-1% O2-79% N2 had the greatest antilisterial effect, suggesting that high CO2 atmospheres enhanced the antilisterial properties of EOs. Lowering the storage temperature from 8 to 4OC improved the antilisterial activity of thyme oil. It is concluded that thyme and oregano EOs display strong inhibitory effects against Listeria and that increasing CO2 levels and lowering storage temperatures further enhance these antilisterial effects."

Transport of these pharmaceuticals has generally been assumed to be via manure land application, surface runoff, or groundwater percolation. However, veterinary pharmaceuticals in airborne particulate matter downwind of beef cattle feedyards have recently been documented, indicating that aerial transport and deposition are a potential transport mechanism in arid and semi-arid environments. In this study, 35 hydrologically discrete playa wetlands within 15 km of beef cattle feedyards were examined for occurrence of six steroid hormones and eight antibiotics. 17 alpha-trenbolone, estrone, estradiol, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, tylosin, and monensin were all detected in either water or sediment samples. Concentrations for the majority of analytes were < 15 ng/g in sediment and < 70 ng/L in water. Tylosin and monensin were detected at highest concentrations in water, at 3 and 84 mu g/L, respectively. A correlation between distance from the nearest beef cattle feedyard and concentration of monensin in playa water was observed, similar to correlations observed between pharmaceutical concentrations and distance from feedyard among air samples collected downwind of feedyards. This study suggests that airborne transport and deposition of pharmaceutical-laden particulate matter are a possible contributor to pharmaceutical concentrations in aquatic systems. Aerial deposition of pharmaceutical-laden particulate matter, not typically included in risk assessments, is of yet poorly characterized but may play a significant role in pharmaceutical transport in arid and semi-arid locations and deserves further investigation."

The initial E. faecalis SCV isolate formed small colonies on sheep blood agar plates and tiny colonies on chocolate and modified Drigalski agar, although no visible growth was observed in HK-semi solid medium after 48 h incubation in ambient air. Moreover, the SCV isolate, the colonial morphology of which was reminiscent of Streptococcus species, could not be identified using the MicroScan WalkAway-40 and API 20 Strep systems, both of which yielded profile numbers that did not correspond to any bacterial species, probably as a result of insufficient growth of the isolate. The SCV isolate was subsequently identified as E. faecalis based on its morphological, cultural and biochemical properties, and this was confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene of the organism. Investigations revealed that the addition of oleate, an unsaturated fatty acid, enabled the isolate to grow on every medium with normal-sized colony morphology. Although it has long been known that long-chain fatty acids, especially unsaturated oleic acid, have a major inhibitory effect on the growth of a variety of microorganisms, including not only mycobacteria but also streptococci, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinical isolation of an oleate-dependent E. faecalis SCV isolate.

Drug-resistant strains often undergo mutations, adopt alternative pathways, and express drug efflux pumps to reduce or eliminate drug doses. Besides these intrinsic resistance mechanisms, bacteria can evade drug doses by forming biofilms. Biofilms are the concerted growth of adherent microorganisms, which can also be formed at the air-water interface. The growth is supported by the extracellular polymer matrix which is self-produced by the microorganisms. Reduced metabolic activity in a nutrient-deficient environment in the biofilm may cause the microorganisms to take alternative pathways that can make the microorganisms recalcitrant to the drug doses. Recent works have shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses several proteins during its growth in biofilm, those when deleted, did not show any effect on mycobacterial growth in normal nutrient-sufficient conditions. Studying these unconventional proteins in mycobacterial biofilms is therefore of utmost importance. In this article, I will discuss one such mycobacterial biofilm-related protein FabG4 that is recently shown to be important for mycobacterial survival in the presence of antibiotic stressors and limited nutrient condition.

Three successive broiler flocks from six Belgian farms were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter spp. during the rearing period. Each flock was visited four times, before and after the outdoor rearing period. During each visit, samples were taken in the broiler house (litter, cecal droppings, water-lines, feed, anteroom) as well as from the outer rearing environment (open-air range). The Campylobacter detection in all samples was carried out according to the ISO 10272 standard. Identification was based on colonial morphology, microscopic examination, and biochemical tests. PCR multiplex was used for genetic confirmation. Campylobacter jejuni was the main species isolated from all contaminated samples. Overall, mixed infections C. jejuni/Campylobacter coli represented 40.6\%, while C. jejuni and C. coli represented 46.9\% and 12.5\% of chicken samples respectively. A 100\% flock contamination was observed in the 6 farms during the summer-autumn period, whereas only 66.7\% and 33.3\% of the flocks became Campylobacter-positive in spring and winter respectively, at the end of the rearing period. Half of contaminated flocks were infected before chickens have access to the open-air range. Environmental samples, especially the open-air range soil, were found to be Campylobacter-positive before flock infection. The other potential sources of contamination were delivery tray, anteroom floor and water-lines. Other animal productions like cattle on the farm, no applied rodent control, no cleaning and disinfection of water-lines between flocks, no detergent used for cleaning and thinning were recorded as risk factors. In conclusion, the contact with the environment, particularly the access to an open-air range, appeared to be the major way of Campylobacter contamination of chickens in free-range broiler production."

RESULTS: Respondents' hospitals (210 {[}58\%]) had a median of 2,400 healthcare workers (range, 396 to 13,745), 437 beds (range, 48 to 1,250), 5.6 patients with TB per year (range, 0 to 499), and 0 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients per year (range, 0 to 33). Of 166 respondents' hospitals for which data were provided for 1989 through 1992, the number caring for MDR-TB patients increased from 10 (6\%) in 1989 to 49 (30\%) in 1992. Reported policies for routine healthcare worker tuberculin skin testing varied. The median skin-test positivity rate for healthcare workers at the time of hire increased from 0.54\% in 1989 to 0.81\% in 1992, but the median conversion rate during routine testing remained similar: 0.35\% in 1989 and 0.33\% in 1992. Among 196 hospitals with reported data on respiratory protection use for 1989 through 1992, the use of either surgical submicron, dust-mist, or dust-fume-mist respirators for healthcare workers increased from 9 (5\%) in 1989 to 85 (43\%) in 1992.

The CAFOs had 10- to 100-times higher concentrations of airborne 16S rRNA, tet(X), and tet(W) genes than other environments sampled, and increased concentrations of aerosolized bacteria correlated with increased concentrations of airborne resistance genes. The two CAFOs studied had statistically similar concentrations of resistance genes in their aerosol samples, even though antibiotic use was markedly different between the two operations Additionally, tet(W) genes were recovered in outdoor air within 2 km of livestock operations, which suggests that antibiotic resistance genes may be transported via aerosols on local scales. The integrase gene (intI1) from Class 1 integrons, which has been associated with multidrug resistance, was detected in CAFOs but not in human occupied indoor environments, suggesting that CAFO aerosols could serve as a reservoir of multidrug resistance. In conclusion, our results show that CAFOs and clinics are sources of aerosolized antibiotic resistance genes that can potentially be transported via air movement."

We describe the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) before and after the implementation of aggressive infection control measures at the Air Force Theater Hospital in Iraq. Methods: All patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were followed prospectively for the development of VAP. Baseline VAP rate was determined in May 2006, and preventive measures were implemented by June 2006. Interventions included hand hygiene, contact barrier precautions, patient and staff cohorting, chlorhexidine oral care, and reducing the duration and spectrum of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis. Additionally, each ICU tent was closed periodically for cleaning and disinfection. Daily inspections provided ongoing staff education and enforcement of procedures. Monthly VAP rates were calculated and compared for trend. Results: There were 475 ICU admissions from May 2006 through August 2006 for a mean admission rate of 119 per month. The rate of VAP per 1,000 ventilator days was 60.6 in May, 31.6 in June, 21.3 in July, and 11.1 in August (p = 0.029). Targeted surveillance in November and December revealed VAP rates of 11.6 and 9.7, respectively. Notably, the most common bacteria, Acinetobacter, had improved antimicrobial susceptibilities after the interventions. Conclusions: Implementation of aggressive infection control procedures in a combat military hospital was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of VAP.

Worldwide, natural ventilation is the most common means of air disinfection, but it is inherently unreliable and of limited use in cold climates. Upper room germicidal ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection with air mixing has been shown to be highly effective, but improved evidence-based dosing guidelines are needed. Objectives: To test the efficacy of upper room germicidal air disinfection with air mixing to reduce tuberculosis transmission under real hospital conditions, and to define the application parameters responsible as a basis for proposed new dosing guidelines. Methods: Over an exposure period of 7 months, 90 guinea pigs breathed only untreated exhaust ward air, and another 90 guinea pigs breathed only air from the same six-bed tuberculosis ward on alternate days when upper room germicidal air disinfection was turned on throughout the ward. Measurements and Main Results: The tuberculin skin test conversion rates (>6 mm) of the two chambers were compared. The hazard ratio for guinea pigs in the control chamber converting their skin test to positive was 4.9 (95\% confidence interval, 2.8-8.6), with an efficacy of approximately 80\%. Conclusions: Upper room germicidal UV air disinfection with air mixing was highly effective in reducing tuberculosis transmission under hospital conditions.

Also disheartening is the rise of known infectious pathogens that have acquired extensive drug resistance and reemerged with greater virulence. More recently, the threat of bioweapons has rekindled an urgency for the development of mass immunization programs. In response to this increased infectious disease threat, efforts have been intensified to identify more effective, inexpensive, and more easily deliverable mucosal vaccination methods. One area of research currently under development is the genetic modification of plants for production of immunoprotective proteins. The ability of plants to synthesize complex proteins using the elements of sunlight, soil, air, and water makes them ideal organisms for harvesting large quantities of therapeutic proteins. The introduction of antigen or antibody encoding genes into the genome of a plant through stable transformation enables them to manufacture vaccine proteins that are directly applicable for use in disease treatment, unlike yeast, bacterial, insect or other expression systems that require purification steps before delivery. As an alternative to stable transformation, plants can be used to generate large quantities of vaccines by acting as hosts for genetically altered plant viruses in which antigen proteins can be expressed and later purified from infected plant tissues. In this review, we survey current experimental strategies for using edible plants to achieve passive and active immunization against infectious disease organisms. In addition, methods are described for the construction of transformed plants that can provide protection against autoimmune diseases. Concerns and present obstacles to effective immunization with plant-based vaccines for animals and humans are presented."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis was quantified in pretreatment sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis using FDA microscopy, culture, and acid-fast microscopy. These 35 patients' 209 household contacts were followed with prevalence surveys for tuberculosis disease for 6 years. Results. FDA microscopy was positive for a median of 119 (interquartile range {[}IQR], 47-386) bacteria/mu L sputum, which was 5.1\% (IQR, 2.4\%-11\%) the concentration of acid-fast microscopy-positive bacteria (2069 {[}IQR, 1358-3734] bacteria/mu L). Tuberculosis was diagnosed during follow-up in 6.4\% (13/209) of contacts. For patients with lower than median concentration of FDA microscopy-positive M. tuberculosis, 10\% of their contacts developed tuberculosis. This was significantly more than 2.7\% of the contacts of patients with higher than median FDA microscopy results (crude hazard ratio {[}HR], 3.8; P = .03). This association maintained statistical significance after adjusting for disease severity, chemoprophylaxis, drug resistance, and social determinants (adjusted HR, 3.9; P = .02). Conclusions.

Recommendations and reports : Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Recommendations and reports / Centers for Disease Control","39","1","?",NA,"The transmission of tuberculosis is a recognized risk in health-care settings. Several recent outbreaks of tuberculosis in health-care settings, including outbreaks involving multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have heightened concern about nosocomial transmission. In addition, increases in tuberculosis cases in many areas are related to the high risk of tuberculosis among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Transmission of tuberculosis to persons with HIV infection is of particular concern because they are at high risk of developing active tuberculosis if infected. Health-care workers should be particularly alert to the need for preventing tuberculosis transmission in settings in which persons with HIV infection receive care, especially settings in which cough-inducing procedures (e.g., sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine [AP] treatments) are being performed. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients with unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis who are not on effective antituberculosis therapy and have not been placed in tuberculosis (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) isolation. Health-care facilities in which persons at high risk for tuberculosis work or receive care should periodically review their tuberculosis policies and procedures, and determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk of tuberculosis transmission in their particular settings. The prevention of tuberculosis transmission in health-care settings requires that all of the following basic approaches be used: a) prevention of the generation of infectious airborne particles (droplet nuclei) by early identification and treatment of persons with tuberculous infection and active tuberculosis, b) prevention of the spread of infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation by applying source-control methods, c) reduction of the number of infectious droplet nuclei in air contaminated with them, and d) surveillance of health-care-facility personnel for tuberculosis and tuberculous infection. Experience has shown that when inadequate attention is given to any of these approaches, the probability of tuberculosis transmission is increased. Specific actions to reduce the risk of tuberculosis transmission should include a) screening patients for active tuberculosis and tuberculous infection, b) providing rapid diagnostic services, c) prescribing appropriate curative and preventive therapy, d) maintaining physical measures to reduce microbial contamination of the air, e) providing isolation rooms for persons with, or suspected of having, infectious tuberculosis, f) screening health-care-facility personnel for tuberculous infection and tuberculosis, and g) promptly investigating and controlling outbreaks. Although completely eliminating the risk of tuberculosis transmission in all health-care settings may be impossible, adhering to these guidelines should minimize the risk to persons in these settings."

Viral respiratory tract infections are strongly associated with asthma exacerbation, but the effects of respiratory viruses on airway epithelial barrier function are not well understood. Many viruses generate double-stranded RNA, which can lead to airway inflammation and initiate an antiviral immune response. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of the synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) on the structure and function of the airway epithelial barrier in vitro. METHODS: 16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cells and primary airway epithelial cells at an air-liquid interface were grown to confluence on Transwell inserts and exposed to polyI:C. We studied epithelial barrier function by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and paracellular flux of fluorescent markers and structure of epithelial apical junctions by means of immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: PolyI:C induced a profound decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and increase in paracellular permeability. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed markedly reduced junctional localization of zonula occludens-1, occludin, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and disorganization of junction-associated actin filaments. PolyI:C induced protein kinase D (PKD) phosphorylation, and a PKD antagonist attenuated polyI:C-induced disassembly of apical junctions and barrier dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: PolyI:C has a powerful and previously unsuspected disruptive effect on the airway epithelial barrier. PolyI:C-dependent barrier disruption is mediated by disassembly of epithelial apical junctions, which is dependent on PKD signaling. These findings suggest a new mechanism potentially underlying the associations between viral respiratory tract infections, airway inflammation, and allergen sensitization."

Before the availability of antimicrobial drugs the cornerstone of treatment was rest in the open air in sanatoria. The major breakthrough in treatment of tuberculosis came with the discovery of Streptomycin. Later, INH, Ethambutol. Pyrazinamide, Rifampicin were added to the arsenal. Objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis against two second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Department of Microbiology. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) Rawalpindi. All routine clinical samples received for acid fast bacilli (AFB) in the Department of Microbiology. AFIP, Rawalpindi were processed by modified Petroff's technique and inoculated on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) medium and Bactec 460 Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture system. After identification of M. tuberculosis sensitivity was performed against first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Then susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates against Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin was performed on LJ medium. H37Rv was used as control strain. RESULTS: Results were interpreted using resistance ratio method. Out of 100 M. tuberculosis isolates, 98% were sensitive to Amikacin and 97% to Ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin are very effective 2nd line anti-tuberculosis drugs against tuberculosis isolates in our set-up."

To describe the course and management of a protracted outbreak after intercontinental transfer of 2 patients colonized with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB). DESIGN. An 18-month outbreak investigation. SETTING. An 860-bed university hospital in France. PATIENTS. Case patients (ie, carriers) were those colonized or infected with an MDRAB isolate. METHODS. During the epidemic period, all intensive care unit (ICU) patients and contacts of carriers who were transferred to wards were screened for MDRAB carriage. Contact precautions, environmental screening, and auditing of healthcare worker (HCW) practices were implemented; rooms were cleaned with hydrogen peroxide mist disinfection. One ICU, in which most of the cases occurred, was closed on 4 occasions for thorough cleaning and disinfection. RESULTS. The 2 index case patients were identified as 2 patients who carried the same MDRAB strain and who were admitted to the hospital after repatriation from Tahiti 5 months apart. During an 18-month period, a total of 84 secondary cases occurred. Reintroduction of MDRAB into the ICUs occurred from patients previously colonized or from healthcare personnel. Termination of the outbreak was only achieved when all carriers from wards or the ICU were cohorted to an isolation unit with dedicated healthcare personnel. CONCLUSIONS. Intercontinental transfer of carriers of MDRAB can result in extensive outbreaks and serious disruption of the hospital's organization. Transmission from carriers most likely occurred via the hands of HCWs, poor cleaning protocols, airborne spread, and contaminated water from sink traps. This protracted outbreak was controlled only after implementation of an extensive control program and eventual cohorting of all carriers in an isolation unit with dedicated healthcare personnel.

Their roles in maggot therapy for treating chronic wound infection have been reported recently. However, a relatively narrow antibacterial spectrum together with the lack of a cost-effective means of commercial-scale production has limited their application. To further exploit the therapeutic potential of these molecules, we engineered the carboxyl-terminal beta-sheet of navidefensin2-2, an insect defensin from Nasonia vitripennis, based on its structural similarity to naturally occurring microbicidal beta-hairpin peptides. The designed peptide of 14 residues, referred to as N nu BH, spans the beta-sheet region of the defensin with two amino acids substituted for assembly of a disulfide-bonded amphipathic beta-hairpin structure. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with circular dichroism (CD) analysis shows that the oxidized N nu BH (oN nu BH), produced from the synthetic peptide by air oxidization in an alkaline environment, folds into a typical beta-hairpin structure linked by two disulfide bridges (Cys1-Cys4; Cys2-Cys3). However, such a structure appears not to be functionally necessary as synthetic N nu BH with a spontaneously oxidized disulfide bridge (Cys2-Cys3) (termed poN nu BH) displayed similar antibacterial potency to oN nu BH. In comparison with oN nu BH, poN nu BH exhibited higher serum stability and more resistance on tryptic digestion. These two forms of peptides are capable of killing an array of Gram-positive (including antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus) and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens at low micromolar concentrations through a membrane disruptive mode of action. Our work indicates that the beta-sheet region of insect defensins is a promising subdomain of proteins in anti-infective drug discovery."

These photocatalysts have a range of applications including disinfection, air and water cleaning, deodorization, and pollution and environmental control. Titanium dioxide is a chemically stable and inert material, and can continuously exert antimicrobial effects when illuminated. The energy source could be solar light; therefore, TiO2 photocatalysts are also useful in remote areas where electricity is insufficient. However, because of its large band gap for excitation, only biohazardous ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation can excite TiO2, which limits its application in the living environment. To extend its application, impurity doping, through metal coating and controlled calcination, has successfully modified the substrates of TiO2 to expand its absorption wavelengths to the visible light region. Previous studies have investigated the antibacterial abilities of visible light-responsive photocatalysts using the model bacteria Escherichia coli and human pathogens. The modified TiO2 photocatalysts significantly reduced the numbers of surviving bacterial cells in response to visible light illumination. They also significantly reduced the activity of bacterial endospores; reducing their toxicity while retaining their germinating abilities. It is suggested that the photocatalytic killing mechanism initially damages the surfaces weak points of the bacterial cells, before totally breakage of the cell membranes. The internal bacterial components then leak from the cells through the damaged sites. Finally, the photocatalytic reaction oxidizes the cell debris. In summary, visible light-responsive TiO2 photocatalysts are more convenient than the traditional UV light-responsive TiO2 photocatalysts because they do not require harmful UV light irradiation to function. These photocatalysts, thus, provide a promising and feasible approach for disinfection of pathogenic bacteria; facilitating the prevention of infectious diseases."

It can be defined as a bacterial growth and replication on the prosthetic joint surface resulting in periprosthetic tissue damage and prosthesis loosening. The implants are colonized by airborne-, skin-, tool-, and/ or surgeon-related bacteria during surgery even though majority of procedures are performed under strictly respected conditions nowadays. After the insertion of the prosthesis into the human body the race between bacteria and host cells begins on what will colonize the prosthetic surface first. If the bacteria are more successful then they develop on formation of biofilm which is the biological correlative for the prosthetic joint infection (PJI) resisting effectively against host immune response and antibiotics. That is why preventative measures are strongly worth to do it, and removal of the prosthesis is the single optimal treatment. Each step in the pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infection may represent relevant targets against which prevention strategies may be directed. Of them the most useful seems to be identification of individual factors predisposing for PJI development, antibiotic prophylaxis given before the surgery, and operating room/ surgical quality parameters.

Quantitative beta-lactamase assays demonstrated a significant (P < 0.0001) increase in enzymatic activity between bacteria cultivated in 5\% CO2 over those incubated in ambient air. The presence of beta-lactamase genes bla(TEM) and bla(SHV) was detected in the clinical isolate F. philomiragia 14IUHPL001 by PCR, and the genes were positively identified by nucleotide sequencing.

To characterize animal and environmental routes of worker exposure, we optimized methods to identify S. aureus on operations that raise swine in confinement with antibiotics (industrial hog operation: IHO) versus on pasture without antibiotics (antibiotic-free hog operation: AFHO). We associated findings from tested swine and environmental samples with those from personal inhalable air samplers on worker surrogates at one IHO and three AFHOs in North Carolina using a new One Health approach. We determined swine S. aureus carriage status by collecting swab samples from multiple anatomical sites, and we determined environmental positivity for airborne bioaerosols with inhalable and impinger samplers and a single-stage impactor (ambient air) cross-sectionally. All samples were analyzed for S. aureus, and isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, absence of scn (livestock marker), and spa type. Seventeen of twenty (85\%) swine sampled at the one IHO carried S. aureus at > 1 anatomical sites compared to none of 30 (0\%) swine sampled at the three AFHOs. All S. aureus isolates recovered from IHO swine and air samples were scn negative and spa type t337; almost all isolates (62/63) were multidrug resistant. S. aureus was recovered from eight of 14 (67\%) ambient air and two (100\%) worker surrogate personal air samples at the one IHO, whereas no S. aureus isolates were recovered from 19 ambient and six personal air samples at the three AFHOs. Personal worker surrogate inhalable sample findings were consistent with both swine and ambient air data, indicating the potential for workplace exposure. IHO swine and the one IHO environment could be a source of potential pathogen exposure to workers, as supported by the detection of multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) with livestock-associated spa type t337 among swine, worker surrogate personal air samplers and environmental air samples at the one IHO but none of the three AFHOs sampled in this study. Concurrent sampling of swine, personal swine worker surrogate air, and ambient airborne dust demonstrated that IHO workers may be exposed through both direct (animal contact) and indirect (airborne) routes of transmission.

However, reliable in vitro evaluation methods for bacterial contact-killing surfaces do not yet exist. More importantly, results of different evaluation methods are often conflicting. Therefore, we compared five methods to evaluate contact-killing surfaces. To this end, we have copolymerized quaternary-ammonium groups into diurethane dimethacrylate/glycerol dimethacrylate (UDMA/GDMA) and determined contact-killing efficacies against five different Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Spray-coating bacteria from an aerosol onto contact-killing surfaces followed by air-drying as well as ASTM E2149-13a (American Society for Testing and Materials) were found unsuitable, while the Petrifilm(R) system and JIS Z 2801 (Japanese Industrial Standards) were found to be excellent methods to evaluate bacterial contact-killing surfaces. It is recommended however, that these methods be used in combination with a zone of inhibition on agar assay to exclude that leakage of antimicrobials from the material interferes with the contact-killing ability of the surface. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bacterial adhesion to surfaces of biomaterials implants can be life-threatening. Antimicrobials to treat biomaterial-associated infections often fail due to the bacterial biofilm-mode-of-growth or are ineffective due to antibiotic-resistance of causative organisms. Positively-charged, quaternized surfaces can kill bacteria upon contact and are promising as a non-antibiotic-based treatment of biomaterial-associated infections. Reliable methods to determine efficacies of contact-killing surfaces are lacking, however. Here, we show that three out of five methods compared, including an established ASTM, are unsuitable. Methods found suitable should be used in combination with a zone-of-inhibition-assay to establish absence of antimicrobial leaching, potentially interfering with contact-killing. Identification of suitable assays for evaluating bacterial contact-killing will greatly assist this emerging field as an alternative for antibiotic-based treatment of biomaterial-associated-infections."

Daily fecal E. coli K88 counts were not different (P > 0.05) among treatments, but fecal shedding of carbadox-resistant coliforms was higher (P < 0.01) during the 9-d period in pigs fed carbadox. Total fecal coliforms were consistently lower throughout the postinoculation period in pigs fed yeast (P < 0.05). Yeast reduced colonization oftotal coliforms in the duodenum,jejunum, cecum, and colon, but it did not have a consistent effect on colonization of E. coli K88. Pigs fed yeast tended (P < 0.10) to have higher serum IgG levels than controls. In these experiments, brewers dried yeast and carbadox had minimal effects on growth, microbial populations, and intestinal health traits of early-weaned pigs, but certain serum immunological traits were enhanced by feeding yeast."

DESIGN: Prospective surveillance of patients with MRSA infections or colonizations was performed, as was an observational study of environmental airAirborne samples were taken by an air sampler; samples were obtained from object surfaces by stamping or swabbing. Epidemiological study of MRSA isolates was performed with an antibiotic susceptibility test, coagulase typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. SETTING: Three single-patient rooms in a 37-bed otolaryngology-head and neck surgery unit. PATIENTS: Three patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer were observed to have been colonized or infected with MRSA after surgery. RESULTS: The MRSA samples were collected from the air in single-patient rooms during both a period of rest and when bedsheets were being changed. Isolates of MRSA were detected in all stages (from stage 1 [>7 microm] to stage 6 [0.65-1.1 microm]). About 20% of the MRSA particles were within a respirable range of less than 4 microm. Methicillin-resistant S aureus was also isolated from inanimate environments, such as sinks, floors, and bedsheets, in the rooms of the patients with MRSA infections as well as from the patients' hands. An epidemiological study demonstrated that clinical isolates of MRSA in our ward were of one origin and that the isolates from the air and from inanimate environments were identical to the MRSA strains that caused infection or colonization in the inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin-resistant S aureus was recirculated among the patients, the air, and the inamimate environments, especially when there was movement in the rooms. Airborne MRSA may play a role in MRSA colonization in the nasal cavity or in respiratory tract MRSA infections. Measures should be taken to prevent the spread of airborne MRSA to control nosocomial MRSA infection in hospitals."

Saponins are secondary metabolites that are found in various plant species. The aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial activity of saponins extracted from the Glycyrrhiza glabra and Acanthopyllum squarrusom against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results were compared to data of Quillaja saponaria as a commercial saponin. The roots of the plants were dried, powdered and def-fatted with petroleum ether in a soxhlet apparatus. The air dried powder was successively extracted with methanol, n-butanol and diethyl ether. The antibacterial activity of the saponins was determined using well diffusion method and also the value of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) was evaluated by 96-well microtiter plates. Ampicillin and gentamicin were used as positive controls to determine the sensitivity of the strains. According to the results, the best growth inhibitory activity was observed with saponin of G. glabra, while saponin fraction of A. squarrusom and Q. saponaria showed less activity against bacteria. The zone inhibition of the saponin extract from G. glabra was 40.00+/-0.00 mm for E. coli, 35.00+/-0.00 for S. aureus, 34.00+/-0.05 for P. aeruginosa and 30.00+/-0.00 for P. mirabilis. The value of MIC of saponin of G. glabra against E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was 3.12 mg/ml, and against P. mirabilis was 25 mg/ml, whereas saponins of A. squarrusom and Q. saponaria were found comparatively less effective against bacterial pathogens. The results of the study indicated that saponin of G. glabra has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and can be used as a natural antimicrobial agent."

I: In Vitro Studies","PLOS ONE","8","1","?","10.1371/journal.pone.0076968","Background: 0.5\% to 10\% of clean surgeries result in surgical-site infections, and attempts to reduce this rate have had limited success. Germicidal UV lamps, with a broad wavelength spectrum from 200 to 400 nm are an effective bactericidal option against drug-resistant and drug-sensitive bacteria, but represent a health hazard to patient and staff. By contrast, because of its limited penetration, similar to 200 nm far-UVC light is predicted to be effective in killing bacteria, but without the human health hazards to skin and eyes associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure. Aims: The aim of this work was to test the biophysically-based hypothesis that,200 nm UV light is significantly cytotoxic to bacteria, but minimally cytotoxic or mutagenic to human cells either isolated or within tissues. Methods: A Kr-Br excimer lamp was used, which produces 207-nm UV light, with a filter to remove higher-wavelength components. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional broad spectrum 254-nm UV germicidal lamp. First, cell inactivation vs. UV fluence data were generated for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria and also for normal human fibroblasts. Second, yields of the main UV-associated pre-mutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) were measured, for both UV radiations incident on 3-D human skin tissue. Results: We found that 207-nm UV light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps, produces little cell killing in human cells. In a 3-D human skin model, 207-nm UV light produced almost no pre-mutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions, in contrast to significant yields induced by a conventional germicidal UV lamp. Conclusions: As predicted based on biophysical considerations, 207-nm light kills bacteria efficiently but does not appear to be significantly cytotoxic or mutagenic to human cells. Used appropriately, 207-nm light may have the potential for safely and inexpensively reducing surgical-site infection rates, including those of drug-resistant origin."

The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of light used in phototherapy on antibiotic resistance in prokaryotic cells using tester strains of gentamicin-sensitive Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. A growing population of the tester microorganisms was inoculated on plates containing nutrient medium and gentamicin. Experiments were performed to determine the effect of blue light on the induction of gentamicin- resistant mutants. The plates were divided into two populations, one of which was illuminated, while the other was kept in the dark to serve as a control. During photoirradiation, the plates were protected from direct sunlight and air cooled to maintain a temperature of 27C. The sample distance from the light source was adjusted to maintain a fluence rate (450 urn) of 141 uW/cm2. Control experiments were performed to investigate the effect of photoirradiation on the media and gentamicin. An increased frequency of mutation to gentamicin resistance was seen in the irradiated population of bacteria. The mutagenic effect was observed over a wide range of gentamicin concentrations and correlated in a linear fashion with increasing duration of photoirradiation. There was an inverse correlation between the size of the bacterial inoculum and the recovery of mutant bacteria. Speculation: In view of the demonstrated ability of high-intensity visible light to modify intracellular DNA and induce mutations in bacterial populations, the relationship between the widespread use of phototherapy and the emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria in nursery populations needs to be determined.  1981 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc."

The subjects were required to be on a stable and therapeutic dose of psychotropic medication for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and their treatment had to be insufficiently effective. Their clinical state was monitored at the baseline and at the end of treatment. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 items (HDRS-21), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression (PGI) were used. The results were analyzed with an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Results: Ninety-five patients were enrolled (50 diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 45 with unipolar depression). Fifty-two patients were randomized to treatment with BLT and forty-three were in the placebo group (ITT population). Eighty-three subjects completed the study. There were 12 dropouts (5 in the light group and 7 in the placebo group). After 14 days of treatment, a significant improvement was found in all groups (p<0.001). The subjects treated with BLT did not significantly differ in terms of improvement in HDRS-21 scores at the endpoint when compared to patients treated with placebo (p=02). However, further analysis demonstrated significantly higher response (50\% v. 27.9\%, p=0.02) and remission rates (28.8\% v. 11.6\%, p=0.04) among patients treated with morning BLT when compared to placebo group. It should be noted that in the population of drug-resistant patients, BLT was more efficacious than placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between unipolar and bipolar disorders (p=0.4). Conclusion: Although overall improvement in HDRS-21 scores were not superior in the BLT group, both response and remission rates were significantly higher among patients treated with BLT relative to those receiving the sham intervention. BLT was also more efficacious than placebo in the population of patients with drug-resistant depression.

The ethno-medicinal use against yellow fever, jaundice and diarrhea prompted us to investigate on the antiviral activity of the root bark of N. latifolia. In this study, HSV-2 was chosen as a viral model because of its strong impact on HIV transmission and acquisition. METHODS: The crude extract under study was prepared by maceration of air-dried and powdered roots barks of N. latifolia in CH2Cl2/MeOH (50:50) mixture for 48 hours, then it was subjected to filtration and evaporation under vacuum. A phytochemical analysis of the crude extract was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with a photodiode array and mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-ESI-qMS). The anti-HSV-2 activity was assayed in vitro by plaque reduction and virus yield assays and the major mechanism of action was investigated by virucidal and time of addition assays. Data values were compared using the Extra sum of squares F test of program GraphPad PRISM 4. RESULTS: The main components detected in the extract belong to the class of indole alkaloids characteristic of Nauclea genus. Strictosamide, vincosamide and pumiloside were tentatively identified together with quinovic acid glycoside. N. latifolia crude extract inhibited both acyclovir sensitive and acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains, with IC50 values of 5.38 mug/ml for the former and 7.17 mug/ml for the latter. The extract was found to be most active when added post-infection, with IC50 of 3.63 mug/ml. CONCLUSION: The results of this work partly justify the empirical use of N. latifolia in traditional medicine for the treatment of viral diseases. This extract could be a promising rough material for the development of a new and more effective modern anti-HSV-2 medication also active against acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 strains."

It is often used against non-combatant targets. Terror tactics may include biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events. Biologic Bioterrorism is the intentional release of biological agents to cause illness or death in humans, animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria, fungi, toxins, or viruses. They may be naturally occurring or human-modified. The agents are typically found in nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to increase their resistance to antibiotics, and ability to spread in the environment. Biological and chemical agents may be spread through the air, food, or water. Terrorists use biological agents because they are often difficult to detect and illness onset may be delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal. Bioterrorism agents are a common choice for terrorists because they easy and inexpensive to produce, easy to disseminate, and can cause widespread effects. The challenge with bioweapons is that they may affect both enemy and friendly forces. Terrorists use biologic weapons as a method of creating mass panic. In the history of humanity, the intentional infliction of casualties on civilians was considered inappropriate. Civilians are usually not attacked for their own sake unless they happen to be living or working in an area that has tactical or strategic value. Unfortunately, bioterrorism agents are difficult to control and affect military personnel as well as civilian men, woman, and children. In the last 100 years, the United States and the international community have experienced multiple acts of terrorism and bioterrorism which have targeted civilians. World War I: Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in France, Romania, Russia, and the United States by infecting horses and mules with glanders, a virulent disease. 1972: Two college students, Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera, were arrested for planning to poison the Chicago water supply with typhoid bacteria. 1984: The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh followers in Oregon attempted to affect a local election by infecting doorknobs and salad bars in restaurants with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. 1993: Aum Shinrikyo religious group released anthrax in Tokyo. 1995: Bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. 2001: Airline attack on the World Trade Center. 2001: Anthrax-laced of infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the US Congress. 2009: Medical center attack at a Fort Hood, Texas. 2014: Bombing of the Boston Marathon. Present: Multiple bombings worldwide. Chemical During World War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons that often affected the civilian population resulting in many deaths. Since this war, most countries have agreed not to use chemical and biologic weapons. Unfortunately, with our present age of terrorism from individuals, splinter groups, and dictators, there is an ever-present risk that these agents will be used. Nuclear To date, other than the dropping of nuclear bombs by the United States to end World War II, there have been no recent acts of nuclear attack or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is an act of terrorism in which a terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device. The possibility of terrorist organizations using nuclear is considered plausible as terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small amounts of fissile material, all low-concern, there is no credible evidence any terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the necessary multi-kilogram critical mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium required to make a nuclear weapon. Explosive It is, unfortunately, becoming a common event on an international scale when terrorists use explosive devices to inflict casualties on the civilian population. Terrorism Definitions What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty incident? The United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as ""an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons, whereby-in contrast to assassination-the direct targets of violence are not the main targets."" The Department of Defense defines terrorism as ""the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are usually political."" The Federal Emergency Management Agency defines terrorism as ""the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often use threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate publicity for their cause"". The US Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as ""the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives."" A mass casualty incident is defined terrorist act that generates more patients than available resources can manage using routine procedures. Terrorism is generally considered to be the use of force or violence outside the law to create fear among citizens with the intent to coerce some sort of action. Health professionals should be aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle for terrorists to strike fear into the hearts and minds of citizens in the hopes they will bend the will of the people to support their agendas. All health professionals need to be prepared for this potentially catastrophic event. [Aven et al. 2015]"

However, their filamentous growth present several problems during industrial processes. Among these problems oxygen transfer limitation is critical. In this chapter we present the role of oxygen in spectinomycin production by a Streptomyces species. Spectinomycin, a broad spectrum antibiotic effective against penicillin resistant gonorrhea, is an aminoglycoside constituted from two glucose moieties. Its bioproduction is strongly influenced by glucose and oxygen. We have shown that for a fixed dissolved oxygen concentration, there are two specific glucose concentrations which give maximum final titers of spectinomycin. The bi-modal maximum indicates the influence of two intermediate metabolites in spectinomycin biosynthesis. We propose a mechanism for spectinomycin biosynthesis and subsequently develop a model based on this mechanism. The proposed mechanism for spectinomycin biosynthesis is validated by successfully reconstructing the air flow rate profiles. A nonlinear systems theory technique termed External Differential Representation, is implemented to reconstruct the spectinomycin bioconversion process which then predicts the spectinomycin concentration from the air flow rate profile. This signifies that spectinomycin titers in industrial fed-batch processes can be controlled if a priori information about the air flow rate profile yielding maximum spectinomycin is available."

This study aimed to investigate the presence of environmental coagulase-positive staphylococci, their susceptibility profile, clonal relationship and ability to form biofilm. The 16S rRNA genes from CoPS isolates were analyzed, and their antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated using the agar dilution method in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The clonal profile was obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and biofilm formation was measured by a crystal violet retention assay. A total of 72 Staphylococcus spp. strains were isolated from air, metal surfaces, and nostrils from humans, dogs, cats, and birds. Three species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus (17\%), Staphylococcus intermedius (63\%), and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (21\%). Ninety three percent (93\%) of the strains were resistant to at least one of 13 tested antibiotics. S. pseudintermedius strains were the only resistant ones to methicillin while most of these isolates were multidrug-resistant, had significantly higher ability to form biofilm and PFGE grouped into seven different patterns, without showing clonal dispersion among animals and environmental isolates. This study suggests that dogs, cat, and air are environmental sources potentially carrying multidrug-resistant S. pseudintermedius, which survives in different environments through biofilm formation and multidrug resistance, characteristics that can be transmitted horizontally to other bacteria andexacerbate the problem of antibiotic resistance in humans.

The intracellular acrolein concentrations differ insignificantly: 0.61 muM for sensitive cells and 0.54 muM for resistant cells. Treatment with a physiological concentration of doxorubicin (0.5 muM) for 24 h at 37degreesC increased acrolein levels by factors of 2.6 and 1.9 for MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells, respectively.

Indoor air pollution produced by biomass cooking fuels in developing countries has been associated with acute and chronic lower respiratory diseases, but has not been identified as an occupational exposure among women. Objective. To examine the relationship between the use of biomass cooking fuels (mainly wood) and tuberculosis (TB) among women living in rural areas in Southern Mexico. Methods. We conducted a population based case-control study in the health jurisdiction of Orizaba, Mexico. Cases were all incident female pulmonary TB patients, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum, living in communities with fewer than 15 000 inhabitants, diagnosed between March 1995 and April 2003. Woodsmoke exposure was assessed by applying a standardized questionnaire (ATS-DLD-78 questionnaire). Controls were randomly selected from sex-matched neighbors. Appropriate IRB approval was obtained. Results. 42 TB cases and 84 community controls were recruited. Multivariate assessment showed that more than 20 years of exposure to smoke from biomass fuels was three times more frequent among cases than among controls {[}Odds ratio (OR): 3.3, 95\% confidence interval (CI):1.06-10.30, p = 0.03], after controlling for age, body mass, household crowding, years of formal education and tobacco use.

The disease started during the patient stay in Arizona, USA, and clinical symptoms persisted after his return to Poland. Acute coccidioidomycosis is one the clinical manifestations of Coccidioides immitis strain endemic infections occurring in the south-western regions of USA including California (mainly San Joaquin Valley), Western Texas, New Mexico and the desert areas of Arizona, and Central and South America. The native environment of Coccidioides immitis is soil penetrated by rodents. People, domestic and wild animals suffer from coccidioidomycosis. The infection rate in endemic areas is about 2-4% a year in the healthy population. Coccidioidomycosis can be observed in non-endemic areas due to population mobility and in immunocompromised patients. The Coccidioides immitis infection is caused by inhaled airborne fungal spores and it may occur as primary pulmonary (acute or chronic) asymptomatic form, meningitis, or disseminated disease. The clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycotis like acute pulmonary manifestations may resemble typical, resistant to empiric antibiotic treatment of bacterial pneumonia. In healthy subjects, pulmonary coccidioidomycosis may occur as asymptomatic infection, which resolves spontaneously without medication. Sometimes, slight shadows like local fibrosis and cavities may be visible on the chest X-ray. The Coccidioides immitis infection in people with immunological deficiency syndromes, e.g. HIV/AIDS, manifests itself as disseminated disease and may lead to severe complications including death."

In this study, we investigate the molecular-level mechanism of action for Labaditin (Lo), a 10-amino acid residue cyclic peptide from Jatropha multifida with known bactericidal activity against Streptococcus mutans. We show that Lo is also effective against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) but this does not apply to its linear analogue (L-1). Using polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), we observed with that the secondary structure of Lo was preserved upon interacting with Langmuir monolayers from a phospholipid mixture mimicking S. aureus membrane, in contrast to L-1. This structure preservation for the rigid, cyclic Lo is key for the self-assembly of peptide nanotubes that induce pore formation in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), according to permeability assays and dynamic light scattering measurements. In summary, the comparison between Labaditin (Lo) and its linear analogue L-1 allowed us to infer that the bactericidal activity of Lo is more related to its interaction with the membrane. It does not require specific metabolic targets, which makes cyclic peptides promising for antibiotics without bacteria resistance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the airborne Staphylococcus genus features in homes in which inhabitants have had contact with the hospital environment. Methods: Airborne bacteria were collected using a 6-stage Anderson impactor. The Staphylococcus species composition and resistance to methicillin, and other antimicrobial agents among 3 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species (S cohnii spp cohnii, S epidermidis, S hominis), were determined. Antibiotic resistance of isolates was tested using the agar screen method with methicillin, the polymerase chain reaction technique to detect the mecA gene, and the disk diffusion method. Results: A higher prevalence of methicillin-resistant (MR) strains among the species isolated (40\% of Sepidermidis, 40\% of Shominis, and 60\% of S cohnii spp cohnii) was found in homes of persons who had contact with a hospital environment compared with the reference homes (only 12\% of S hominis). The mecA gene was revealed in all MR S epidermidis strains and in some MR S hominis (50\%) and S cohnii spp cohnii (33\%) strains. All isolated MR CNS strains were susceptible to vancomycin, rifampicin, and linezolid. Conclusion: High numbers of airborne multidrug-resistant MR CNS in the homes of persons having contact with a hospital environment indicates that such inhabitants pose a risk of intrafamilial spreading of MR strains via air.

The respiratory tract of CF patients displays a sticky viscous mucus, which allows for the entrapment of airborne bacteria and fungal spores and provides a suitable environment for growth of microorganisms, including numerous yeast and filamentous fungal species. As a consequence, respiratory infections are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in this clinical context. Although bacteria remain the most common agents of these infections, fungal respiratory infections have emerged as an important cause of disease. Therefore, the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) has launched a working group on Fungal respiratory infections in Cystic Fibrosis (Fri-CF) in October 2006, which was subsequently approved by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM). Meetings of this working group, comprising both clinicians and mycologists involved in the follow-up of CF patients, as well as basic scientists interested in the fungal species involved, provided the opportunity to initiate collaborative works aimed to improve our knowledge on these infections to assist clinicians in patient management. The current review highlights the outcomes of some of these collaborative works in clinical surveillance, pathogenesis and treatment, giving special emphasis to standardization of culture procedures, improvement of species identification methods including the development of nonculture-based diagnostic methods, microbiome studies and identification of new biological markers, and the description of genotyping studies aiming to differentiate transient carriage and chronic colonization of the airways.

Many species of green bottle flies have been studied with regard to their importance in forensic examinations or clinical therapies, but the bacterial communities associated with this group of flies have not been comprehensively investigated. In this research, 454 pyrosequencing was used to reveal the bacterial communities in green bottle flies collected in different seasons. Meanwhile, the bacteria were screened with selective media and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Samples collected in three different seasons harbored distinctive bacterial communities. The predominant genera associated with green bottles flies were Staphylococcus in spring, Ignatzschineria in summer, and Vagococcus, Dysgonomonas, and an unclassified Acetobacteraceae in autumn. An upward trend in bacterial community diversity was observed from spring to autumn. Changes in climatic conditions could be the cause of these seasonal variations in fly-associated bacterial communities. The species of isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria also differed across seasons, but it was difficult to correlate seasonal changes in antibiotic-resistant bacteria with changes in whole communities. A number of multiple-antibiotic-resistant bacteria were isolated, and some of these strains were closely affiliated with pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, which could cause serious threats to public health. Overall, this research provided us with information about the composition and seasonality of bacterial communities in green bottle flies, and highlighted the risks of fly-mediated dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens."

MATERIALS/METHODS: We performed a multicentre, internal-crossover study comparing bacterial contamination levels in washrooms with hand-drying by either paper towels (PT) or jet air dryer (JAD, Dyson). 120 sampling sessions occurred over 12 weeks in each of 3 hospitals (UK/France/Italy). Bacteria were cultured from air, multiple surfaces and dust. Washroom footfall (patients/visitors/staff) was monitored externally. RESULTS: Footfall was nine times higher in UK washrooms. Bacterial contamination was lower in PT vs JAD washrooms; contamination was similar in France/UK, but markedly lower in Italy washrooms. Total bacterial recovery was significantly greater from JAD versus PT dispenser surfaces at all sites (median 100-300vs0-10 CFU; all p<0.0001). In UK/France, significantly more bacteria were recovered from JAD washroom floors (median 24vs191 CFU, p<0.00001). UK MSSA recovery was 3x more frequent and 6-fold higher for JADs vs PTs surfaces (both p<0.0001). UK MRSA recovery was 3x more frequent (21vs7 CFU) from JAD versus PT surfaces or floors.

We developed a streamlined protocol in line with the German state-of-the-art impingement sampling guideline. Following isokinetic sampling, a fast and reliable pretreatment methodology involving a series of cascade filtration steps was implemented, which produced fractions for spectrometric measurement devoid of interfering substances. We sampled the exhaust air from eight pig fattening farms around western Germany, which yielded two sets of samples for both method development and validation. For method development, in total 65 bacterial isolates were produced directly from the exhaust air samples, taxonomically classified by 16S rRNA-Gene sequencing, and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. In this way, we could assign fingerprint biomarkers to classified bacterial genera or even species to build up a preliminary reference database. For verification of the novel methodology and application of the reference database, we subjected the second set of exhaust air samples to the developed protocol. Here, 18 out of 21 bacterial species deposited in the database were successfully retrieved, including organisms classified in risk group 2, which might be used to evaluate the pathogenic potential of sampled exhaust air. Overall, this study pursues an entirely new approach to rapidly analyze airborne microbial fractions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH."

METHODS: The patients with keratitis were examined by lamp microscope; the direct smears of corneal scrapings were stained using 10% potassium hydroxide and Giemsa's staining and the results were observed under microscope. After hypha was found, the samples from corneal were taken for fungal culture and fungal susceptibility test in vitro according to the National Community of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS) document M38-A at the same time. Ketoconazole, Amphotericin B and Fluconazole eye drops were applied into eyes frequently and alternately. The affectivity of the treatment were also observed. The isolates of Alternaria alternata from patients were used to induce keratitis in rabbits. The rabbits were sacrificed by air after 5 days and 14 days and their corneas were taken for pathology and inoculating for fungi. RESULTS: All the patients have only one eye with Alternaria alternata's keratitis and their average age was 50 years old. The lesions of corneal necrosis in the patients and Alternaria alternata's keratitis in the rabbits were appeared as light grey, shallow and a diffused edge. Alternaria alternata showed as thick transparent hypha and a great of spherical chlamydospores on the top of hypha or cluster one and the other in corneal scraping under microscope. The hypha and spores of Alternaria alternata in the culture medium were all brown and the spores were separated into cells like wall brick and grew on the top of spores linking like chains. Anti-microbial susceptibility testing in vitro showed that Alternaria alternata was susceptible to Voriconazole, Amphotericin B, Ketoconazole, Miconazole, Econazole, Terbinafine and Fluconazole but it was resistant to Clotrimazole, Flucytosine ang Itraconazole. 22 of the patients were cured by dropping Amphotericin B, Ketoconazole and Fluconazole frequently and alternately but surgery was performed in one case. The mean cured time was 34 day. The lesion of rabbits keratitis caused by Alternaria alternata was thin and localized only in the region of lacking epicytes. The isolate from the rabbit's keratitis model was Alternaria alternata. CONCLUSIONS: The keratitis caused by Alternaria alternata has its distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics. The virulence of Alternaria alternata is relatively low to cornea and the combination of anti-fungal agents could cure Alternaria alternata keratitis."

The real understanding of hospital infection followed upon the discoveries of Pasteur, Koch and Lister and the beginning of the `Bacteriological Era'. The close of the 19th century saw the triumphs of hospital reform and asepsis and seemed to herald the final victory over hospital cross-infection. However, the victory was short-lived. It was soon realised that infections occurred not only in obstetric and surgical patients, but in medical patients as well, and that air could also be a source of infection. Streptococcal, staphylococcal and then Gram-negative bacilli as a cause of hospital infection became a focus of attention, as did antibiotic-resistant organisms.

Although originally thought to be an extracellular bacterium, numerous studies have demonstrated that GAS can trigger internalization into nonimmune cells to escape from immune surveillance or antibiotic-mediated killing. Epithelial cells possess a defense mechanism involving autophagy-mediated targeting and killing of GAS within lysosome-fused autophagosomes. In endothelial cells, in contrast, we previously showed that autophagy is not sufficient for GAS killing. In the present study, we showed higher galectin-3 (Gal-3) expression and lower Gal-8 expression in endothelial cells than in epithelial cells. The recruitment of Gal-3 to GAS is higher and the recruitment of Gal-8 to GAS is lower in endothelial cells than in epithelial cells. We further showed that Gal-3 promotes GAS replication and diminishes the recruitment of Gal-8 and ubiquitin, the latter of which is a critical protein for autophagy sequestration. After knockdown of Gal-3 in endothelial cells, the colocalization of Gal-8, parkin, and ubiquitin-decorated GAS is significantly increased, as is the interaction of Gal-8 and parkin, an E3 ligase. Furthermore, inhibition of Gal-8 in epithelial cells attenuates recruitment of parkin; both Gal-8 and parkin contribute to ubiquitin recruitment and GAS elimination. Animal studies confirmed that Gal-3-knockout mice develop less-severe skin damage and that GAS replication can be detected only in the air pouch and not in organs and endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that Gal-3 inhibits ubiquitin recruitment by blocking Gal-8 and parkin recruitment, resulting in GAS replication in endothelial cells.IMPORTANCE In epithelial cells, GAS can be efficiently killed within the lysosome-fused autophaosome compartment. However, we previously showed that, in spite of LC-3 recruitment, the autophagic machinery is not sufficient for GAS killing in endothelial cells. In this report, we provide the first evidence that Gal-3, highly expressed in endothelial cells, blocks the tagging of ubiquitin to GAS by inhibiting recruitment of Gal-8 and parkin, leading to an enhancement of GAS replication. We also provide the first demonstration that Gal-8 can interact with parkin, the critical E3 ligase, for resistance to intracellular bacteria by facilitating the decoration of bacteria with ubiquitin chains. Our findings reveal that differential levels of Gal-3 and Gal-8 expression and recruitment to GAS between epithelial cells and endothelial cells may contribute to the different outcomes of GAS elimination or survival and growth of GAS in these two types of cells."

The drug incorporates into the DPPTE layers during their formation increasing the area per molecule and causing the fluidization of the layers. The interactions of DNR with preformed layers depend on the membrane organization and therefore the dominating type of the driving forces. For less organized layers both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions take place, while for more condensed layers precompressed to higher surface pressures, electrostatic interactions seem to be prevailing. The drug adsorbs at the layer formed at the air-water interface, which prevents from its further penetration. The DPPTE layers were transferred onto gold electrodes by means of Langmuir-Blodgett and self-assembly method. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed that DNR is more easily incorporated into LB layers supported on solid substrate than into SAMs, since the former tend to be less compact and hydrophobic interactions between the acyl chains of the thiolipid and hydrophobic anthraquinone part of DNR is facilitated. The influence of pH changes of the supporting electrolyte on the electrode processes of DNR incorporated into the layers was also investigated in order to verify if the lipid environment affects the mechanism of electron transfer.

Although the lung receives the highest exposure to Hg-0 vapor, it is resistant to Hg-0 toxicity relative to the kidney and brain. In an earlier study, exposure of rats to 4 mg Hg-0 vapor/m(3), 2 h per day for 10 days, did not produce pathological alterations in the lung but increased metallothionein and glutathione S-transferase in the kidney. This study was undertaken to examine pulmonary gene expression associated with Hg-0 vapor inhalation. Total RNA was extracted from lung tissues of rats, previously exposed to air or Hg-0 vapor, and subjected to microarray analysis. Hg-0 vapor exposure increased the expression of genes encoding inflammatory responses, such as chemokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), TNF-receptor-1, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7, prostaglandin E2 receptor, and heat-shock proteins. As adaptive responses, glutathione S-transferases (GST-pi, mGST1), metallothionein, and thioredoxin peroxidase were all increased in response to Hg exposure. Some transporters, such as multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), P-glycoprotein, and zinc transporter ZnT1, were also increased in an attempt to reduce pulmonary Hg load. The expression of transcription factor c-jun/AP-1 and PI3-kinases was suppressed, while the expression of protein kinase-C was increased. Expression of epidermal fatty acid-binding protein was also enhanced. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed the microarray results. In summary, genomic analysis revealed an array of gene alterations in response to Hg-0 vapor exposure, which could be important for the development of pulmonary adaptation to Hg during Hg-0 vapor inhalation."

Such an approach would facilitate the prevention and mitigation of these threats. 'One Health' is defined as any added value in terms of the health of humans and animals, financial savings or environmental services achievable through the cooperation of human and veterinary medicines when compared to the two disciplines working separately. This principle also applies to the involvement of other disciplines from the natural sciences and humanities. This paper is not an exhaustive survey of integrated approaches but discusses concepts and methods and provides key examples of the benefits of a 'One Health' approach when applied to biological threats. Zoonoses and vector-borne diseases (i.e. diseases transmitted between animals and humans and by insect or acarian vectors) remain central biological threats in highly dynamic social and environmental conditions. Such diseases are not always directly transmitted. Contaminated food, water, air and soil represent important sources of transmission for foodborne and environmentally related diseases. Therefore, this paper treats environmental sanitation separately because of the importance of the excreta management of humans and animals. Integrated syndromic surveillance and antimicrobial resistance surveillance link the above aspects and are showcases for a 'One Health' approach to biological threat reduction. Biological threats are not only related to natural conditions but may also be exacerbated by large development projects such as dams, mining and infrastructure. Consequently, it is recommended that the health impact assessment (HIA) approach be implemented as early as the planning stage of any large infrastructure project located in a complex socioecological system. This paper extends the HIA approach to an integrated 'One Health' impact assessment approach."

Goals: The goals of the presented Study were to investigate the effects of preoperative bile duct stenting oil intraoperative bile duct cultures and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. Background: In pancreatic surgery, bile duct stenting is often aimed at improving postoperative outcome. As implantation of xenograft material in the main bile duct facilitates bacterial contamination and cholangitis, a critical evaluation of stenting is mandatory. Study: In all patients with a hepaticojejunostomy (n = 80), a bile duct Culture was collected during the operation. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis perioperatively and a retrograde flushing of bile ducts with warm saline after bile duct resection. Fifty-one percent (41/80) patients had biliary drainage before surgery, whereas 49\% (39/80) were operated without preoperative draining procedures. Results: After bile duct stenting, 98\% of patients had a positive bile culture, whereas only 21\% of infected bile was seen in patients Without drainage (P < 0.001). Despite infected bile, only 2\% stented patients developed acute cholangitis postoperatively, versus 13\% patients in the group without Stent (P = 0.231).

Conclusions: Preoperative biliary drainage leads to air almost 100\% bacterial contamination of bile ducts.

The quantities of ARGs and intl1 decreased in all microcosms, but thermophilic anaerobic digestion, alkaline stabilization, and pasteurization led to the most extensive decay of ARGs and intl1, often to levels similar to that of the control microcosms to which no wastewater solids had been applied. In contrast, the rates by which ARGs and intl1 declined using the other treatment technologies were generally similar, typically varying by less than 2 fold.

However, scarce information is available regarding trends in its epidemiology and etiology, or regarding its associated prognostic factors. The purpose of this work was to review available data on the burden of ARI among children under five years of age in Morocco. Methods: A systematic review was conducted for the period 1997-2014 using the PRISMA proposed methodology. Various online databases were screened, in addition to physical libraries of Moroccan medical schools, and official reports of the Moroccan Ministry of Health. Search queries in English and French languages included: Respiratory Tract Infections, pneumonia, epidemiology, etiology, microbiology, mortality and Morocco. The documents were included for analysis when they reported original data on the incidence, distribution, or a clinical description of the diseases or their etiology or described clinical management or national preventive strategies. Results: Thirty-two documents were included in the final analysis. 21 of which had been published. In 2012, ARI caused 13\% of paediatric deaths, half of the consultations at health facilities and third of the paediatric admissions. The microorganisms more frequently identified among hospitalized children were Streptococcus pneumoniae (38\%) and Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) (15\%). The MOH introduced Hib vaccines into the national immunization program (PNI) in 2007and the 13-valent vaccine against pneumococcus in 2010. The national first line antibiotics recommended for non-severe ambulatory treatment is Amoxicillin. Studies of antibiotic resistance showed from 1998 to 2008 a 22\% increase in the rate of penicillin non-susceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. Viral respiratory infections and the role attributed to air pollution in the incidence of ARI have been poorly characterized. Conclusions: Further efforts should be made towards the development of adequate surveillance programs to better clarify the epidemiology, etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the effectiveness of the preventives and curatives strategies in place against paediatric ARIs in Morocco. Additionally, a holistical approach should be used to identify the heath determinants of ARIs among children."

The present study, conducted between 1993 and 2003 in children with AML, sought to assess the frequency and characteristics of infectious complications (ICs), the incidence of VGS sepsis, the interest of preventive decontamination, and a possible cytarabine dose-effect on the occurrence of ICs. METHODS: Medical charts of 78 children treated according to the EORTC 58921 clinical trial were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were isolated in laminar air flow rooms, received non-absorbable gut decontamination, gum decontamination with vancomycin mouthwash, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole. ICs were categorized as microbiologically documented infections (MDI), clinically documented infections (CDI), or fever of unknown origin (FUO). RESULTS: Overall, 268 ICs occurred: 57.5% FUO, 8.5% CDI, and 34% MDI. Bloodstream infections occurred in 58 febrile episodes: Gram-positive bacteria represented 83% of the pathogens including 66.1% Staphylococcus species and 8.5% Streptococcus species (6.8% VGS), Gram-negative bacteria represented 13.5% of the pathogens and yeasts 3.5%. Five patients died of infection (6.4%). None died from bacterial infection and no case of VGS sepsis required intensive care. Invasive fungal infection was proven in four patients. Number of ICs was significantly different according to gum and gut decontamination status, and according to the cytarabine dose during the first intensification. No resistant strains were detected in spite of the use of local antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The low rate of VGS and enterobacteriaceae sepsis was probably due to the effective decontamination. Our supportive care strategy could potentially help enhance overall survival in children with AML."

Thymus caramanicus is an endemic species grown in Iran. Variation in the quantity and quality of the essential oil of wild population of T. caramanicus at different phenological stages including vegetative, floral budding, flowering and seed set are reported. The oils of air-dried samples were obtained by hydrodistillation. The yields of oils (w/w%) at different stages were in the order of: flowering (2.5%), floral budding (2.1%), seed set (2.0%) and vegetative (1.9%). The oils were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. In total 37, 37, 29 and 35 components were identified and quantified in vegetative, floral budding, full flowering and seed set, representing 99.3, 98.6, 99.2 and 97.8% of the oil, respectively. Carvacrol was the major compound in all samples. The ranges of major constituents were as follow: carvacrol (58.9-68.9%), p-cymene (3.0-8.9%), gamma-terpinene (4.3-8.0%), thymol (2.4-6.0%) and borneol (2.3-4.0%). Antibacterial activity of the oils and their main compounds were tested against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by disc diffusion method and determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. The inhibition zones (IZ) and MIC values for bacterial strains, which were sensitive to the essential oil of T. caramanicus, were in the range of 15-36mm and 0.5-15.0mg/ml, respectively. The oils of various phenological stages showed high activity against all tested bacteria, of which Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Thus, they represent an inexpensive source of natural antibacterial substances that exhibited potential for use in pathogenic systems."

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae followed a similar path some 20 years later. Recently however, metallo-beta-lactamases have originated in Asia. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 was found in almost every continent within a year of its emergence in India. Metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes are encoded on highly transmissible plasmids that spread rapidly between bacteria, rather than relying on clonal proliferation. Global air travel may have helped facilitate rapid dissemination. As the antibiotic pipeline offers little in the short term, our most important tools against the spread of antibiotic resistant organisms are intensified infection control, surveillance, and antimicrobial stewardship."

When Pasteurella multocida was administered as pathogenic agent to immunocompetent mice, 60\% of the animals exhibited clinical symptoms of pneumonia 2 to 4 days after bacterial contamination of the lungs. Two beta-lactam antibiotics were evaluated: amoxicillin and cefquinome, a fourth generation cephalosporin developed for food animals. First, a pharmacokinetic study was performed in infected mice to determine the exposure to amoxicillin or cefquinome required to treat clinically affected animals, based on the targeted values of PK/PD indices for beta-lactams. We then confirmed that these doses resulted in a 100\% clinical cure rate in animals exhibiting clinical signs of infection and harboring a high pathogenic inoculum. More interestingly, we also showed that the same 100\% clinical cure could be obtained in our model with 10-fold lower doses in animals at pre-patent stages of infection i.e. when harboring a low pathogenic inoculum. At the group level, antimicrobial drug consumption was reduced by treating animals at an early stage of the infection course with a pre-patent tailored dose. These results suggest that early treatment with a dose suitably adjusted to the stage of infection might help to reduce both overall antibiotic consumption and resistance selection pressure in the animals and in the environment."

Treatment of multi and extensively drug resistant TB requires use of second line drugs which are less efficacious, expensive and very toxic. This has necessitated a need to search for new treatment regimens especially from medicinal plants. Zanthoxylum leprieurii, a plant species from Rutace is used locally in the treatment of tuberculosis in Uganda. The aim of the study was to isolate, identify and characterize bio active compounds from Z. leprieurii stem bark with antimycobacterial activity. Methods: Crude extracts, fractions and compounds from air dried stem bark of Z. leprieurii were tested against pan sensitive (H37rv), isoniazid resistant (TMC 301) and rifampicin resistant (TMC 331) strains of M. tuberculosis using micro plate alamar blue assay. Isolation of active compounds was done by using column chromatography and thin layer chromatography. They were analysed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. Results: The methanol extract had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 47.5, 75.3 and 125.0 mu g/ml on the pan sensitive strain, rifampicin resistant and isozianid resistant strains of M. tuberculosis respectively. The chloroform extract had MIC values of 260 mu g/ml agnaist the pan sensitive strain and 156 mu g/ml on the rifampicin resistant strain. Of the sixteen fractions from the methanol extract, fraction Za(4) (MIC = 6.3 mu g/mL, 23.0 mu g/mL, 11.7 mu g/mL) and Za(6) (MIC = 11.7 mu g/mL 31.2 mu g/ml, 31.2 mu g/ml) were the most active. Three acridone alkaloids; hydroxy-1, 3-dimethoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (1), 1 hydroxy 3 methoxy 10 methyl 9 acridone (2) and 3 hydroxy 1, 5, 6 trimethoxy 9 acridone (3) were isolated from Za(4) and Za(6). The MIC of compound 3 was found to be 5.1 mu g/ml, 4.5 mu g/ml and 3.9 mu g/ml on H37rv, TMC 331 and TMC 301 while that of 1 was found to be 1.5 mu g/ml, 8.3 mu g/ml and 3.5 mu g/ml respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that Z. leprieurii is active on resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and could be a potential source of new leads against resistant tuberculosis.

Methods: Alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. At 15min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4- nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. The proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. The treated gel was tested against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and C. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units {[}CFU]/mL), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. Results: Non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) CFU/mL and within 15sec of treatment. The treated gel inactivated 10(9) CFU/mL of the organisms within 1min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. The plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. Dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. Scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure.

Nosocomial infection or colonisation of MRSA occurred in eight out of 140 consecutive patients who had no evidence of MRSA at admission. Antibiograms of 30 antibiotics revealed that the isolates from the eight patients were of the same strain as those from the surface of dental operatory. After treating the patients under a revised infection control (IC) protocol including a single use of barrier covers, MRSA was not detected on the surfaces of the dental operatory, and no nosocomial infection or colonisation occurred during hospitalisation (0/117 patients).

The compositions of bioaerosol were determined on blood trypticase soy agar and Haemophilus selective agar. Isolated strains were identified using API NH strips and apiweb software. The antibiotic resistance of H influenzae strains was determined by the disk diffusion method. Results: Compared with the proposed criteria for microbiologic quality of indoor air, the rooms were characterized by the very high bacterial contamination of the air. The prevailing component of bacterial aerosol was gram-positive cocci. Airborne H influenzae strains were found in 25\% of the investigated rooms and were mostly classified as biotype II (33\%). Conclusion: It may be accepted that the exposure to airborne H influenzae is typical of child day care centers in contrast to indoor environments with older population. Child day care center contribute to the expansion of H influenzae in human population via air.

The environment plays a central role in the transmission of hospital-acquired pathogens (HAP) and in the pathogenesis of HAI. Many bacteria, especially multidrug resistant ones, can survive for several months in the hospital environment in particular in areas close to the patients. It has been proven that pathogens are transmitted from the environment to the patients. Many studies have concluded that current cleaning methods are microbiologically ineffective. This failure concerns daily cleaning as well as terminal cleaning after patient discharge. It has been demonstrated that improvements in environmental cleaning are associated with a decrease in the rate of HAP and of HAI. New cleaning methods could enhance hospital cleaning efficiency. Three new technologies seem promising because they are microbiologically effective, easy and safe to use: (1) hydrogen peroxide vapor and (2) UV light decontamination are used for terminal cleaning. These techniques are effective even in difficultly accessible areas. (3) ultramicrofibers which can be associated with a copper-based biocide can be used for daily cleaning. Other methods such as ozone, steam or high-efficiency particulate air filtration are not efficient enough to be considered serious contenders for the improvement of the quality of the hospital environment. These new technologies have not been yet linked to a decrease in the prevalence and the incidence in HAP and HAI. It remains difficult to justify the extra-cost associated with these new methods until more studies can confirm their effectiveness in the management of HAI.  2011 Bentham Science Publishers."

However, little is known about the levels of triazole susceptibility in outdoor airborne fungi making it difficult to assess the risks of inhalation exposure to airborne, antifungal-resistant fungi. This study examined triazole susceptibilities of the airborne thermotolerant fungi isolated from the ambient air of the Seoul Capital Area of South Korea. We used impactor air sampling with triazole-containing nutrient agar plates as the collection substrates to screen for airborne fungal isolates based on their triazole susceptibilities. This study estimated that 0.17\% of all the culturable fungi belong to the pathogenic thermotolerant taxa, among which each isolate of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mu g/mL or greater for itraconazole. Their concentration in air was 0.4 CFU/m(3). Seven human pathogenic Paecilomyces variotii isolates had MICs of 32 mu g/mL or greater and lower than 2 mu g/mL for the agricultural fungicide tebuconazole and the medical triazole itraconazole, respectively. Though the concentration was low, our results confirm the presence of airborne fungi with high MICs for itraconazole in ambient air. Inhalation is an important exposure route because people inhale more than 10 m(3) of air each day. Vigilance is preferred over monitoring for the emergence of triazole-resistant fungal pathogens in ambient outdoor air."

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antibacterial agents to control this pathogen. Bacteriophages are a potential alternative treatment for MRSA infections. Objectives: The objective of this study was the isolation and characterization of MRSA phages from the sewage at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Methods: Two MRSA strains were isolated from patient blood. The isolated strains were confirmed as MRSA through the conventional methods. Phages were then isolated from the sewage at the tertiary pediatric hospital. Lytic activity was determined with a spot test, while the titers of phage lysates were measured using the DLA technique. The morphology was assessed using electron microscopy, and the latent period time and burst size were determined. Results: Electron microscopy showed MRSA phages' resemblance to members of the family Siphoviridae, serogroups A and F. They exhibited a latent period of 70 minutes and a relatively burst size of 2,400 plaque-forming units (PFU)/infected cell. The titer of the phages was determined to be 3 x 10(9) PFU/mL using the by DLA technique. Conclusions: In this study, two phages from the family Siphoviridae were isolated and characterized from sewage at a tertiary pediatric hospital; these phages specifically target MRSA. Their presence may be one reason for the transfer of antibiotic resistance or virulence factors, resulting in transduction and the conversion of nonvirulent strains of Staphylococcus to virulent strains. Considering that phages through can be transferred to wards in an air-born manner, it is better to create negative pressure in the sewage pipes at hospitals until the phages can no longer transfer to the wards via aerosols."

However, inhalation of stable air might represent another route of transmission. We, therefore, quantified presence of bla(CTX-M) group 1 genes (CTX-Mgrl) in dust and the association with CTX-M-grl carriage in pig farmers, family members and employees. We included 131 people living and/or working on 32 conventional Dutch pig production farms (farmers, family members and employees) during two sampling moments over a 12 -month interval. Human stool samples, rectal swabs from 60 pigs per farm, and 2-5 dust samples collected using an electrostatic dust collector (EDC) (as a proxy for presence of viable CTX-M-grl carrying bacteria in air) were obtained per farm. Presence of ESBLproducing Escherichia Coli (E. colt) in stool samples and rectal swabs was determined by selective plating and CTX-M-grl was identified by PCR. Dust samples were analyzed directly by PCR for presence of CTX-M-grl. Questionnaires were used to collect information on nature, intensity and duration of animal contact. Overall human prevalence of CIX-M-grl carriage was 3.6\%. CTX-M-grl was detected in dust on 26\% of the farms and in pigs on 35\% of the farms, on at least one sampling moment. Human CTX-M-grl carriage and presence of CIX-M-grl in dust were associated univariately (OR=12.4, 95\% CI=2.7-57.1). In multivariate analysis human CTX-M-grl carriage was associated with the number of working hours per week (OR=1.03, 95\% CI=1.00-1.06), presence of CTX-M-grl carrying pigs on the farm (OR=7.4, 95\% CI=1.1-49.7) and presence of CTX-M-grl in dust (OR=3.5, 95\% CI=0.6-20.9).

Although early diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance developing. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of archived samples. METHODS: Virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. RESULTS: Resistance to rifampicin was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64 mug/ml (n = 2) and 16 mug/ml (n = 1). All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125 mug/ml, which was the limit of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values ranging between 0.25 and 2 mug/ml for neomycin and 0.125-1 mug/ml for erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance.

In the present study, we explored the expression and antibacterial activity of MK in an airway context. MK was detected in bronchial epithelial cells of large airways and type 2 pneumocytes of normal lungs by immunohistochemistry. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed a surface-associated distribution, both on the ciliated apical and basolateral sides, and MK was detected in sputum obtained from healthy individuals by ELISA. In vitro, MK killed the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae at below micromolar concentrations, an activity retained in the presence of sodium chloride at physiological concentrations. The MK molecule consists of two domains with three anti-parallel beta-sheets and a COOH-terminal tail. Although both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains alone showed antibacterial activity, the COOH-terminal domain including the tail region possessed higher bactericidal activity, i.e. in the order of the holoprotein. Retinoic acid-induced differentiation of primary bronchial epithelial cells, using an air-liquid interface system, revealed bactericidal activity in the apical airway surface liquid, an activity that was reduced after immunoprecipitation of MK. This study shows that airway epithelial cells of large airways and alveoli have a constitutive production of MK that is part of the bactericidal activity present in the air surface liquid, at least in vitro, and may thus be an important part of this arm of airway host defense."

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against H. influenzae clinical isolates showing different pattern of resistance in comparison with azithromycin and clarithromycin at 1/4 x, 1/2 x, 1 x, 2 x, 4 x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and to peak concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF). The secondary aim was to determine the influence of CO2 enriched atmosphere on bacterial susceptibility. RESULTS: Telithromycin showed high activity against H. influenzae, including strains susceptible to beta-lactams (n = 200), beta-lactamase producer (n = 50) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant (BLNAR) (n = 10), with MIC from < or =0.03 to 4 mg/L, and MIC50/MIC90 of 1/2 mg/L with susceptibility rate of 100%, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) from 2 to 4-fold higher than the MIC. Azithromycin was the most active tested macrolide (range: 0.25 - 4 mg/L; MIC50/MIC90: 1/2 mg/L), comparable to telithromycin, while clarithromycin showed the highest MICs and MBCs (range: 0.25 - 8 mg/L; MIC50/MIC90: 2/8 mg/L). In time-kill studies, telithromycin showed a bactericidal activity at the higher concentrations (4 - 2 x MIC and ELF) against all the strains, being complete after 12 - 24 hours from drug exposition. At MIC concentrations, at ambient air, bactericidal activity of telithromycin and azithromycin was quite similar at 12 hours, and better than that of clarithromycin. Besides, telithromycin and clarithromycin at ELF concentrations were bactericidal after 12 hours of incubation for most strains, while 24 hours were needed to azithromycin to be bactericidal. Incubation in CO2 significantly influenced the MICs and MBCs, and only slightly the in vitro killing curves. CONCLUSION: Telithromycin showed an in-vitro potency against H. influenzae comparable to azithromycin, with an in-vitro killing rate more rapid and superior to clarithromycin at 2X-MIC against beta-lactamase producers and BLNAR strains, and to azithromycin at ELF concentrations against beta-lactamase negative strains. Against all strains, MICs and MBCs were lower in the absence of CO2 for the tested antibiotics, showing an adverse effect of incubation in a CO2 environment. The in-vitro potency together with the tissue concentrations of the antimicrobial, should be considered in predicting efficacy."

However, as the number of studies of gene regulation, architecture, and pathogenic traits of C. albicans biofilms has increased, so have differences in results. This suggests that depending upon the conditions employed, biofilms may vary widely, thus hampering attempts at a uniform description. Gene expression studies suggest that this may be the case. To explore this hypothesis further, we compared the architectures and traits of biofilms formed in RPMI 1640 and Spider media at 37 degrees C in air. Biofilms formed by a/alpha cells in the two media differed to various degrees in cellular architecture, matrix deposition, penetrability by leukocytes, fluconazole susceptibility, and the facilitation of mating. Similar comparisons of a/a cells in the two media, however, were made difficult given that in air, although a/a cells form traditional biofilms in RPMI medium, they form polylayers composed primarily of yeast cells in Spider medium. These polylayers lack an upper hyphal/matrix region, are readily penetrated by leukocytes, are highly fluconazole susceptible, and do not facilitate mating. If, however, air is replaced with 20\% CO2, a/a cells make a biofilm in Spider medium similar architecturally to that of a/alpha cells, which facilitates mating. A second, more cursory comparison is made between the disparate cellular architectures of a/a biofilms formed in air in RPMI and Lee's media. The results demonstrate that C. albicans forms very different types of biofilms depending upon the composition of the medium, level of CO2 in the atmosphere, and configuration of the MTL locus."

Biofilms were grown in different experimental settings, and plasmid transfer was monitored using laser scanning confocal microscopy and plate counting. In closed flow cells, plasmid transfer in surface-attached submerged biofilms was negligible. In contrast, a high plasmid transfer efficiency was observed in a biofilm floating at the air-liquid interface in an open flow cell with low flow rates. A vertical flow cell and a batch culture biofilm reactor were then used to detect plasmid transfer at different depths away from the air-liquid interface. Extensive plasmid transfer occurred only in a narrow zone near that interface. The much lower transfer frequencies in the lower zones coincided with rapidly decreasing oxygen concentrations. However, when an E. coli csrA mutant was used as the recipient, a thick biofilm was obtained at all depths, and plasmid transfer occurred at similar frequencies throughout. These results and data from separate aerobic and anaerobic matings suggest that oxygen can affect IncP-1 plasmid transfer efficiency, not only directly but also indirectly, through influencing population densities and therefore colocalization of donors and recipients. In conclusion, the air-liquid interface can be a hot spot for plasmid-mediated gene transfer due to high densities of juxtaposed donor and recipient cells.  2011, American Society for Microbiology."

MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Two immunocompetent patients who had handled cats developed unilateral upper-extremity adenitis associated with a distal papular lesion and fever. The adenitis and distal lesions persisted and progressively worsened. Cultures of the involved lymph nodes from both patients grew R. henselae, a recently described organism associated with bacillary angiomatosis and peliosis hepatis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and with bacteremia in immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. The organism was characterized as oxidase negative and X-factor dependent and had a characteristic pattern in analysis of whole-cell fatty acids differing from Afipia felis, a bacterium that has been associated with cat scratch disease. The identity of the isolate was confirmed by analysis of whole-cell fatty acids using gas chromatography and by amplification of the citrate synthetase gene sequence and analysis of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified product. The organisms were broadly susceptible to a variety of antimicrobials by broth microdilution; however in-vitro resistance to first-generation cephalosporins correlated with clinical failure of therapy. CONCLUSION: Rochalimaea henselae can be a cause of cat scratch disease in immunocompetent patients."

Older, immunocompromised or catheterised patients are at higher risk of infection than immunocompetent patients without indwelling devices and, when comparing infection rates, patients should be stratified to compare like with like. Hospital-acquired infections are generally present in 8-10\% of patients at any one time and to limit the spread of infection, strict admission and isolation policies should be enforced when considering a potentially infectious patient. The mode of transfer of their particular disease should also be considered (ie. airborne, contact etc.).

A good maintenance of MWF re-circulation systems can extend the lifetime of coolants and ensure the quality of the tools produced. In MWFs, as in the other water-based environments, microorganisms usually live in the form of biofilms, the communities of bacteria and fungi attached to the surface of sumps, metal parts and also to each other. Biofilms exhibit very high resistance to biocides. The effect of biocides that are used as additives to MWFs to control the growth of the bacterial and fungal microbiomes (microorganisms characteristic to the individual coolant system) have become the subject of research only in recent years. There are also only sparse reports on the impact of biocides on microorganisms growing in biofilms in MWF installations. Fast growing mycobacteria are important members of these biofilm communities. Their presence has recently been linked with the occurrence of cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a serious respiratory disorder in the metal industry employees. The new, relatively fast and inexpensive techniques to assess the species diversity within MWF microbiomes and their population size should be developed in order to control the microorganisms' proliferation in MWFs and to diminish the occupational exposure to harmful bioaerosols in metal industry."

A 10(5)-fold amplification was observed both by colony count and total cell count gaining 4x10(7) cfu/cells per gram eggshell within 30 hr of incubation. Furthermore, the bacterial community present on eggshells was analyzed by generation of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and identification of eight isolates. RFLP analysis revealed no shift in community composition during incubation and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus gallinarum were found as the predominant species on turkey eggshells, both have been classified as risk group 2 microorganisms (German TRBA 466). Since Enterococcus spp. were found as predominant species on turkey eggshells, contribution of this genus to bioaerosol formation was demonstrated. During different work activities with poult and eggshell handling concentrations of airborne enterococci up to 1.3x10(4) cfu m(-3) were detected. In contrast, no enterococci were identified at a day without poult or eggshell processing. In conclusion, turkey hatching eggs carry a viable specific microflora from breeder flocks to hatcheries. After hatching of turkey poults, hatcher incubators and eggshell fragments provide appropriate conditions for excessive bacterial growth. Thus, high bacterial loads on eggshell fragments are a source of potential harmful bioaersols caused by air flows, poult activity, and handling of equipment."

The purpose of this study was to understand the distribution pattern of bioaerosols during an annual trade fair in the historical city of Gwalior, central India, a very important historical fair that was started by the King of Gwalior Maharaja Madho Rao in 1905. METHODS: Air samples were collected from six different sites at the fair ground and three different sites in a residential area before/during/after the fair using an impactor sampler on microbial content test agar and rose bengal agar for total bacteria and fungi, respectively. The representative strains of bacteria and fungi were further identified and selected bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing according to US Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The bacterial bioaerosol count [colony-forming units (CFU)/m(3)] at fair sites was found to be 9.0 x 10(3), 4.0 x 10(4), and 1.0 x 10(4) before the start of the fair, during the fair, and after the fair, respectively. The fungal bioaerosol count at fair sites was 2.6 x 10(3) CFU/m(3), 6.3 x 10(3) CFU/m(3), and 1.7 x 10(3) CFU/m(3) before the fair, during the fair, and after the fair, respectively. Bacterial/fungal bioaerosols during-fair were increased significantly from the bacterial/fungal bioaerosols of the before-fair period (p < 0.05); they were also significantly higher than the bacterial/fungal bioaerosols at non-fair sites during the event (p < 0.0001). The proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria over the fair ground was significantly increased during-fair and was still higher in the after-fair period. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) were also reported at the fair ground. CONCLUSION: The study indicates significantly higher bacterial and fungal bioaerosols during the fair event. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the health aspects and guidelines to control microbial load during such types of events."

Forty samples (6.2\%) tested positive for L. monocytogenes, confirmed by both bacteriological and molecular methods. Among the food categories surveyed, the highest prevalence was observed in raw meat samples at 16.0\% (15/94), followed by 9.9\% (10/101) in quick-frozen food samples and 73\% (4/55) in cooked meat samples. Serotyping showed that majority of the isolates (67.5\%) belonged to serotype 1/2a, followed by 1/2b (22.5\%),112c (7.5\%) and 3c (2.5\%). Isolates were assessed for their ability to form biofilms. Significant differences in biofilm forming abilities were observed between storage temperatures and serotypes. Anti-biofilm efficacy of industrial disinfectants, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was examined by measuring minimal effective concentration (MEC) on L. monocytogenes in biofilm. A positive correlation was observed among the biofilm's resistance to H2O2 and the biomass of biofilms. ClO2 was found to be more effective against biofilm and inactivated all the listerial cells in the biofilm state, whereas H2O2 was not able to kill all the cells in biofilms at the recommended concentrations according to National Food Safety Standard of China. Our study suggests that there is potential public health risk of L. monocytogenes infection in Shanghai. Efficacy against L. monocytogenes biofilm should be considered when evaluating disinfectants.

When these two modalities are combined, the net reduction in infections is about 75%. Oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, however, are poorly tolerated, costly, and frequently associated with the acquisition of resistant gram-negative rods when used outside the laminar air flow room setting. The concept of colonization resistance may be the new approach needed for microbial suppression of the nonisolated patient. If the anaerobic flora is undisturbed, newly acquired organisms generally cannot colonize the patient. Agents such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole suppress many of the potentially pathogenic aerobic bacteria but not the anaerobes, leaving colonization resistance relatively intact. The result thus far has been a reduction in infection without a concurrent increase in colonization or infection by organisms resistant to the antimicrobial agents commonly used for therapy."

The results revealed that imprudent prescribing of antibiotics in ambulatory care was influenced by clinical factors, physician-patient interactions, health care organization factors, type of health insurance coverage, and policy factors. A simple, single-intervention, in the form of printed educational materials, medication audits, or performance feedback, generally resulted in small changes in prescribing behaviors. Multi-faceted interventions involving physicians, patients, and community education programs consistently produced moderate changes in prescribing behaviors. Delayed prescribing was an effective intervention with a low associated cost to reduce antibiotic use for viral respiratory tract infections. Efforts to reduce the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics should target the high-prescribing physicians and apply multi-faceted interventions involving a combination of healthcare providers with consumer education, medication audits, and performance feedback, supplemented by educational outreach from pharmaceutical representatives."

Overall, respondents had a poor knowledge of the three types of IPs, especially droplet precautions (13 correct answers, 11.7\%) and airborne IP (17 correct answers, 16.3\%). We observed a statistically significant difference between attending physicians and residents for the type of IP to prescribe to a patient presenting with multidrug-resistant urinary infection: 44 residents (86\%) gave the correct answer vs 42 attending physicians (70\%), P = 0.04. Physicians (both residents and attending physicians) who were already familiar with the dedicated webpage available on the hospital's intranet (n = 40) obtained a score of 4.75/10 (+/- 2.0) compared with 4.03/10 (+/- 1.7) for those who had never used that tool (n = 71). The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04). The average score for both residents and attending physicians was 4.3/10 (+/- 1.9, range: 1-10). Attending physicians' and residents' scores were 4/10 (+/- 1.8) and 4.5/10 (+/- 1.9), respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.14). Conclusion. - Physicians' knowledge of IPs was insufficient. Improvement in medical training is needed. The use of a dedicated webpage on hospitals' intranet could help physicians acquire better knowledge on that matter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."

These types of infections in severely immunocompromised patients have a common feature: a poor clinical response to antifungal therapy. Infection is usually airborne, although local infections in cases of skin trauma are also possible. These fungi are resistant to some common antifungal agents; therefore, surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue, when possible, should be combined with specific systemic antifungal treatment in immunocompromised patients. In the absence of randomized clinical trials, most experience in the treatment of these infections is with amphotericin B. Experience with new antifungal agents is still limited, and recovery from neutropenia remains the main predictor of a favorable outcome."

The multidrug resistance is increasing in Asia and Eastern Europe. For the moment, the phenomena is rare in France (involving 1,1% of tuberculosis cases with 4% of MDR tested XDR). The best preventive measure consists in a proper use of antituberculosis drugs with combined therapy including at least 3 active drugs during the first 2 months. Another challenge is to be aware of the possibility of resistance and to prevent further transmission to other patients by airborne isolation measures, particularly in immunosuppressed patients."

Heat flow power (HFP)-time curves of the growth metabolism of S. dysenteriae affected by berberine were determined using the thermal activity monitor (TAM) air isothermal microcalorimeter, ampoule mode, at 37 A degrees C. By analyzing these curves and some quantitative parameters using multivariate analytical methods, similarity analysis (SA) and principal component analysis (PCA), the antibacterial activity of berberine on S. dysenteriae could be accurately evaluated from the change of the two main parameters, the maximum heat flow power P (m) (2) and total heat output Q (t): berberine at low concentration (25 mu g mL(-1)) began to inhibit the growth of S. dysenteriae, high concentrations (50-200 mu g mL(-1)) of berberine had strong antibacterial activity on S. dysenteriae, when the concentration of berberine was higher (250-300 mu g mL(-1)), this antibacterial activity was stronger. All these illustrated that the antibacterial activity of berberine on S. dysenteriae was enhanced with the increase of the concentration of this compound. Berberine can be used as potential novel antibacterial agent for treating multidrug-resistant Shigella. This work provided a useful idea of the combination of microcalorimetry and multivariate analysis for studying the activity of other compounds or drugs on organisms."

Design, Setting, and Participants.-Retrospective review of surveillance data from all cases of cholera reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1994, in the United States and its territories. Main Outcome Measures.-Clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory surveillance data. Results.-From 1992 through 1994, 160 cases of cholera were reported to CDC by 20 states and 1 territory. This is a marked increase: only 136 cases were reported from 1965 through 1991. Outbreaks affecting 75 passengers on an airplane from Latin America and 5 passengers on a cruise ship in Southeast Asia accounted for 50\% of cases. Vibrio cholerae O139 caused 6 cases (4\%). The proportion of V cholerae O1 isolates resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent rose from 3\% in 1992 to 93\% in 1994. Of 158 patients whose location of exposure was known, 151 (96\%) acquired infection abroad (125 in Latin America, 26 in Asia). Of 105 persons whose reason for travel was known, 31 (30\%) were US residents who had returned to their country of origin to visit family or friends, and 65 (62\%) were non-US residents visiting the United States from cholera-affected countries. The cholera rate among persons arriving in the United States from cholera-affected regions was 0.27 case per 100 000 air travelers, not substantially increased from earlier estimates. Conclusions.-Cholera has increased in the United States since 1991, reflecting global changes in cholera epidemiology, and is now primarily travel associated and antimicrobial resistant. Most travelers were not traditional tourists; reaching them with prevention measures may be difficult. The risk of cholera to the individual traveler remains extremely low."

Filter mating was performed on nonselective agar plates with high-density inocula. A more realistic setup was created by performing modified atmosphere experiments on cooked ham using high-density and low-density inocula. Plasmid transfer was observed between 10 and 37 degrees C, with plasmid transfer also observed at 7 degrees C during a prolonged incubation period. When high-density inocula were used, transconjugants were detected, both on agar plates and cooked ham, under the three atmospheres (air, 50\% CO2-50\% N-2, and 100\% N-2) at 7 degrees C. This yielded a median transfer ratio (number of transconjugants/number of recipients) with an order of magnitude of 10(-4) to 10(-6). With low-density inocula, transfer was only detected under the 100\% N-2 atmosphere after 10-day incubation at 7 degrees C,-yielding a transfer ratio of 10(-5). Under this condition, the highest bacterial density was obtained. The results indicate that low temperature and modified atmosphere packaging, two important hurdles in the food industry, do not necessarily prevent plasmid transfer from Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei to Listeria monocytogenes."

Administrative policies, engineering controls and personal respiratory protection were assessed by observations and interviews at the clinics. RESULTS: Of 51 clinics, 11(22\%) had infection control policies, 13 (26\%) triaged coughing patients and 16 (31\%) had a dedicated nurse and a dedicated consulting room for treating tuberculosis (TB) patients. Study clinics treated a median of 99 patients (range 3-331) daily and a median of 15 TB patients (range 2-73) monthly. Of the rooms in the clinics, all of which rely on natural ventilation, half (149/284) had <= 5.12 air changes per hour. Eleven (22\%) of 51 clinics had N95 masks available for staff use.

This study elucidates the tendency of pig farms with a significantly higher antimicrobial use to remain in clusters in certain geographical regions of Denmark. Animal Daily Doses/100 pigs/day were calculated for all three age groups of pigs (weaners, finishers and sows) for each quarter during 2012-13 in 6,143 commercial indoor pig producing farms. The data were split into four time periods of six months. Repeated spatial cluster analyses were performed to identify persistent clusters, i.e. areas included in a significant cluster throughout all four time periods. Antimicrobials prescribed for weaners did not result in any persistent clusters. In contrast, antimicrobial use in finishers clustered persistently in two areas (157 farms), while those issued for sows clustered in one area (51 farms). A multivariate analysis including data on antimicrobial use for weaners, finishers and sows as three separate outcomes resulted in three persistent clusters (551 farms). Compared to farms outside the clusters during this period, weaners, finishers and sows on farms within these clusters had 19\%, 104\% and 4\% higher use of antimicrobials, respectively. Production type, farm type and farm size seemed to have some bearing on the clustering effect. Adding these factors as categorical covariates one at a time in the multivariate analysis reduced the persistent clusters by 24.3\%, 30.5\% and 34.1\%, respectively."

This serious challenge in microbiology was addressed in the present study. We examined whether P. jirovecii could be cultured in a permanent three-dimensional air-liquid interface culture system formed by CuFi-8 cells, a differentiated pseudostratified airway epithelial cell line. Cultured pseudostratified cells were inoculated with bronchoalveolar fluid that had been confirmed to be positive for P. jirovecii using PCR. Five days later, the cells and basal medium were harvested and tested for P. jirovecii using quantitative PCR (qPCR), commercially available immunofluorescence detection assays, and Grocott staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded thin sections of infected-cell cultures. We successfully productively cultivated and propagated P. jirovecii from these P. jirovecii-positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. Furthermore, we provide evidence that P. jirovecii induced cytopathic effects on lung epithelial cells and was even invasive in cell culture. To the best of our knowledge, the cell culture system developed herein represents the first methodology to enable molecular analyses of this pathogen's life cycle and further in vitro studies of P. jirovecii, such as assessments of drug sensitivity and resistance as well as investigations of the pathogen's stability against environmental factors and disinfectants. IMPORTANCE This is the first report of the successful productive cultivation and propagation of Pneumocystis jirovecii, a human-pathogenic fungus of major clinical significance. These findings are groundbreaking because they will influence the field of diagnostic microbiology, facilitate the testing of antibiotics against P. jirovecii, and enable stability studies of this pathogen when exposed to the environmental factors and chemicals that hospitals are required to use for disinfection. Because productively culturing P. jirovecii has been attempted unsuccessfully for several decades, this study represents a breakthrough in this field."

Some of the world problems and present trends in management","British Journal of Diseases of the Chest","54","1","?","10.1016/S0007-0971(60)80041-1","Probably the only reports on record showing approximately a 100 per cent. reversal of infectiousness are those resulting from a daily SM-high INH combination. A possible exception is two series of cases reported by Crofton (1958) and by Ross et al. (1958). Other methods of initial therapy in tuberculosis have consisted of various combinations of streptomycin, isoniazid, PAS, viomycin, cycloserine and pyrazinamide-all used in conventional doses. Results vary, but all report therapeutic failures ranging from 3 to 10 per cent. or more. When this is projected over the number of admissions throughout all the hospitals in a particular country the figure becomes high indeed; so that even a failure of 1 or 2 per cent. need not be accepted, if these can otherwise be avoided. We are now faced with a percentage of drug resistant tuberculous infections, and unless a more effective regimen in initial treatment is used more universally, then therapeutic failures are bound to continue to increase. Thoracic surgery on such cases has been shown to result in a higher incidence of complications and post-operative deaths. From the medical standpoint, newer antimicrobials have given hope to some but have proved disappointing to many. Thus there is a definite need for other good anti-tuberculous agents in the class of streptomycin and isoniazid. Dublin in 1941 forecast a substantial elimination of tuberculosis by 1960 for the majority of the population of the United States. Rich wrote thus in 1944: ""The disease that still kills more than twice as many individuals as any other single cause of death during this particularly productive and enjoyable period of life (15 to 44 years) can hardly be jubilantly regarded as nearly conquered."" In a sense these thoughts expressed by Rich are applicable even today. Great strides have been taken in the treatment of tuberculosis and mortality figures have been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, considered on a world-wide basis tuberculosis remains a formidable problem. Less fortunate countries have hardly started on the road to progress. Adequate control in most western countries alone is only a partial solution to this problem. Air travel has greatly reduced distances, and more people each year use this mode of transport, so that opportunity for infection persists. For the many countries that have much to achieve in tuberculosis control, a rapid development of better hospital facilities is essential. Adequate chemotherapy in hospital, as outlined in the preceding paragraphs, with or without surgery, would ensure a much better use of a limited number of beds, as sputum conversion has been shown to be consistent and rapid in almost all cases. Once in a non-infectious state most patients could then be managed on a domiciliary basis, thus considerably increasing patient turnover. It is highly desirable to maintain adequate chemotherapy even in home treatment, and under prevailing curcumstances the second best choice would be the use of daily INH with PAS, remembering the better results obtained with dual drug therapy compared to the use of a single drug. In this instance high dosage INH (with pyridoxine) with PAS would ensure a smaller number of treatment failures; though the problem of toxicity has to be borne in mind. The use of intermittent streptomycin with another drug, or that of INH alone, would at best give a false sense of security. Success would be scored in a number of cases, but therapeutic failures would be many. Compulsory yearly X-ray examination for the adult population (as in the case of Australia), and compulsory hospitalisation of the recalcitrant patient, are steps in the right direction. The question of BCG vaccination in certain groups needs to be established. BCG has been extensively used in Europe, S. America, India and other countries, and reports of benefits therefrom are many; but it has not been highly favoured in the United States. All these factors, together with a more intensive case-finding programme and a more adequate therapeutic approach, have to be considered before a successful control of tuberculosis can be accomplished. In the writer's opinion an ideal set-up for tuberculosis treatment is that seen in England: a country-wide distribution of chest clinics with corresponding chest units either in a sanatorium or, as is the present trend, in a general hospital, provides an excellent and totally free service with regard to case-finding, hospitalisation, and treatment, as well as subsequent out-patient follow-up care.  1960 Baillire, Tindall & Cox, Ltd."

These resistance genes may be carried on motile genetic elements, or transposons, capable of interspecies and intergeneric transmission among bacterial strains colonizing a same ecological niche. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the resistance profile of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains producing beta-lactamases in periodontal pockets. Methods: Fifty strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans were isolated from 42 patients with adult periodontitis. No patient had periodontal or antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months. Bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets greater than or equal to 5 mm, appropriately diluted, inoculated onto selective medium (chocolate blood agar with bacitracin 75 mu g/ml and vancomycin 5 mu m/ml) and incubated for 5 days at 37 degrees C in air with 5\% CO2. After conventional identification, susceptibility testing to 11 antibiotics was performed by the broth dilution method, in trypticase soy broth supplemented with yeast extract, hemin, and 0.1\% NaHCO3 to maintain microaerophilic conditions in the microtitration plate wells by CO2 formation. Results: No strain demonstrated resistance to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination, pristinamycin, or ciprofloxacin at the breakpoint, but 40\% of the strains were slightly resistant to penicillin G, and 4\% were resistant to erythromycin, 90\% to spiramycin, 18\% to clarythromycin, 4\% to tetracycline, 72\% to metronidazole, and 12\% to ornidazole. Amoxicillin, followed by tetracycline and erythromycin, was the most effective antibiotic on A. actinomycetemcomitans. The phenotypic research of a beta-lactamase was negative for all the strains tested. Conclusions: In this work, most A. actinomycetemcomitans strains were resistant to metronidazole, but the amoxicillin-metronidazole association may be of interest against subgingival anaerobic and capnophilic mixed flora. Pristinamycin and ciprofloxacin appeared as effective alternative monotherapies against A. actinomycetemcomitans. The threat of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance related to B-lactamase production is currently not a problem with A. actinomycetemcomitans as it has been reported in oral anaerobes."

Much of risk analysis addresses basic descriptive information: how big is a risk now, how is it changing over time or with age, how does it differ for people or situations with different characteristics, on what factors does it depend, with what other risks or characteristics does it cluster? Such questions arise not only for public and occupational health and safety risks, but also for risks of failures or degraded performance in engineering infrastructure or technological systems, financial systems, political systems, or other systems of systems (Guo and Haimes 2016). Simply knowing how large a risk is now and whether it is increasing, staying steady, or decreasing may be enough to decide whether a proposed costly intervention to reduce it is worth considering further. This chapter shows how to use basic tools of descriptive analytics, especially interaction plots (showing the conditional expected value of one variable at different levels of one or more other variables), together with more advanced methods from Chap. 2, such as regression trees, partial dependence plots, Bayesian networks (BNs), to describe risks and how they vary with other factors. A brief discussion and motivation of these methods is given for readers who have skipped Chap. 2. Chapter 4 introduces additional descriptive techniques, including plots that use non-parametric regression to pass smooth curves or surfaces through data clouds. It shows how they can be used, together with simple mathematical analysis, to resolve a puzzle that has occasioned some debate among toxicologists: that some studies have concluded that workers form disproportionately high levels of benzene metabolites at very low occupational exposure concentrations compared to higher concentrations, while other studies conclude that metabolism of benzene at low concentrations is approximately linear, and proportional to concentrations in inhaled air. Chapter 5 emphasizes the value of descriptive plots, upper-bounding analyses, and qualitative assumptions, as well as more quantitative risk assessment modeling, in bounding the size of human health risks from use of antibiotics in food animals. Chapter 6 calculates plausible bounds on the sizes of the quantitative risks to human health of infection with a drug-resistant super-bug from swine farming operations. Together, these chapters illustrate how descriptive analytics can be used to obtain and present useful quantitative characterizations of human health risks despite realistic scientific uncertainties about the details of relevant causal processes.

Although more rigorous infection control measures are being implemented, it is clear that the current modalities to reduce nosocomial infections are not sufficient. Textiles are an excellent substrate for bacterial growth under appropriate moisture and temperature conditions. Patients shed bacteria and contaminate their pyjamas and sheets. The temperature and humidity between the patients and the bed are appropriate conditions allowing for effective bacterial. proliferation. Several studies have found that personnel in contact with contaminated textiles were the source of transmission of the micro-organisms to susceptible patients. Furthermore, it has been reported that bed making in hospitals releases large quantities of micro-organisms into the air, which contaminate the immediate and non-immediate surroundings. Contaminated textiles in hospitals can thus be an important source of microbes contributing to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. We hypothesize that the use of antimicrobial textiles, especially in those textiles that are in close contact with the patients, may significantly reduce bioburden in clinical settings and consequently reduce the risk of nosocomial infections. These textiles should possess broad spectrum biocidal properties. They should be safe for use and highly effective against antibiotic resistant micro-organisms, including those that are commonly involved in hospital-acquired infections, and they should not permit the development of resistant micro-organisms to the active compound.

Daptomycin is a novel cyclic-lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces roseosporus that has progressed as a significant anti-MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) antibiotic. But, the economic practicality of this highly valued secondary metabolite is deterred by its poor production and tedious processing methodology. The present study aims at strategic improvement of Daptomycin production through morphological variations of S. roseosporus cells. Free cells, pelletized cells and immobilized cells on ultra porous refractory brick and silk sachets were investigated for the production of Daptomycin in a lab-scale 2.0 l air-lift bioreactor. The effect(s) of nitrogen source, inoculum size and oxygen stress were analyzed for pellet formation of S. roseosporus. Interestingly, free cells produced 750 mg/l of Daptomycin in a single batch. But, the three phase broth viscosity increased due to vigorous growth of free cells which hampered the oxygen transfer rate. The cell degeneration over the time deterred pellet reusability. 1430 mg/l Daptomycin was produced using pellets for 2 batches. On the contrary, mechanical stability, buoyancy and reusability of refractory bricks and silk sachets were beneficial. Daptomycin production was recorded for 6-8 batches. Immobilized cells on refractory bricks and silk sachets led to 4895 mg/l and 3623 mg/l Daptomycin production respectively.

Therefore, whole-cell immobilization could contribute to the ameliorated production of this life-saving drug."

Therefore, vancomycin is used in patients allergic to cephalosporins, when a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus or enterococci infections is reported, or when the patient has recently received broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. The antibiotic doses must take into account the haemodilution due to extracorporeal circulation and the necessity to obtain sufficient serum concentrations throughout surgery.

The hospital environment is a source of medically important pathogens that are mostly multidrug resistant (MDR) and posing a major therapeutic challenge. The aim of this study was to assess the surface and air bacteriology of selected wards at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out from 15th February to 30th April 2017. A total of 356 surface and air samples were collected from selected wards using 5% sheep blood agar (Oxoid, UK) and processed at FHRH microbiology laboratory following the standard bacteriological procedures. Pure isolates were tested against the recommended antibiotics using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods, and the susceptibility profile was determined based on Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23 for Windows. Results. Of the total 356 samples processed, 274 were from surfaces and 82 were from air. Among these, 141 (39.6%) showed bacterial growth, yielding a total of 190 isolates. Gram-positive isolates were predominant at 81.6% (n=155), while the gram negatives were at 18.4% (n=35). The main isolates were coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNs), 44%, followed by S. aureus, 37.4%, and Klebsiella species at 11.6%. The bacterial load on surfaces and air was found beyond the standard limits. Besides, the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolates showed that about 75% of the identified isolates were found resistant for two and more antimicrobial agents tested. Conclusions. This study showed high degree of bacterial load that is beyond the standard limits on both surfaces and air samples of the hospital. Furthermore, some 75% of the isolates were found multidrug resistant. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and strengthen the infection prevention practice of the hospital. Moreover, stakeholders should also reinforce actions to decrease the pressure of antimicrobial resistance in the studied area.  2018 Hailu Getachew et al."

The Gibbs free energy, Delta G, and the compressibility modulus (C-S(-1)), obtained from the surface pressure isotherms, indicated changes in the in-plane interactions of CPZ/DPPG mixed monolayers, with positive values of Delta G. The arrangement of CPZ in the zwitterionic DPPC monolayers causes a weaker interaction in CPZ/ DPPC mixed monolayers, with the Delta G fluctuating around zero. IR measurements in transferred monolayers showed that CPZ did not affect the conformational order of the acyl chains, its effects being limited to the bands corresponding to the headgroups. Furthermore, since no shift was observed for the acyl chain bands, the phase transition induced by CPZ is not a liquid expanded (LE) to liquid condensed (LC) transition, as the latter is associated with chain ordering. Taken together, the IR and compressibility results demonstrate that the effect from CPZ cannot be correlated with temperature changes in the subphase for pure monolayers, in contrast to models proposed by other authors."

Roman physicians suggested to consumptives better nutrition, sea voyages and change of air, while, during the Middle Ages, `royal touch' were considered as an effective remedy for scrofula. In the following centuries, phthisis was cured using old herbal preparations and new chemical compounds, mainly aimed at soothing symptoms; in addition, harmful approaches (for example, bleeding and purging) were commonly accepted, according to medical theories of that time. In the second part of the nineteenth century, the discovery of the contagious nature of consumption (Villemin, Koch) addressed physicians and scientists toward often-unsuccessful remedies, such as antiparasitic treatment, immunomodulants, vaccination and serum therapy. In that period only sanatorium regimen-based on aerotherapy, bed rest, better nutrition, sunbathing and moderate physical exercise-appeared to provide first partial successes. In these structures, more invasive approaches were also employed, such as lung collapse surgical interventions (for example, phrenicotomy, thoracoplasty) and artificial pneumothorax. Since the second part of the twentieth century, the industrialization of pharmacotherapy, the development of antimicrobial chemotherapy and the introduction of new antibiotics (streptomycin, isoniazid, para-aminosalicylic acid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) deeply revolutionized treatment for tuberculosis, allowing to achieve important successes. In this same period, the figure of Piero Sensi (1920-2013) deserves to be recalled for his contribution in the development of rifampicin that played a decisive role in the chemical fight against the white plague. Nowadays, antibiotic resistance is an emerging problem, representing a new challenge for physicians and scientists who sometimes re-proposed old `historical' approaches."

Reviews of the applications of photocatalysis in disinfection (Gamage and Zhang 2010; Chong et al., Wat Res 44(10):2997-3027, 2010) and of modelling of TiO(2) action have recently been published (Dalrymple et al. , Appl Catal B 98(1-2):27-38, 2010). In this review, we give an overview of the effects of photoactivated TiO(2) on microorganisms. The activity has been shown to be capable of killing a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous and unicellular fungi, algae, protozoa, mammalian viruses and bacteriophage. Resting stages, particularly bacterial endospores, fungal spores and protozoan cysts, are generally more resistant than the vegetative forms, possibly due to the increased cell wall thickness. The killing mechanism involves degradation of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane due to the production of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. This initially leads to leakage of cellular contents then cell lysis and may be followed by complete mineralisation of the organism. Killing is most efficient when there is close contact between the organisms and the TiO(2) catalyst. The killing activity is enhanced by the presence of other antimicrobial agents such as Cu and Ag."

Pathogenic microbes are transmissible from the air, skin, hands and other interpersonal contacts and cause diseases most of the time. This study centres on the microbial assessment of telephone receivers, their ability to transfer bacterial infections and the isolation of these microorganisms from receivers, with an emphasis on Staphylococcus aureus and its antibiotic susceptibility pattern. 1,591 isolates were obtained from roadside telephone booths in 16 different locations in the Lagos metropolis. They were all characterised using the Cowan and Steel's manual, after which the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the most frequently-occurring isolate was determined. Results: Of all the locations, Oshodi was found to have the largest number of microorganisms, with Akoka having the least. The organisms were Providencia, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Proteus, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Micrococcus and yeast. Staphylococcus spp. was the most frequently occurring, making up 20.2 percent of the total number of isolated organisms, followed by Bacillus (18 percent), while Enterobacter and Citrobacter were the least common. 44 percent of the total Staphylococcus screened for an antimicrobial susceptibility pattern showed high resistance to most of the antibiotics used. Conclusion: This result could be related to the emergence of Staphylococcus-resistant strains, especially in a highly-populated area where there are health and hygiene problems and where drugs are abused. Precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of infectious diseases through the use of public telephones."

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of garenoxacin in adults with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis undergoing a pre-treatment diagnostic sinus aspirate. Methods: This Phase II, multicenter, noncomparative, open-label study was conducted at 30 centers in the United States, Mexico, Argentina, and Europe. Male and female patients aged 18 to 80 years with clinical signs and symptoms lasting 5 but  28 days and radiologic signs (air-fluid level, opacification, mucosal thickening) of acute maxillary sinusitis were eligible. The entry criteria for the 5-day treatment regimen did not include mucosal thickening of 5 mm because it was believed that improvement in mucosal thickening might not be reliably measurable at the 5-day time point. All patients received garenoxacin 400 mg QD for 5 or 10 days. Maxillary sinus needle aspiration for Gram stain, routine culture, and susceptibility testing were performed before treatment, and, if clinically indicated, during and after treatment. Bacteriologic eradication (negative culture on repeat sinus aspiration) and cure rates (complete resolution of all signs and symptoms) were assessed at a test-of-cure visit 5 to 18 days after the end of treatment. The occurrence of adverse events was recorded by the investigators up to 30 days after the last administration of garenoxacin by questioning patients. Results: A total of 546 patients were enrolled and 543 were randomized (5-day cohort: mean age, 40 years; mean weight, 76 kg; 56% women; 10-day cohort: mean age, 41 years; mean weight, 77 kg; 58% women).

Bacteriologic eradication rates in microbiologically evaluable patients were 94% in both cohorts (5 days, 204/217; 10 days, 182/193). Eradication rates in the 5- and 10-day cohorts were as follows: S pneumoniae, 94% (62/66) and 93% (39/42); H influenzae, 100% (30/30) and 93% (26/28); S aureus, 96% (23/24) and 91% (31/34); and M catarrhalis, 89% (8/9) and 86% (12/14). Of the 9 patients with acute bacterial sinusitis due to multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae, 8 achieved clinical cure with garenoxacin treatment. Adverse events (AEs) most frequently reported were diarrhea (<2%), nausea (2%-6%), headache (2%-6%), and dizziness (<2%). Two percent of patients withdrew because of an AE (allergic reaction, adverse gastrointestinal effects, dyspnea, dizziness, headache, or elevation in liver enzymes).

Prevention of TB transmission in acute care facilities relies on prompt identification and implementation of airborne isolation, rapid diagnosis, and treatment of presumptive pulmonary TB patients. In areas with low TB burden, this strategy may result in inefficient utilization of airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs). We reviewed TB epidemiology and diagnostic approaches to inform optimal TB detection in low-burden settings. Published clinical prediction rules for individual studies have a sensitivity ranging from 81\% to 100\% and specificity ranging from 14\% to 63\% for detection of culture-positive pulmonary TB patients admitted to acute care facilities. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have a specificity of >98\%, and the sensitivity of NAATs varies by acid-fast bacilli sputum smear status (positive smear, >= 95\%; negative smear, 50\%-70\%). We propose an infection prevention strategy using a clinical prediction rule to identify patients who warrant diagnostic evaluation for TB in an AIIR with an NAAT. Future studies are needed to evaluate whether use of clinical prediction rules and NAATs results in optimized utilization of AIIRs and improved detection and treatment of presumptive pulmonary TB patients."

The derivatives self-assembled into the vesicular or rice-like nanostructures based on the hydrophobic interaction between lipid chains when injected into water, in accordance with the results of computer simulation.

Moreover, modern technology and medical treatment have the potential to provide new habitats and opportunities for microorganisms to propagate, spread and infect their victims. The quality of healthcare, hospital design and facility management and hospital hygiene can also influence the risk of infection transmission in hospitals. In the wake of such important issues, this chapter will first introduce bioaerosol-related infections in hospitals and explore different sources and pathways for transmission. Afterwards, we will review bioaerosol properties and deposition in human respiratory systems before discussing the chain of infection and infection control in hospitals. This information will assist the audience to understand the application of aerosol science and technology in infection control.

A membrane-inlet mass spectrometer was employed to monitor, in a closed system, O(2), CO(2), and H(2). When introduced into air-saturated buffer, S. vortens rapidly consumed O(2) at the average rate of 62 +/- 4 nmol/min/107 cells and CO(2) was produced at 75 +/- 11 nmol/min/107 cells.

Hydrogen production was inhibited by 62\% immediately after adding 150 mu M KCN to the reaction vessel, and by 50\% at 0.24 mu M CO, suggesting that an Fe-only hydrogenase is responsible for H(2) production. Metronidazole (1 mM) inhibited H(2) production by 50\%, while CO(2) production was not affected. This suggests that metronidazole may be reduced by an enzyme of the H(2) pathway, thus competing for electrons with H+."

In the context of the resistance of this organism to conventional antibiotics, an understanding of the regulation of natural endogenous antimicrobial molecules is of paramount importance. Previous studies have shown that both human and mouse airways express a variety of these molecules, including defensins, cathelicidins, and the four-disulfide core protein secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. We demonstrate here by culturing mouse tracheal epithelial cells at an air-liquid interface that, despite the production of Defb1, Defb14, and Defr1 in this system, these cells are unable to clear S. aureus when exposed to this respiratory pathogen. Using an adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene transfer strategy, we show that overexpression of elafin, an anti-elastase/antimicrobial molecule (also a member of the four-disulfide core protein family), dramatically improves the clearance of S. aureus. In addition, we also demonstrate that this overexpression is efficient in vivo and that intratracheal instillation of Ad-elafin significantly reduced the lung bacterial load and demonstrates concomitant anti-inflammatory activity by reducing neutrophil numbers and markers of lung inflammation, such as bronchoalveolar lavage levels of tumor necrosis factor and myeloperoxidase. These findings show that an increased antimicrobial activity phenotype is provided by the elafin molecule and have implications for its use in S. aureus-associated local and systemic infections."

The identified isolates including Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens biovar V, and P. pseudoalcaligenes ssp. citrulli were found to produce extracellular enzymes, respectively: protease and lecithinase production (100\%), and lipase activity (85.7, 42.9, 100, and 100\%, and nonlipolytic, respectively). The isolates did not produce slime and had no detectable beta-lactamase activity. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was tested using the disk diffusion method. Pseudomonas spp. had the highest resistance to penicillin G (100\%), then sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (28.1\%). However, all Pseudomonas spp. isolates were 100\% susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, and imipenem. Multidrug-resistance patterns were not observed among these isolates. In this study, Pseudomonas spp., exhibiting spoilage features, were isolated mainly from cheeses. Isolation of this organism from processed milk highlights the need to improve the hygienic practices.

Guinea pigs were continuously exposed for 4 months to the exhaust air of a 6-bed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis inpatient hospital ward in South Africa. Serial tuberculin skin test reactions were measured to determine infection. All animals were subsequently evaluated for histologic disease progression at necropsy. Although 75\% of the 362 exposed guinea pigs had positive skin test reactions {[}>= 6 mm], only 12\% had histopathologic evidence of active disease. Reversions (>= 6 mm change) in skin test reactivity were seen in 22\% of animals, exclusively among those with reactions of 6 -13 mm. Only two of 86 guinea pigs with reversion had histological evidence of disease compared to 47\% (31/66) of guinea pigs with large, non-reverting reactions. Immunosuppression of half the guinea pigs across all skin test categories did not significantly accelerate disease progression. In guinea pigs that reverted a skin test, a second positive reaction in 27 (33\%) of them strongly suggested re-infection due to ongoing exposure. These results show that a large majority of guinea pigs naturally exposed to human-source strains of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis became infected, but that many resolved their infection and a large majority failed to progress to detectable disease.

Recent studies in liver carcinoma cells and hepatocytes showed that MRP4 expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The AhR has particular importance in the lung and is most commonly associated with the up-regulation of cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism of benzo{[}a]pyrene (B{[}a]P) to reactive intermediates.

Despite lengthy multidrug antibiotic treatment, the presence of damaged parenchymal tissue leads to symptomatic disease recurrence, often with resistant organisms. The use of surgical resection as an adjunct to medical therapy may alter this cycle, although little is known about the use of thoracoscopic lung resection in this patient population. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of patients with pulmonary NTM disease from July 2004 to December 2009. All patients had focal bronchiectasis of the right middle lobe and lingula, treated with targeted antimicrobial therapy for several months prior to resection. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients underwent 172 operations, with 38 patients having staged bilateral resections. The cohort was predominately female (96%) and Caucasian (95%), with a mean age of 59 years (range 34-81 years). Using a thoracoscopic approach in all patients, 102 middle lobectomies and 70 lingulectomies were performed. Conversion to open thoracotomy occurred in five cases (3%). Secondary procedures were performed in 20 cases (12%). There was no operative mortality. Postoperative morbidity was noted following 12 operations (7%), primarily consisting of prolonged air leak. The mean length of stay was 3.3 days (range 1-15 days). CONCLUSIONS: Although medical therapy remains the primary treatment modality for patients with pulmonary NTM disease, the selective use of pulmonary resection may reduce the incidence of symptomatic disease recurrence. The addition of thoracoscopic resection to treatment regimens for patients with Lady Windermere syndrome can be accomplished with minimal morbidity and mortality."

Bioaerosol produced at low temperature as in harmonic scissors may contain live multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, viral DNA of HBV, HCV, HIV and HPV. It also contains live malignant cells and dead cellular materials. These produce an unquantified infection risk. The obnoxious smoke causes ocular and upper respiratory tract irritation, creates visual problems for surgeons. Surgical masks are not capable of filtering the produced bioaerosol. Removal of smoke from the site of operation by local exhaust ventilation is not complete. When produced in a closed cavity as in laparoscopic surgery the patient also suffers from carboxyhaemoglobinaemia and methaemoglobinaemia.

The incidence of tuberculosis has risen since 1990, and in some countries, the resistant forms are becoming more and more frequent. Surgical treatment is once again needed to manage these problems. The purpose of this study was to analyze the indications and results of resection, which we performed for pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods. From 1980 to 1997, 477 patients were operated on for thoracic or intrathoracic tuberculosis in Laennec Hospital, Paris (259 suffered lung diseases). There were 165 women and 94 men, aged 25 to 86 years (mean 46 years), from Europe (n = 148), North Africa (n = 65), Subsaharian Africa (n = 34), Asia (n = 7), and the West Indies (n = 5). This population was reviewed concerning the lung tuberculosis (sequelae or active lesions), the indications of lung resection, the type of resections performed, and the results at 1, 6, and 12 months. Results. Active lesions were present in 97 eases and sequelae in 162. Surgery was performed for a therapeutic purpose in 104 patients with sequelae, and in 10 patients with active tuberculosis (pneumonectomy, n = 19; pleuropneumonectomy, n = 19; lobectomy, n = 54; and segmentectomy, n = 22), Surgery was performed for a diagnostic purpose in 54 patients with sequelae, and in 87 patients with active lesions (lobectomy, n = 32; segmentectomy, n = 19; wedge resection, n = 94, of which 11 performed by video-assisted thoracoscopy since 1991). One patient died after pleuropneumonectomy. We observed 25 complications: empyema, n = 7;hemothorax, n = 2; prolonged air leaks, n = 14; and pneumopathy, n 2. All patients with active lesions subsequently were given antitubercular drugs. Follow-up was 100\% at 1 month, 57\% (n = 92) and 77\% (n = 75) at 6 months for patients with sequelae and for patients with active lesions, respectively. All were asymptomatic with a normal chest roentgenogram. The number of operations for active lesions is increasing over the years, while it is decreasing for sequelar lesions. Conclusions. In our department, surgery is being performed more frequently to make a diagnosis in cases of active tuberculosis, and to treat complicated lesions in case of sequelae. Lung resection for active tuberculosis evolving under treatment or for drug resistance was rare. However, our study confirms the good results commonly obtained by surgery and supports the idea that surgery may help eradicate tuberculosis when social and economic circumstances render its medical management difficult or hazardous.

DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old girl was brought to our hospital with fever and blood-tinged sputum 2 weeks prior to her admission. She suffered from neurologic sequelae of herpetic encephalitis and had been bed-ridden since 5 years of age. A longitudinal paraspinal soft mass had been noted in the previous week by her mother. She had been given oral feeding despite frequent choking for the past few years. On palpation, the mass can be squeezed to follow the least resistance of subcutaneous space longitudinally extending to the lower thoracic region. Chest computed tomography scan revealed right lower lobe necrotizing pneumonitis and a pleuro-cutaneous fistula leading to the subcutaneous air locules. A protracted course of antibiotics was prescribed and subcutaneous air trapping decreased in size over 8 weeks. COMMENTS: Eikenella corrodens has increasingly been implicated as a potential causative pathogen in pleuropulmonary infections. Pleuro-cutaneous fistula and abscess formation complicating empyema and necrotizing pneumonitis due to E. corrodens infection have not been reported. A bulging thoracic subcutaneous lesion waxes and wanes with respiration suggest the possibility of a pleruo-cutaneous fistula. Treatment of Eikenella empyema using antibiotics without surgical decortication requires a prolonged course of antibiotic therapy."

This ability arises primarily from the presence of a large plasmid pMOL30 which includes a cluster of 19 cop genes that respond to copper. One of the protein products CopK is induced at high levels and is expressed to the periplasm as a small soluble protein (8.3 kDa). Apo-CopK associates in solution to form a dimer (K(D) approximately 10(-5) M) whose structure was defined by NMR and X-ray crystallography. The individual molecules feature two antiparallel beta-sheets arranged in a sandwich-like structure and interact through C-terminal beta-strands. It binds Cu(II) with low affinity (K(D)(Cu(II)) > 10(-6) M) but Cu(I) with high affinity (K(D)(Cu(I)) = 2 x 10(-11) M). Cu(I)-CopK was also a dimer in the solid state and featured a distorted tetrahedral site Cu(I)(S-Met)(3)(NCS). The isothiocyanato ligand originated from the crystallization solution. Binding of Cu(I) or Ag(I), but not of Cu(II), favored the monomeric form in solution. While Ag(I)-CopK was stable as isolated, Cu(I)-CopK was moderately air-sensitive due to a strong binding cooperativity between Cu(I) and Cu(II). This was documented by determination of the Cu(I) and Cu(II) binding affinities in the presence of the other ion: K(D)(Cu(I)) = 2 x 10(-13) M and K(D)(Cu(II)) = 3 x 10(-12) M, that is, binding of Cu(II) increased the affinity for Cu(I) by a factor of approximately 10(2) and binding of Cu(I) increased the affinity for Cu(II) by a factor of at least 10(6). Stable forms of both Cu(I)Cu(II)-CopK and Ag(I)Cu(II)-CopK were isolated readily. Consistent with this unprecedented copper binding chemistry, NMR spectroscopy detected three distinct forms: apo-CopK, Cu(I)-CopK and Cu(I)Cu(II)-CopK that do not exchange on the NMR time scale. This information provides a valuable guide to the role of CopK in copper resistance."

The liquid-and air-permeable multifunctional nanofibrous membrane contains distributed fibers with two distinct characteristic sizes, proven to be unique physical origins of its exceptional sharp tensile strength and elongation percentage. Concerns over the unfavorable release of nanosilver into the environment and human respiratory systems were palliated by a unique approach for in situ formation of a chemical network that trapped the concerned entities. The nanomembrane not only could effectively filter the M. tuberculosis H37Ra bacteria, but could also completely exterminate them by a process involving cell membrane destabilization via direct contact of the inherently intact lipid-protein bilayers with the nanofibrous network with embedded lethal nanosilver. Finally, the persistent physical integrity of the membrane after harsh simulated weathering indicates its potential and extended usage as a nanofilter in remote areas where TB is endemic."

Synergy in reducing tuberculosis transmission may be attainable by combining interventions that shrink the reservoir of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (preventive therapy), shorten the time between disease onset and treatment initiation (case finding and diagnosis), and prevent transmission in key settings, such as the built environment (infection control). In evaluating efficacy and estimating population-level impact, cluster-randomized trials and mechanistic models play particularly prominent roles. Historical and contemporary evidence suggests that effective public health interventions can halt tuberculosis transmission, but an evidence-based approach based on knowledge of local epidemiology is necessary for success.

Although concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) have higher production efficiency and profitability with less resource consumption compared to the traditional family-based and ``free range{''} farming, they bring significant environmental pollution concerns and pose public health risks. Gaseous pollutants and bioaerosols are emitted directly from CAFOs, which have health implications on animal producers and neighboring communities. A range of pollutants are excreted with the animal waste, including nutrients, pathogens, natural and synthetic hormones, veterinary antimicrobials, and heavy metals, which can enter local farmland soils, surface water, and groundwater, during the storage and disposal of animal waste, and pose direct and indirect human health risks. The extensive use of antimicrobials in CAFOs also contributes to the global public health concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Efforts on treating the large volumes of manure generated in CAFOs should be enhanced (e.g., by biogas digesters and integrated farm systems) to minimize their impacts on the environment and human health. Furthermore, the use of veterinary drugs and feed additives in industrial livestock and poultry farming should be controlled, which will not only make the animal food products much safer to the consumers, but also render the manure more benign for treatment and disposal on farmlands. While improving the sustainability of animal farming, China also needs to promote healthy food consumption, which not only improves public health from avoiding high-meat diets, but also slows down the expansion of industrial animal farming, and thus reduces the associated environmental and public health risks."

Chickens were treated with D-CATH-2 in ovo at day 18 of embryonic development or intramuscularly at days 1 and 4 after hatch. At 7 days of age, birds were challenged intratracheally with avian pathogenic E. coli. Protection was evaluated by recording mortality, morbidity (Mean Lesion Score) and bacterial swabs of air sacs at 7 days post-infection. In ovo D-CATH-2 treatment significantly reduced morbidity (63\%) and respiratory bacterial load (>90\%), while intramuscular treatment was less effective. D-CATH-2 increased the percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes and heterophils by both administration routes. E. coli specific IgM levels were lower in in ovo treated animals compared to intramuscular D-CATH-2 treatment. In short, in ovo treatment with the Host Defense Peptide derived D-CATH-2 can partially protect chickens from E. coli infection, making this peptide an interesting starting point to develop alternatives to antibiotics for use in the poultry sector."

Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water-and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a `syndemic' with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent - from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming. However, global climate assessments assert that these are not sufficient to halt climate change patterns. The roles of regionally specific climate research, socioecologically sustainable industrialisation paths for developing countries, and adoption of health system strengthening strategies are therefore vital."

Identification of the isolated strains were mainly based on conventional methods. In vitro antibacterial susceptibilities of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamicin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, tigecycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, were evaluated by using the gradient (E-test, bioMerieux, France) strip method. The bacterial suspensions adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity was inoculated to Mueller Hinton agar plates, supplemented with 5% sheep blood, and E-test strips of selected antibacterial were applied. The plates were incubated in ambient air 48 hours at 37 masculineC and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 were used as quality control strains for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Minimum inhibitors concentration (MIC) values were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for slow-growing bacteria such as Haemophilus spp. Of the 106 Brucella spp. strains included in to the study, 90 were identified as Brucella melitensis, and 16 were Brucella abortus. MIC90 values of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamicin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, tigecycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined as 1 microg/ml, 0.25 microg/ml, 0.19 microg/ml, 0.25 microg/ml, 0.19 microg/ml, 0.75 microg/ml, 0.25 microg/ml, 0.75 microg/ml, 0.38 microg/ml, 0.64 microg/ml, and 0.19 microg/ml respectively. According to MIC90 values, gentamicin, moxifloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, were the most effective antibacterial agents. All the Brucella strains were sensitive to all the tested antibacterial agents except rifampicin. Only six isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to rifampicin. With regard to fluoroquinolones, the most active antibacterial agent was moxifloxacin, followed by ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. In our study, no resistance was found for the classically recommended antibacterial agents used in the treatment of Brucella species in our hospital but antibiotic susceptibility patterns of Brucella spp. may vary geographically. As a result it was concluded that, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Brucella species should be determined and controlled periodically to avoid the possible development of resistance problems in the future."

Aim of the study was to identify the main exposure predictors for the risk of conversion through evaluation of tuberculin screening results. Methods HCWs were investigated by a questionnaire (community, occupational, IC exposure risk factors) and tuberculin skin test screening. Results Conversion was detected in 5 (8\%) of the 63 exposed workers and was not associated with either community or previous work-related risk factors. According to risk assessment, tuberculin conversion was related to neither amount time of exposure, workshifts, nor number of contacts. Conversely, an exposure to the IC in different hospital rooms was found significantly different among converters compared to non-converters (chi(2), P = 0.004). In particular, conversion was associated with exposure in two (obstetric emergency room, ambulatory discharge) out of the nine contact environments. Tuberculin conversion rates were associated with the room cubations of the exposure environments (chi(2) stop for trend, P < 0.01) and with worker age.

Death rates from invasive aspergillosis remain high because of limited treatment options and increasing antifungal resistance. The aim of this study was to identify key fungal-specific genes participating in vitamin B biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. Because these genes are absent in humans they can serve as possible novel targets for antifungal drug development. Methods: By sequence homology we identified, deleted and analysed four key A. fumigatus genes (riboB, panA, pyroA, thiB) involved respectively in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and thiamine (vitamin B1). Results: Deletion of riboB, panA, pyroA or thiB resulted in respective vitamin auxotrophy. Lack of riboflavin and pantothenic acid biosynthesis perturbed many cellular processes including iron homeostasis. Virulence in murine pulmonary and systemic models of infection was severely attenuated following deletion of riboB and panA, strongly reduced after pyroA deletion and weakly attenuated after thiB deletion. Conclusions: This study reveals the biosynthetic pathways of the vitamins riboflavin and pantothenic acid as attractive targets for novel antifungal therapy. Moreover, the virulence studies with auxotrophic mutants serve to identify the availability of nutrients to pathogens in host niches."

Therefore, the discovery of antimicrobial stress factors that have strong inhibitory effects on bacterial biofilm formation would have great impact on the food, personal care, and medical industries. METHODS AND RESULTS: Salicylate-based poly(anhydride esters) (PAE) have previously been shown to inhibit biofilm formation, possibly by affecting surface attachment. Our research evaluated the effect of salicylate-based PAE on biofilm-forming Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. To remove factors associated with surface physical and chemical parameters, we utilized a strain that forms biofilms at the air-liquid interface. Surface properties can influence biofilm characteristics, so the lack of attachment to a solid surface eliminates those constraints. The results indicate that the salicylic acid-based polymers do interfere with biofilm formation, as a clear difference was seen between bacterial strains that form biofilms at the air-liquid interface (top-forming) and those that form at the surface-liquid interface (bottom-forming). CONCLUSION: These results lead to the conclusion that the polymers may not interfere with attachment; rather, the polymers likely affect another mechanism essential for biofilm formation in Salmonella. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Biofilm formation can be prevented through controlled release of nature-derived antimicrobials formulated into polymer systems."

The isolate grew in the presence of 20\% (w/v) NaCl, antibiotic production being maximum with 5\% (w/v) NaCl in the production medium. Natural seawater stimulated antibiotic biosynthesis. The absence of catabolite repression during the synthesis of the antimicrobial substance was demonstrated by the utilization of glucose by this isolate. The 16S rRNA gene of this aerobic, gram-positive, mycelium- and spore-forming microorganism was amplified, and molecular phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequence showed less than 93\% similarity with its closest relative, indicating differentiation at the genus level. The highly stable, active principle was purified by butyl acetate extraction and silica-gel chromatography and a single compound was found to posses the broad-spectrum activity. Molecular characterization showed that the active compound is a lipid. Bioreactor studies demonstrated that antibiotic production is strongly dependent on the scale of operation and there is a definite relation between the dissolved oxygen concentration, medium pH, glucose utilization, cell differentiation and antibiotic production. Maximum production in 30 h could be obtained by regulation of the medium pH in the alkaline range by a combination of controlled addition of NaOH, regulation of the air supply and changes in the reactor configuration. Considering all of the above evidences and based on comparison with the current literature, a novel antimicrobial appears to have been isolated."

A control air insufflated group (sham: n = 6), a cotton smoke insufflated group (smoke: n = 12), and a leukopenic cotton smoke insufflation group (smoked + depleted: n = 6) were compared.

Aims: Present work was carried out to assess the antimicrobial activity of crude methanolic extract of Cocculus hirsutus against some multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods: Different plant parts of C. hirsutus were collected and air dried and soxhlet extracted using methanol as solvent. These extracts were then tested for antimicrobial activity using agar-well diffusion method. Inhibition zone, activity index, minimum inhibitory concentration were also calculated. Statistical Analysis: Mean value and standard deviation were calculated for each test bacteria and fungus. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA and P values were considered significant at P < 0.05. Results: Maximum Zone of inhibition was observed in the callus extracts against Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.9  0.56 mm) amongst the bacteria species and against Phanerochaete chrysosporium (2.5  0.63 mm) amongst the fungal species. Methanolic extracts of leaf and stem showed varied activity with a different strain of bacteria and fungi. Methanolic extract of leaf and stem showed maximum inhibition zone against Micromonospora sp. bacterial strain. In this study, methanolic extract of callus sample showed highest promising minimal inhibitory concentration of 61.1 g/ml in S. epidermidis. Conclusion: Results of the present study reveal that methanolic extracts of C. hirsutus are showing great antimicrobial potential against tested microorganisms and may be exploited for future antimicrobial drugs."

Our previous study showed that a submicron textured polyurethane surface can inhibit staphylococcal bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. To further understand the effect of the geometry of textures on bacterial adhesion as well as the underlying mechanism, in this study, submicron and micron textured polyurethane surfaces featuring ordered arrays of pillars were fabricated and modified to have different wettabilities. All the textured surfaces were originally hydrophobic and showed significant reductions in Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A adhesion in phosphate buffered saline or 25\% platelet poor plasma solutions under shear, as compared to smooth surfaces. After being subjected to an air glow discharge plasma treatment, all polyurethane surfaces were modified to hydrophilic, and reductions in bacterial adhesion on surfaces were subsequently found to be dependent on the size of the patterns. The submicron patterned surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion, while the micron patterned surfaces led to increased bacterial adhesion. The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the S. epidermidis cell surfaces were extracted and purified, and were coated on a glass colloidal surface so that the adhesion force and separation energy in interactions of the EPS and the surface could be measured by colloidal probe atomic force microscopy. These results were consistent with the bacterial adhesion observations. Overall, the data suggest that the increased surface hydrophobicity and the decreased availability of the contact area contributes to a reduction in bacterial adhesion to the hydrophobic textured surfaces, while the availability of the contact area is the primary determinant factor for bacterial adhesion on hydrophilic textured surfaces."

Therapeutic aerosols include those directed towards improving mucociliary clearance of pathogens, stimulation of innate resistance to microbial infection, cytokine stimulation of immune function and delivery of antibiotics. In our opinion inhaled antimicrobials are underused, especially in patients with difficult-to-treat lung infections. The use of inhaled antimicrobial therapy has become an important part of the treatment of airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis and the prevention of invasive fungal infection in patients undergoing heart and lung transplantation. Cytokine inhaled therapy has also been explored in the treatment of neoplastic and infectious disease. The choice of pulmonary drug delivery systems remains critical as air-jet and ultrasonic nebulizer may deliver sub-optimum drug concentration if not used properly. In future development of this field, we recommend an emphasis on the study of the use of aerosolized hypertonic saline solution to reduce pathogen burden in the airways of subjects infected with microbes of low virulence, stimulation of innate resistance to prevent pneumonia in immunocompromised subjects using cytokines or synthetic pathogen-associated molecular pattern analogues and more opportunities for the use of inhaled antimicrobials.

Although Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination protects against active TB disease in some populations, its efficacy is suboptimal. Development of an effective TB vaccine is a top global priority that has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of protective immunity to TB. Thus far, preventing TB disease, rather than infection, has been the primary target for vaccine development. Several areas of research highlight the importance of including preinfection vaccines in the development pipeline. First, epidemiology and mathematical modeling studies indicate that a preinfection vaccine would have a high population-level impact for control of TB disease. Second, immunology studies support the rationale for targeting prevention of infection, with evidence that host responses may be more effective during acute infection than during chronic infection. Third, natural history studies indicate that resistance to TB infection occurs in a small percentage of the population. Fourth, case-control studies of BCG indicate that it may provide protection from infection. Fifth, prevention-of-infection trials would have smaller sample sizes and a shorter duration than disease prevention trials and would enable opportunities to search for correlates of immunity as well as serve as a criterion for selecting a vaccine product for testing in a larger TB disease prevention trial. Together, these points support expanding the focus of TB vaccine development efforts to include prevention of infection as a primary goal along with vaccines or other interventions that reduce the rate of transmission and reactivation."

A discontinuous distribution of nitroglycerin in the reservoir is responsible for the pulsed release. 2, 3, 4, or 6 fractions of nitroglycerin solution, which were separated from each other by sections with air, were filled into the tube reservoir.:The release studies show that the release patterns directly reflect the number of doses, which were filled into the tube. A lag:time of about 60 min was obtained, if the gas production is regulated by a 2.7 k Omega resistor. The drug is released during the pre-programmed time intervals within 6-7 h. Between the time intervals no drug release occurs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

These include zoonotic diseases and acute and chronic effects of ingesting natural and human-made xenobiotics. There are two major areas of concern over the presence of residues of antibiotics in animal-derived foodstuffs with regard to human health. The first is allergic reactions. Some antibiotics, such as penicillins can evoke allergic reactions even though small amounts of them are ingested or exposed by parenteral routes. The second is development of antibiotic resistance in gut bacteria of human. Recently multi-resistant pneumococcal, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and gram negative bacteria with extended-spectrum p-lactamases have spread all over the world, and are now a serious therapeutic problem in human. Although it is evident that drugs are required in the efficient production of meat, milk and eggs, their indiscriminate use should never be substituted for hygienic management of farm. Drug should be used only when they are required. In addition to veterinary drugs, environmental contaminants that were contaminated in feed, water and air can make residues in animal products. Mycotoxins, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals derived from industries can be harmful both to animal and human health. Most of organic contaminants, such as dioxin, PCBs and DDT, and metals are persistent in environment and biological organisms and can be accumulated in far and hard tissues. Some of them are suspected to have endocrine disrupting, carcinogenic, teratogenic, immunodepressive and nervous effects. The governmental agencies concerned make efforts to prevent residue problems; approval of drugs including withdrawal times of each preparation of drugs, establishment of tolerances, guidelines regarding drug use and sanitation enforcement of livestock products. National residue program is conducted to audit the status of the chemical residues in foods. Recently HACCP has been introduced to promote food safety from farm to table by reducing hazardous biological, chemical and physical factors. Animal Production Food Safety Program, Quality Assurance Programs, Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank are para- or non-governmental activities ensuring food safety. This topic will cover classification and usage or sources of chemical residues, their adverse effects, and chemical residue status of some countries. Issues are expanded to residue detection methodologies, toxicological and pharmacokinetic backgrounds of MRL and withdrawal time establishments, and the importance of non-governmental activities with regard to reducing chemical residues in food."

Eight hundred and sixty two samples including raw fish and fish market environments (samples from workers' hands, workers' knives, containers and work surface) were collected from the open-air fish markets in the Northern region of Iran. Results: Listeria spp. was isolated from 104/488 (21.3 \%) raw fish and 29/374 (7.8 \%) of samples from open-air fish market environment. The isolates of Listeria spp. included L. innocua (35.3 \%), L. monocytogenes (32.3 \%), L. seeligeri (18 \%), and L. ivanovii (14.3 \%). Of the 43 L. monocytogenes isolates, 31 (72.1 \%), 10 (23.3 \%) and 2 (4.7 \%) belonged to serovars 1/2a, 4b, and 1/2b, respectively. The inlA, inlB, inlC, inlJ, actA, hlyA, iap, plcA, and prfA virulence-associated genes were detected in almost all of the L. monocytogenes isolates. The Listeria spp. isolates showed high resistance against tetracycline (23.3 \%), penicillin G, and cephalothin (each 16.5 \%). Besides, we observed significant resistance level to tetracycline (27.9 \%), ampicillin (20.9 \%), cephalothin, penicillin G, and streptomycin (each 16.3 \%) in the L. monocytogenes isolates. All of the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, gentamicin, kanamycin, and pefloxacin. We found that tetM (25.6 \%), tetA (23.3 \%), ampC (14 \%), and penA (11.6 \%) were the most prevalent antibiotic resistance genes in the L. monocytogenes isolates. Conclusions: Recovery of potentially pathogenic L. monocytogenes from raw fish and environment of open-air fish market samples in this study is a convincing evidence for the zoonotic potential of listeriosis."

The widespread use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in hospitals, domestic residences, agricultural and industrial facilities has increased their discharge into the water bodies, and its toxicity has started to manifest in different biological components of ecosystems. The development of methods for sample treatment and instrumental analysis techniques has enabled the separation, identification and quantification of active ingredients and degradates with higher environmental impact, at concentrations of parts per billion or even parts per trillion. In addition, in vitro and in vivo assays have demonstrated their ecotoxicity in water, driving them to the classification of emerging organic pollutants, whose waste is indeterminate. Although their adverse effects are still unknown, they could have strong implications for global public health.

To date most attention has focused on biofilms that arise from the colonization of solid-liquid or solid-air interfaces. It is of interest that colonization of the interface between air and liquid, which can be selectively advantageous for aerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria, has been rarely studied, although it may present a major problem in industrial aquatic systems. In this work we investigated the role of a biofilm at the interface between air and liquid (pellicle) in the susceptibility of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to stress conditions. For a control we used a mutant that had lost its ability to synthesize cellulose and thin aggregative fimbriae and thus did not produce the pellicle. Resistance of bacteria from the pellicle to heat, acidification, and chlorination was compared to resistance of planktonic cells from the logarithmic and stationary phases of growth. Pellicle cells were significantly more resistant to chlorination, and thus the surrounding matrix conferred protection against the reactive sodium hypochlorite. However, the stress management of pellicle cells in response to heat and low pH was not enhanced compared to that of stationary-phase cells. A long-period of incubation resulted in endogenous hydrolysis of the pellicle matrix. This phenomenon provides a potential new approach to combat microbial cells in biofilms."

Bacterial inactivation was determined by direct quantification of colony forming units. The plasma activated air (afterglow) was bactericidal against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis seeded on culture media, laminate, and linoleum vinyl. In general, E. coli was more susceptible to plasma exposure. A bacterial reduction was observed with the application of air alone on a laminate surface.

METHODS: We have, therefore, evaluated the real prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by retrospectively examining the glucose hydrogen (H(2)) breath test in 96 patients with a previous symptoms-based IBS diagnosis. Moreover, we wished to evaluate the efficacy of the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in eradicating a SIBO syndrome. RESULTS: The breath test showed a SIBO syndrome in 44 out 96 IBS patients (45.8%), who had H(2) peaks in the expired air higher than 10 ppm over the baseline value (mean: 36.2+/-18.7 ppm). All these patients were treated with rifaximin (1 200 mg/day for 14 days) followed by a twenty-day cycle of probiotics. Twenty-three of them returned to a control visit within 4-5 months: the glucose breath test became negative in 19 cases (82.6%; P<0.01) and mean peak value of H(2) significantly decreased from 40.9+/-20.4 to 4.78+/-8.42 ppm (P<0.001). Patients reported also a substantial improvement of the IBS symptoms. No adverse effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a SIBO syndrome is present in about half of patients with an IBS diagnosis and, therefore, it should always be suspected in these patients. Moreover, the use of broad-spectrum non absorbable antibiotics, such as rifaximin, represents a safe and effective approach to SIBO with a low risk of causing microbial resistance."

Acinetobacter spp. are multidrug-resistant bacteria that grow well in water and cause infections with unexplained, increased summer prevalence. In August, 1996, eight infants acquired Acinetobacter spp. bloodstream infection (A-BSI) while in a nursery in the Bahamas; three infants died and an investigation was initiated. Methods. A case patient was defined as any newborn in the nursery during August 6 to 13, 1996, with A-BSI. To identify risk factors for A-BSI we conducted a retrospective cohort study and performed environmental cultures and air sampling using settle plates. The genetic relatedness of environmental isolates was assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Results. Of 33 patients in the nursery 8 (24\%) met the case definition. Patients with peripheral iv catheters were more likely to develop A-BSI (8 of 21 vs. 0 of 10, P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis among patients with iv catheters indicated that only exposure to one nurse was an independent risk factor for developing A-BSI (P < 0.005). Nursery settle plates were more likely to grow Acinetobacter spp. than were settle plates from other hospital areas (8 of 9 vs. 0 of 5, P < 0.005); cultures from nursery air conditioners also grew Acinetobacter spp. Environmental isolates were genetically diverse. After installation of a new air conditioner in May, 1995, A-BSIs occurred more frequently during months of increased absolute humidity or environmental dew point. Conclusions. Acinetobacter spp. may cause nosocomial BSI and death among infants during periods of polyclonal airborne dissemination; breaks in aseptic technique during: iv medication."

Many families adopting internationally travel to their child's birth country at least once before bringing their new family member home. Most commonly, families are traveling to the republics of the former Soviet Union, China, Guatemala, or other developing countries in Asia, Central or South America, or Africa. Family members who travel and family and close contacts of the child who remain at home all need information about protecting themselves during travel and preventing acquisition of diseases that could be transmitted by the internationally adopted child after arrival in the United States. Travel for adoption presents risks that are different from those encountered by the tourist or business traveler or those travelers who travel to visit friends and relatives (VFR travelers). Although the application to adopt internationally usually requires at least I or 2 years of preparation, families may be notified about travel within 2 to 3 weeks of departure. Adoptive families may not have a choice in their travel destination or itinerary, the time of travel, or accommodations during the trip. They may not speak the local language or have regular access to interpreters and may be apprehensive about accommodations, visa requirements, and overseas procedures. They may be inexperienced first-time parents or may be traveling with other children who require attention to their own needs. Travel for adoption may lead to prolonged and unexpected stays in the country, possibly with accommodation in nontourist facilities, such as local apartments, hostels, or their child's orphanage. Because of a desire to please the many individuals with power over the adoption process (eg, facilitators, interpreters, court and government officials, agency and orphanage personnel), families may accept risks they would ordinarily avoid, such as eating local foods or drinking potentially unsafe water, drinking more or different types of alcohol, seeking medical care in rural health facilities, or using local means of transport without seat belts or car seats. Families may be exposed to extreme air pollution, farm animals, second-hand cigarette smoke, or infectious agents, such as tuberculosis, that they might otherwise avoid were it not for the adoption process. As the field of travel medicine evolves, distinct groups of travelers with specific risks have been identified, such as VFR travelers. It is possible that the families and close contacts of internationally adopted children comprise such a group. Better description of these risks through systematic study may lead to improved interventions in this population in the future. This article addresses the current body of knowledge and recommendations for preventing travel-related illness in this group (see Appendix)."

Sputum was reexamined and Mycobacterium, later proved as Mycobacterium tuberculosis with DNA probe method, was detected in the sputum specimen. Anti-mycobacterial drugs were administered and subjective symptoms, laboratory, and chest X-ray findings improved. Infected bulla caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rare, but when it is resistant to common empirical therapy, Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be considered as one of its causative agents."

Appropriately diluted cell suspensions of E. coli and P. fluorescens were inoculated onto agar and exposed to NAI (> 2 x 10(6) ions/cm(3)) in an airtight chamber. Although no bacterial killing was observed after short exposure (15-30 min), longer exposure upto 4 hours caused 33% and 42% reduction in viability of E. coli and P. fluorescens, respectively. Maximum killing was observed when the plates were positioned in front of the NAI generator. Young exponential phase cells of P. fluorescens were more resistant (8% reduction in viability) as compared to stationary phase cells (42% reduction in viability). Also, the starved cells displayed less reduction in viability (33%) as compared to normal cells (42%). The susceptibility of bacterial strains to NAI varies depending upon the strain type, their physiological state as well as the distance/orientation with respect to the source. Although application of NAI for decreasing the ambient microbial load is a valid option; extended exposures might be required for controlling physiologically different cells such as exponential phase cells and/or starved cells."
