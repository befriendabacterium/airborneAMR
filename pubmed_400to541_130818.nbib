TI  - Effects of tetracycline on antibiotic resistance and removal of fecal indicator
      bacteria in aerated and unaerated leachfield mesocosms.
PG  - 1571-8
AB  - Antibiotics can be present in low concentrations in domestic wastewater, but
      little is known about their effect on bacteria in onsite wastewater treatment
      systems. Mesocosms, consisting of soil-filled lysimeters representing the
      leachfield of a septic system under aerated (AIR) and unaerated (LEACH)
      conditions, were used to study the effects of tetracycline addition (5 mg L(-1)) 
      to septic tank effluent on tetracycline resistance in the fecal indicator
      bacteria Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci, and on their removal. The
      mesocosms were dosed with antibiotic for 10 days, and effects monitored for 52
      days. The fraction of resistant bacteria in mesocosm drainage water relative to
      that in septic tank effluent, GammaRes, for E. coli ranged from 0 to 0.66 in the 
      AIR treatment and from 0 to 3.32 in the LEACH treatment. For fecal streptococci, 
      GammaRes ranged from 0 to 0.41 and from 0.63 to 1.06 in the AIR and LEACH
      treatments, respectively. No significant differences in antibiotic resistance of 
      fecal indicator bacteria were observed among sampling dates in soil or water from
      either treatment. Tetracycline had no significant effect on removal of fecal
      indicator bacteria, which ranged from 99.9 to 100% for E. coli and from 95.9 to
      100% for fecal streptococci. Our results suggest that short-term addition of
      tetracycline at environmentally-relevant concentrations is likely to have minimal
      consequences on pathogen removal from wastewater and development of antibiotic
      resistance among pathogenic bacteria in leachfield soil.

      aeruginosa.
PG  - 47-60
AB  - Growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 atmospheres absolute of 100% oxygen at 37
      degrees C produced two types of abnormal colonies--stunted, rough colonies,
      termed dwarfs, and large, domed, mucoid colonies, termed giants. The occurrence
      of these variants depended upon the partial pressure of oxygen and the inoculum
      size. Subculture of dwarf or giant colonies produced a mixture of both colony
      types after incubation in hyperbaric oxygen, and colonies of normal appearance
      after incubation in air. Electron micrographs of ultrathin sections showed that
      cells from dwarf colonies had a more clearly defined envelope region than cells
      from normal colonies. Giant colony and normal colony-derived cells were of
      similar appearance. Whole cells from giant colonies contained more carbohydrate, 
      readily extractable lipid, neutral lipid and free fatty acid than cells from
      normal colonies; the two cell types showed similar contents of
      2-keto,3-deoxyoctonic acid and total phospholipid, but different proportions of
      individual phospholipids. Cells from dwarf, giant and normal (air-grown) colonies
      were incubated in air on nutrient agar containing either polymyxin, tetracycline 
      or phenoxyethanol. Relative to cells from normal colonies, cells from dwarf
      colonies showed enhanced resistance to all three agents and cells from giant
      colonies showed enhanced resistance to polymyxin and tetracycline only. The
      resistance of cells from variant colonies was lost following a single subculture 
      in air in the absence of antibacterial agents. It was concluded that the
      envelopes of cells from dwarf and giant colonies differed both from each other
      and from those of normal cells. These differences, and the formation of variant
      colonies, appeared to result from bacterial adaptation to hyperbaric oxygen
      rather than from mutation.

TI  - Influence of antimicrobial compounds and modified atmosphere packaging on
      radiation sensitivity of Listeria monocytogenes present in ready-to-use carrots
      (Daucus carota).
PG  - 221-7
AB  - Radiosensitization of Listeria monocytogenes was determined in the presence of
      trans-cinnamaldehyde, Spanish oregano, winter savory, and Chinese cinnamon on
      peeled minicarrots packed under air or under a modified atmosphere (60% O2, 30%
      CO2, and 10% N2). Samples were inoculated with L. monocytogenes HPB 2812 serovar 
      1/2a (106 CFU/g) and were coated separately with each active compound (0.5%,
      wt/wt) before being packaged under air or the modified atmosphere and irradiated 
      at doses from 0.07 to 2.4 kGy. Results indicated that the bacterium was more
      resistant to irradiation under air in the absence of active compound. The dose
      required to reduce L. monocytogenes population by 1 log CFU (D10) was 0.36 kGy
      for samples packed under air and 0.17 kGy for those packed under the modified
      atmosphere. The active compounds evaluated in this study had an effect on the
      radiation sensitivity of L. monocytogenes on carrots. The most efficient compound
      was trans-cinnamaldehyde, where a mean 3.8-fold increase in relative radiation
      sensitivity was observed for both atmospheres compared with the control. The
      addition of winter savory and Chinese cinnamon produced a similar increase in
      relative radiation sensitivity but only when samples where packed under modified 
      atmosphere conditions.

      Staphylococcus aureus using tandem measurements.

LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2012.05.003 [doi]
AB  - Discrimination of methicillin resistant (MRSA) and sensitive (MSSA) strains of
      Staphylococcus aureus, was achieved by the specially selected lytic bacteriophage
      with a wide host range of S. aureus strains and a penicillin-binding protein (PBP
      2a) specific antibody. A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring 
      (QCM-D) was employed to analyze bacteria-phage interactions. The lytic phages
      were transformed into phage spheroids by exposure to water-chloroform interface. 
      Phage spheroid monolayers were transferred onto QCM-D sensors by
      Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Biosensors were tested in the flow mode with
      bacterial water suspensions, while collecting frequency and energy dissipation
      changes. Bacteria-spheroid interactions resulted in decreased resonance frequency
      and an increase in dissipation energy for both MRSA and MSSA strains. Following
      the bacterial binding, these sensors were further exposed to a flow of the
      penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2a) specific antibody conjugated latex beads.
      Sensors tested with MRSA responded to PBP 2a antibody beads; while sensors
      examined with MSSA gave no response. This experimental difference establishes an 
      unambiguous discrimination between methicillin resistant and sensitive S. aureus 
      strains. Both free and immobilized bacteriophages strongly inhibit bacterial
      growth on solid/air interfaces and in water suspensions. After lytic phages are
      transformed into spheroids, they retain their strong lytic activity and
      demonstrate high bacterial capture efficiency. The phage and phage spheroids can 
      be used for screening and disinfection of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Other
      applications may include use on biosensors, bacteriophage therapy, and
      antimicrobial surfaces.

      antimycobacterials.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly dreaded, infectious, chronic, airborne disease
      affecting more than two million people all around the world, with more than eight
      million cases every calendar year. TB is the second leading infectious cause of
      death after HIV/AIDS. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been
      undertaken to develop new anti-TB agents. The current frontline therapy for TB
      consists of administering three or more different drugs (usually isoniazid,
      rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) over an extended period of time. But
      these drugs will take 6-12 months to cure TB, along with many side effects;
      hence, there is an urgent need to explore new anti-TB agents. Quinoxaline
      derivatives are a class of compounds that show a spectrum of biological
      properties and the interest in these compounds is exponentially growing within
      the field of medicinal chemistry. Quinoxaline-1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives have
      shown to improve the biological results and are endowed with anti-viral,
      anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, and anti-protozoal activities with application in
      many other therapeutic areas. Since quinoxaline derivatives are regarded as a new
      class of effective anti-TB candidates, their 1,4-di-N-oxide analogues may show
      promising in vitro and in vivo anti-TB activities and might be able to prevent
      the drug resistance to a certain extent. Therefore, the main aim of this review
      is to focus on important quinoxaline and quinoxaline-1,4-di-N-oxide analogues
      that have shown anti-TB activities, and their structure-activity relationships
      for designing anti-TB agents with better efficacies. The present review will be
      helpful in providing insights for rational designs of more active and less toxic 
      quinoxaline-based anti-TB prodrugs.

AB  - The whiB-like genes (1-7) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are involved in cell
      division, nutrient starvation, pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance and stress
      sensing. Although the biochemical properties of WhiB1, WhiB3 and WhiB4 are known,
      there is no information about the other proteins. Here, we elucidate in detail
      the biochemical and biophysical properties of WhiB2, WhiB5, WhiB6 and WhiB7 of M.
      tuberculosis and present a comprehensive comparative study on the molecular
      properties of all WhiB proteins. UV-Vis spectroscopy has suggested the presence
      of a redox-sensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster in each of the WhiB proteins, which remains
      stably bound to the proteins in the presence of 8 m urea. The [2Fe-2S] cluster of
      each protein was oxidation labile but the rate of cluster loss decreased under
      reducing environments. The [2Fe-2S] cluster of each WhiB protein responded
      differently to the oxidative effect of air and oxidized glutathione. In all
      cases, disassembly of the [2Fe-2S] cluster was coupled with the oxidation of
      cysteine-thiols and the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds. Both CD 
      and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that WhiB proteins are structurally
      divergent members of the same family. Similar to WhiB1, WhiB3 and WhiB4, apo
      WhiB5, WhiB6 and WhiB7 also reduced the disulfide of insulin, a model substrate. 
      However, the reduction efficiency varied significantly. Surprisingly, WhiB2 did
      not reduce the insulin disulfide, even though its basic properties were similar
      to those of others. The structural and functional divergence among WhiB proteins 
      indicated that each WhiB protein is a distinguished member of the same family and
      together they may represent a novel redox system for M. tuberculosis.

      midline; one half was subjected to an ice-water immersion chill in an agitated
      bath for 50 min, whereas the reciprocal half was subjected to an air chill in a 1
      degrees C cold room for 150 min. Total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia
      coli, and Campylobacter were enumerated from half-carcass rinses. Species of
      Campylobacter isolates was determined by a commercial PCR method, which was
      followed by molecular subtyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and
      determination of antimicrobial susceptibility to 9 drugs. Although significantly 
      fewer of each bacterial type were detected per milliliter from immersion-chilled 
      carcasses than from air-chilled carcasses, in each case the difference was less
      than 1 log(10) cfu/mL. Chilling method did not affect species; both Campylobacter
      jejuni and Campylobacter coli were recovered. Results of pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis subtyping did not suggest that either chilling method selected
      for any specific subtypes; most subtypes were found on carcass halves used for
      both the air chill and water immersion chill. Resistance to 2 antimicrobial drugs
      was noted in 9 C. coli isolates, 6 from air-chilled carcass halves and 3 from
      immersion-chilled carcass halves. These data showed that immersion-chilled
      carcasses had lower numbers of bacteria; however, the difference was not large
      and may have been due to simple dilution. Both methods were effective for
      lowering carcass temperature, and neither chilling method seemed to select for
      specific species, subtypes, or antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter.

TI  - In silico design and enantioselective synthesis of functionalized monocyclic
      3-amino-1-carboxymethyl-beta-lactams as inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins
      of resistant bacteria.
LID - 10.1002/chem.201801868 [doi]
AB  - As a complement to the renowned bicyclic beta-lactam antibiotics, monocyclic
      analogues provide a breath of fresh air in the battle against resistant bacteria.
      In that framework, the present study discloses the in silico design and
      unprecedented ten-step synthesis of eleven nocardicin-like enantiomerically pure 
      2-{3-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)acetamido]-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl}aceti
      c acids starting from serine as a readily accessible precursor. The capability of
      this novel class of monocyclic 3-amino-beta-lactams to inhibit penicillin-binding
      proteins (PBPs) of various (resistant) bacteria was assessed, revealing the
      potential of alfa-benzylidenecarboxylates as interesting leads in the pursuit of 
      novel PBP inhibitors. No deactivation by representative enzymes belonging to the 
      four beta-lactamase classes was observed, while weak inhibition of class C
      beta-lactamase P99 was demonstrated.

AB  - Use of antimicrobial feed additives in food animal production is associated with 
      selection for drug resistance in bacterial pathogens, which can then be released 
      into the environment through occupational exposures, high volume ventilation of
      animal houses, and land application of animal wastes. We tested the hypothesis
      that current methods of transporting food animals from farms to slaughterhouses
      may result in pathogen releases and potential exposures of persons in vehicles
      traveling on the same road. Air and surface samples were taken from cars driving 
      behind poultry trucks for 17 miles. Air conditioners and fans were turned off and
      windows fully opened. Background and blank samples were used for quality control.
      Samples were analyzed for susceptible and drug-resistant strains. Results
      indicate an increase in the number of total aerobic bacteria including both
      susceptible and drug-resistant enterococci isolated from air and surface samples,
      and suggest that food animal transport in open crates introduces a novel route of
      exposure to harmful microorganisms and may disseminate these pathogens into the
      general environment. These findings support the need for further exposure
      characterization, and attention to improving methods of food animal transport,
      especially in highly trafficked regions of high density farming such as the
      Delmarva Peninsula.

TI  - Oral species of Fusobacterium from human and environmental samples.
PG  - 345-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was the characterization and identification of
      oral Fusobacterium in patients with and without periodontal disease, and from
      spittoons and air-water syringes. The antimicrobial susceptibility of this
      bacterium was evaluated. METHOD: Subgingival samples were taken using sterilized 
      absorbent paper points. Spittoon samples were collected using sterile swabs
      around the drain area with shut off, and air-water syringe samples by washing the
      tip with Ringer solution. Samples were transferred in tubes under CO2 flux.
      Diluted samples were inoculated on to Omata and Disraely agar and blood agar
      plates, which were incubated in anaerobiosis, at 37 degrees C, for 4 days.
      Bacterial species were identified biochemically. MIC was determined using an agar
      dilution method. RESULTS: Periodontal patients, healthy subjects, spittoons and
      air-water syringes were 80%, 67.6%, 37.8% and 3.3% positive to Fusobacterium,
      respectively. Clindamycin, imipenem, lincomycin, metronidazole and tetracycline
      were active against all human and environmental isolates. Eighteen isolates
      resistant to ampicillin or penicillin G produced beta-lactamases. The presence of
      human oral bacteria in items of dental equipment supports the hypothesis that
      such equipment may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of pathogenic
      organisms. CONCLUSION: Pieces of dental equipment may serve as a vehicle for the 
      transmission of oral pathogenic organisms.

TI  - Reversal of mitomycin C resistance by overexpression of bioreductive enzymes in
      Chinese hamster ovary cells.
PG  - 7770-6
AB  - The clinical utility of antineoplastic agents is limited by the development of
      drug resistance by tumors. Mitomycin C (MC) is a bacterial product that must be
      enzymatically reduced to exert anticancer activity. We have demonstrated that
      expression of the bacterial MC resistance-associated (MCRA) protein in Chinese
      hamster ovary (CHO) cells confers profound resistance to this antibiotic under
      aerobic conditions, but not under hypoxia. MCRA produces resistance to MC by
      redox cycling of the activated hydroquinone intermediate back to the prodrug
      form. A CHO cell line developed by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations
      of MC likewise expressed high level resistance to MC in air, but not under
      hypoxia. The overexpression of DT-diaphorase and NADPH:cytochrome c (P-450)
      reductase, two enzymes known to activate MC, restored sensitivity to MC in both
      MCRA-transfected and drug-selected cell lines. The level of sensitization was
      proportional to the quantity of enzyme activity expressed, supporting the concept
      that the levels of these two activating enzymes are important for sensitivity to 
      MC. The findings of resistance to MC in air but not under hypoxic conditions and 
      of restoration of sensitivity to MC by increasing levels of DT-diaphorase
      activity, properties not adequately explained by other resistance mechanisms
      (i.e., decreases in MC activation, repair of DNA lesions, and/or drug efflux),
      support the hypothesis that a functional mammalian homologue of MCRA may be
      involved in producing resistance to MC.

AB  - AS-48 is a bacteriocin with potential application as food biopreservative. In
      order to optimize its use for oral consumption, we assess the impact of
      gastrointestinal digestion, both in bulk and adsorbed at the air-water interface.
      Analysis of AS-48 digestion fragments in bulk by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, and MALDI-TOF
      proves that the previous pepsin exposition promotes digestion by
      trypsin/chymotrypsin by exposing new cleavage sites. Regarding adsorbed AS-48,
      the in vitro digestion profile shows that the conformational change undergone by 
      AS-48 upon adsorption affects its digestibility. Gastrointestinal enzymes cleave 
      only susceptible residues, which are oriented into the aqueous phase, while
      hydrophobic susceptible residues remain undigested. Evaluation of the elasticity 
      of the adsorbed layer confirms also the presence of undigested AS-48. These
      results are important towards the use of AS-48 in food formulations; assuring
      that some intact AS-48 resists digestion guarantees its antibacterial activity
      throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are alternatives to conventional antibiotics
      against multi-drug resistant bacteria with low potential for developing microbial
      resistance. The design of such molecules requires understanding of the mechanisms
      of action, particularly the interaction with bacteria cell membranes. In this
      work, we determine the mechanism responsible for the higher activity against
      Escherichia coli of the C-terminal lysine dimer of magainin 2, (MG2)2K, in
      comparison to the monomeric peptide magainin 2 (MG2). Langmuir monolayers and
      vesicles made with the E. coli lipid extract were used to address the two
      possible states for the peptide-membrane interaction, namely the "binding state" 
      and "pore state", respectively. The incorporation of MG2 and (MG2)2K in lipid
      monolayers at the air-water interface caused slight differences in surface
      pressure isotherms and polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption
      (PM-IRRAS) spectra, and therefore the difference in activity is not associated
      with the binding state. In contrast, large differences were observed in the
      leakage experiments where (MG2)2K was shown to disrupt the large unilamellar
      vesicles to a much higher extent owing to efficient pore formation. The binding
      and penetration of MG2 and (MG2)2K were also probed with molecular dynamics (MD) 
      simulations for bilayers made with
      1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-gly
      cero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPE:POPG). (MG2)2K forms disordered toroidal pores at a 
      significant lower concentration than for MG2. In summary, the combination of
      experimental and computational simulation results indicated that the
      "pre-assembling state" of (MG2)2K dimer leads to a reduced number of molecules
      and shorter time being required to kill E. coli.

TI  - Antibacterial Activities of Azole Complexes Combined with Silver Nanoparticles.
LID - E361 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules23020361 [doi]
AB  - Growing antimicrobial resistance is considered a potential threat for human
      health security by health organizations, such as the WHO, CDC and FDA, pointing
      to MRSA as an example. New antibacterial drugs and complex derivatives are needed
      to combat the development of bacterial resistance. Six new copper and cobalt
      complexes of azole derivatives were synthesized and isolated as air-stable solids
      and characterized by melting point analyses, elemental analyses,
      thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and infrared and ultraviolet/visible
      spectroscopy. The analyses and spectral data showed that the complexes had 1:1
      (M:L) stoichiometries and tetrahedral geometries, the latter being supported by
      DFT calculations. The antibacterial activities of the metal complexes by
      themselves and combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs; 2 mug mL(-1)) were
      assessed in vitro by broth microdilution assays against eight bacterial strains
      of clinical relevance. The results showed that the complexes alone exhibited
      moderate antibacterial activities. However, when the metal complexes were
      combined with AgNPs, their antibacterial activities increased (up to 10-fold in
      the case of complex 5), while human cell viabilities were maintained. The minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC50) values were in the range of 25-500 mug mL(-1).
      This study thus presents novel approaches for the design of materials for
      fighting bacterial resistance. The use of azole complexes combined with AgNPs
      provides a new alternative against bacterial infections, especially when current 
      treatments are associated with the rapid development of antibiotic resistance.

TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis--hospital epidemiology and the detection of
      methicillin resistance.
PG  - 1-59
AB  - Infections in immunocompromised patients and in patients with indwelling
      prosthetic devices are often caused by hospital strains of Staphylococcus
      epidermidis resistant to methicillin. Tests for the detection of methicillin
      resistance, indicating resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics, were evaluated 
      in order to define a suitable screening test. A broth tube breakpoint test with a
      large inoculum, 10(7) colony forming units (cfu), gave the highest recovery of
      resistant strains. False resistance due to hyperproduction of beta-lactamase was 
      excluded. The results correlated completely with the detection of the resistance 
      gene, mecA, by the polymerase chain reaction. In 2/3 of the resistant strains
      tested the expression of the methicillin resistance was heterogeneous, only one
      cell in 10(2) to 10(4) expressed the resistance within 72 h in both. In broth
      screening tests an inoculum of at least 10(6) cfu therefore was required to
      detect all resistant strains within 24 h. Using agar dilution, 48 h incubation
      must be considered. In disc diffusion tests reliable results were obtained after 
      only 16 h of incubation when discs containing cephradine 5 and 30 micrograms,
      oxacillin 1 microgram or cephalexin 30 micrograms were used, and the first disc
      is recommended for routine work. The epidemiology of S. epidermidis strains
      resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or gentamicin was studied in an isolation unit for
      patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Antibiograms and plasmids were
      used for typing and 31 such strains were found. Of 54 staff members 10 were
      colonized in the nares only, two in the nares and perineum and one in the nares
      and stool. In ambient air and on the clothes of staff a few of the strains
      predominated quantitatively. These strains colonized the skin of some of the
      patients who seemed to be the main dispersers. Possible routes of cross-infection
      were indirect contact transfer via the hands and clothes of staff (82% of the
      clothes were contaminated), and direct as well as indirect airborne transmission.
      To study the effects of chlorhexidine on skin bacteria, ten nurses washed one arm
      with chlorhexidine-detergent every morning for 3 weeks; the other arm served as
      control. The depression of the normal skin flora did not lead to a colonization
      with more antibiotic-resistant hospital strains. During the wash period the
      counts of antibiotic-resistant S. epidermidis on the treated arms were
      significantly reduced compared with the control arms, as also were the number of 
      different strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - The emergence of issues related to environment from ECs is a topic under serious 
      discussions worldwide in recent years. Indian scenario is not an exception as it 
      is tremendously growing in its rate of production and consumption of compounds
      belongs to ECs categories. However, a comprehensive documentation on the
      occurrence of ECs and consequent ARGs as well as their toxic effects on
      vertebrates on Indian context is still lacking. In the present study, an
      extensive literature survey was carried out to get an idea on the geographical
      distribution of ECs in various environmental matrices (water, air, soil, sediment
      and sludge) and biological samples by dividing the entire subcontinent into six
      zones based on climatic, geographical and cultural features. A comprehensive
      assessment of the toxicological effects of ECs and the consequent antibiotic
      resistant genes has been included. It is found that studies on the screening of
      ECs are scarce and concentrated in certain geological locations. A total of 166
      individual compounds belonging to 36 categories have been reported so far.
      Pharmaceuticals and drugs occupy the major share in these compounds followed by
      PFASs, EDCs, PCPs, ASWs and flame retardants. This review throws light on the
      alarming situation in India where the highest ever reported values of
      concentrations of some of these compounds are from India. This necessitates a
      national level monitoring system for ECs in order to assess the magnitude of
      environmental risks posed by these compounds.

TI  - Nasal acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus in a subdivided and mechanically
      ventilated ward: endemic prevalence of a single staphylococcal strain.
PG  - 417-33
AB  - An investigation was made of nasal acquisition of Staphylococcus aureus and of
      staphylococcal wound sepsis in a hospital ward divided into two sections and
      provided with mechanical ventilation, so that there was no transfer of air from
      one of the sections to the other. Although the strains of S. aureus found in the 
      air, and those colonizing the noses of patients, in the protected section could
      seldom be related to patients nursed elsewhere in the ward, the mechanical
      ventilation did not lead to any significant reduction in the degree of
      contamination of the air or in the rate of nasal acquisition of S. aureus.Even in
      the protected section, nearly 20% of the strains of S. aureus recovered from the 
      air could not be related to known nasal carriers. Since this proportion was
      nearly as great as that found in the absence of directed air-flow, it seems
      probable that these strains were derived either from undetected sources within
      the section or were dispersed from the clothes of persons who entered it.Nearly
      one-third of the nasal acquisitions in the ward could not be related to known
      nasal carriers, but about one-half of these (16%) were probably ;spurious' and
      half of the remainder (8%) could be related to strains recovered from patients'
      lesions or drawsheets, leaving no more than 8% unaccounted for. A short
      investigation in which both drawsheet and perineal samples were examined showed
      that drawsheet samples did not give a reliable indication of perineal carriage
      unassociated with nasal carriage.During the period of the investigation, a single
      strain of S. aureus that was resistant to a wide range of antibiotics established
      itself in the ward. The most notable character of this strain was the profuse
      dispersion of it by carriers. As a consequence, staphylococcal wound sepsis
      increased, with nearly three-quarters of the infections attributable to this
      strain, and nasal carrier rates increased with length of stay in the ward, over
      20% of patients who stayed 5-6 weeks acquiring the strain.

TI  - Susceptibility of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in the lower St Lawrence
      region, Quebec.
PG  - 279-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the susceptibility of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci
      (GABHS) in the lower St Lawrence region, Quebec to different antibiotics,
      particularly macrolides, and to compare different antibiogram methods (disk
      diffusion, E-test and microdilution) and incubation atmospheres (ambient air and 
      5% carbon dioxide). METHODS: A total of 384 strains of GABHS isolated from 377
      patients (throat 335; other sites 49) from three hospitals in the lower St
      Lawrence region were analyzed for their susceptibility to erythromycin,
      clarithromycin, azithromycin, penicillin, clindamycin, cephalothin, rifampin and 
      vancomycin by disk diffusion on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar supplemented with 5%
      defibrinated sheep blood (MHB) at 35 masculineC in 5% carbon dioxide. Strains
      that were found to be intermediately resistant or resistant to one of the
      antibiotics by disc diffusion, strains from sites other than throat, and a sample
      of 97 pharyngeal strains were evaluated by E-test on MHB (35 masculineC, 5%
      carbon dioxide) for their susceptibility to the antibiotics erythromycin,
      clarithromycin, azithromycin, penicillin, clindamycin and ceftriaxone. In
      addition, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for
      erythromycin and azithromycin by broth microdilution using MH broth supplemented 
      with 2.5 % of lysed horse blood (35 masculineC, ambient air) on strains that were
      resistant or intermediately resistant to the macrolides (erythromycin,
      clarithromycin, azithromycin). An evaluation was also carried out on these
      strains to determine the influence of the incubating atmosphere (ambient air
      versus 5% carbon dioxide) on susceptibility results obtained by disk diffusion
      (erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin) and E-test (erythromycin and
      azithromycin) methods. RESULTS: Nine strains (2%) from nine patients (throat
      eight, pus one) were resistant to all macrolides as tested by three different
      techniques (disk diffusion, E-test and microdilution). All strains were
      susceptible to all the other antibiotics tested. For the strains intermediately
      resistant or resistant to macrolides, incubation in a 5% carbon dioxide
      atmosphere was associated with a reduction in the diameter of inhibition
      determined by disk diffusion (P<0.001) with frequent minor variations in
      interpretation, and with an increase in the MIC by E-test (P<0.001), which had no
      impact on interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance of GABHS to macrolides was not 
      common (2%) in the lower St Lawrence Region. GABHS susceptibility to erythromycin
      seemed to predict the susceptibility to the other macrolides. Significant
      variation in antibiogram results (disk diffusion and E-test) of GABHS
      susceptibility to macrolides was related to the incubation atmosphere and may
      have an impact on the interpretation of disk diffusion results.

TI  - Prophylactic use of itraconazole for the prevention of invasive pulmonary
      aspergillosis in high risk neutropenic patients.
PG  - 163-74
AB  - Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an increasing cause of morbidity and
      mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. A major program of
      construction work close to our unit prompted us to evaluate the efficacy of
      itraconazole prophylaxis in preventing IPA in these patients. During September
      1994 to December 1995, 77 patients undergoing 96 neutropenic episodes (mean
      duration, 19.3 days +/- 9.1) received itraconazole as antifungal prophylaxis. All
      patients were treated in laminar air flow rooms. Itraconazole was administered at
      a loading dose of 600mg/d, (day 1 to day 3) and 400mg/d on the following days, in
      87 instances. In the remaining episodes, the daily dose was 200 or 400mg. Oral
      doses were adjusted to reach a plasma itraconazole level (PIL) above 1000ng/l. In
      cases of inadequate PIL or poor oral intake, IV AmphoB was started at a 20 mg
      daily dose. Five cases of IPA (proven n = 2, probable n = 3) were observed. This 
      represents an incidence of 5.2% of the total number of episodes. One out of 67
      (2%) treatment episodes with adequate PIL were associated with IPA as compared to
      4 of 29 (14%) episodes with inadequate PIL, (p < 0.02). AmphoB was added in 28
      cases because of low PIL (n = 25), and/or antibiotic-resistant fever persistent
      pulmonary infiltrate (n = 8). These results need to be interpreted with caution, 
      because of the absence of randomization or a control group. The efficacy of
      Itraconazole in neutropenic patients with high risk IPA has to be confirmed on
      larger and prospective studies.

AB  - Clean drinking water and sanitation are fundamental human rights recognized by
      the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and the Human Rights Council in 2010
      (Resolution 64/292). In modern societies, water is not related only to drinking, 
      it is also widely used for personal and home hygiene, and leisure. Ongoing human 
      population and subsequent environmental stressors challenge the current standards
      on safe drinking and recreational water, requiring regular updating. Also, a
      changing Earth and its increasingly frequent extreme weather events and climatic 
      changes underpin the necessity to adjust regulation to a risk-based approach.
      Although fungi were never introduced to water quality regulations, the incidence 
      of fungal infections worldwide is growing, and changes in antimicrobial
      resistance patterns are taking place. The presence of fungi in different types of
      water has been thoroughly investigated during the past 30 years only in Europe,
      and more than 400 different species were reported from ground-, surface-, and
      tap-water. The most frequently reported fungi, however, were not waterborne, but 
      are frequently related to soil, air, and food. This review focuses on waterborne 
      filamentous fungi, unreported from food, that offer a pathogenic potential.

TI  - Prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Salmonella isolated from a poultry farm
      and processing plant environment in the State of Kuwait.
PG  - 367-73
AB  - The prevalence of Salmonella isolated from a poultry farm and from the poultry
      processing plant environment were evaluated from August 2004 to July 2005 along
      with microbial antibiotic resistance. In total, 3242 samples were collected from 
      the farm and processing plant. Samples collected from the farm included hatching 
      eggs, paper liners, litter, feed, water, drinkers, air, bird rinse, and ceca.
      While samples collected from the processing plant included carcass rinse and
      ceca. Out of 2882 samples collected from the farm, the overall percentage
      prevalence of Salmonella was 5.4% with prevalence rates of 10%, 1.5%, 0.7%, 0.2%,
      13.5%, and 12.6% for hatching eggs, litter, feed, drinkers, bird rinse and ceca, 
      respectively. No Salmonella were detected in any of the paper liner, water, or
      air samples. Out of 360 samples collected from the processing plant, the overall 
      percentage prevalence of Salmonella was 4.7% with prevalence rates of 6.1% and
      3.3% for carcass rinse and ceca samples, respectively. Salmonella Enteritidis was
      the most prevalent serotype. All of the isolates were resistant to at least one
      antibiotic and 10 different resistance profiles were found among 173 isolates of 
      Salmonella Enteritidis. Resistance to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and
      tetracycline were the most common. The widespread occurrence of multiple
      resistant Salmonella Enteritidis is a cause for concern, and local regulatory
      enforcement agencies should ensure prudent use of antibiotics.

TI  - Relative susceptibility of airway organisms to antimicrobial effects of nitric
      oxide.
PG  - 770-776
LID - 10.1002/alr.21966 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is released in the airway as a critical component
      of innate immune defense against invading pathogenic organisms. It is well
      documented that bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of NO are
      concentration-dependent. However, few data exist comparing relative
      susceptibility of common pathogens to NO at physiologic concentrations. In this
      study we evaluated the effects of NO on 4 common airway bacteria and 1 fungus,
      and examined the potential implications of discrepancies in sensitivity. METHODS:
      Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans cultures were adjusted to a uniform 
      optical density (OD) and grown in log phase at 37 degrees C with varying
      concentrations of NO formed by DETA NONOate. Both OD readings and colony forming 
      units (CFUs) were measured at varying time-points to evaluate for inhibitory
      effects of NO. RESULTS: P aeruginosa and C albicans were significantly more
      sensitive to NO at physiologic concentrations typical of the human airway. S
      aureus was attenuated by NO to a lesser degree, and K pneumoniae and S epidermis 
      were more resistant to NO at all concentrations tested. Air surface liquid from
      cultured human sinonasal epithelial cells had an additive effect in bacterial
      killing of P aeruginosa, but not in S aureus. CONCLUSION: Common airway pathogens
      have varying levels of susceptibility to NO at physiologic concentrations of
      innate immune defense. Relative sensitivity of P aeruginosa and relative
      resistance of S epidermis may help explain the composition of the healthy
      microbiome, as well as opportunistic infection in the absence of induced NO
      release.

TI  - Disk diffusion susceptibility testing of Branhamella catarrhalis with ampicillin 
      and seven other antimicrobial agents.
PG  - 1519-23
AB  - A total of 74 clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis were characterized
      with respect to their ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalothin, cefaclor,
      erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
      MICs and zones of inhibition. Disk diffusion tests were performed according to
      the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards with
      two different media (Mueller-Hinton agar and chocolate Mueller-Hinton agar) and
      plates incubated under two atmospheric conditions (ambient air and 5 to 7% CO2). 
      Optimum disk diffusion test results were obtained with Mueller-Hinton agar plates
      incubated in ambient air with all eight antimicrobial agents. On the basis of
      comparisons of MICs versus zones of inhibition, the following zone diameter
      interpretive criteria were defined for testing B. catarrhalis with disks
      containing 10 micrograms of ampicillin: greater than or equal to 38 mm,
      susceptible; 20 to 37 mm, moderately susceptible; less than or equal to 19 mm,
      resistant. The respective MIC correlates were less than or equal to 0.06, 0.125
      to 0.5, and greater than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Because of the absence of
      frankly resistant test organisms, it was not possible to make definitive
      recommendations pertaining to disk diffusion tests with amoxicillin-clavulanate, 
      cephalothin, cefaclor, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Evidence is presented, however, which suggests
      that the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards disk
      diffusion interpretive criteria for nonfastidious bacteria can be applied to B.
      catarrhalis, at least as they pertain to the susceptible category with
      cephalothin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, tetracycline,
      chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. With cefaclor, a zone
      diameter of greater than or equal to 21 mm was determined to adequately define
      the susceptible category.

TI  - Activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and its components against Haemophilus
      influenzae.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin antibiotic that is
      constituted in a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of the two components. Quinupristin and
      dalfopristin are thought to act synergically by binding to two separate sites on 
      the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. The in-vitro activities of the two
      components separately and together in different ratios were determined for a
      collection of 100 Haemophilus influenzae strains representing various
      antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The NCCLS microdilution susceptibility
      testing procedure incorporating Haemophilus test medium (HTM) broth was used to
      determine MICs of quinupristin, dalfopristin and seven other antimicrobial
      agents. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 4 and 8, 4 and 16, and 64 and 128 mg/L
      for quinupristin/dalfopristin (30:70), dalfopristin and quinupristin,
      respectively. MICs of quinupristin and dalfopristin were also determined in
      Mueller-Hinton lysed horse blood broth and by HTM agar dilution testing. Compared
      with HTM broth-derived results, the MICs of quinupristin/dalfopristin and its
      components were the same or one dilution higher in lysed horse blood and HTM agar
      incubated in air, and were equivalent or one dilution lower in HTM agar incubated
      in a CO2 atmosphere. The MICs of quinupristin and dalfopristin separately or
      together were directly proportional to erythromycin MICs, but were otherwise
      unaffected by any of the resistance mechanisms represented in these strains. MICs
      of quinupristin and dalfopristin combined in ratios of 10:90, 70:30 and 90:10 did
      not differ significantly from those of the 30:70 ratio. Thus, unlike the synergic
      activity noted against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of
      quinupristin/dalfopristin against H. influenzae appears to be due almost entirely
      to the dalfopristin component of the combination.

PG  - 990-7
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in our hospital
      between 1986 and 1989 were mainly examined for their susceptibility to various
      antibiotics and coagulase types. The isolation frequency of MRSA among S. aureus 
      isolated from clinical specimens has been steadily increasing; 37.8% in 1986,
      49.8% in 1987, 60.6% in 1988 and 63.2% in 1989. This trend was particularly
      noticeable in the specimens associated with the respiratory tracts. The isolation
      rate of MRSA in the surgery and pediatrics wards was higher than that in the
      internal medicine ward. More than 80% of MRSA were coagulase type II, which were 
      multi-resistant to penicillins, cephems, aminoglycosides and macrolides, and
      sensitive to MINO, new quinolones and VCM. These epidemic strains were also
      isolated from the nose of medical staff and from air samples in the wards. These 
      findings suggest that the hospital environment including the patients and
      hospital personnel is extensively contaminated with multi-resistant MRSA of
      coagulase type II. Measures should be taken for prevention and control of
      nosocomial infection with MRSA in the whole hospital.

TI  - Reported cholera in the United States, 1992-1994: a reflection of global changes 
      in cholera epidemiology.
PG  - 307-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe US cholera surveillance data from 1992 to 1994 and the
      domestic impact of the epidemics of Vibrio cholerae O1 in Latin America and V
      cholerae O139 in Asia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of
      surveillance data from all cases of cholera reported to the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1994, in 
      the United States and its territories. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical,
      epidemiologic, and laboratory surveillance data. RESULTS: From 1992 through 1994,
      160 cases of cholera were reported to CDC by 20 states and 1 territory. This is a
      marked increase: only 136 cases were reported from 1965 through 1991. Outbreaks
      affecting 75 passengers on an airplane from Latin America and 5 passengers on a
      cruise ship in Southeast Asia accounted for 50 percent of cases. Vibrio cholerae 
      O139 caused 6 cases (4 percent). The proportion of V cholerae O1 isolates
      resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent rose from 3 percent in 1992 to 93
      percent in 1994. Of 158 patients whose location of exposure was known, 151 (96
      percent) acquired infection abroad (125 in Latin America, 26 in Asia). Of 105
      persons whose reason for travel was known, 31 (30 percent) were US residents who 
      had returned to their country of origin to visit family or friends, and 65 (62
      percent) were non-US residents visiting the United States from cholera-affected
      countries. The cholera rate among persons arriving in the United States from
      cholera-affected regions was 0.27 case per 100000 air travelers, not
      substantially increased from earlier estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Cholera has
      increased in the United States since 1991, reflecting global changes in cholera
      epidemiology, and is now primarily travel associated and antimicrobial resistant.
      Most travelers were not traditional tourists; reaching them with prevention
      measures may be difficult. The risk of cholera to the individual traveler remains
      extremely low.

      Air Filtration.
PG  - 22846-22855
LID - 10.1021/acsami.7b05796 [doi]
AB  - Development of high-performance nanomaterials with not only strong ability to
      trap the pollutants but also good structure stability under varying environmental
      conditions is a critical need for air-filtration applications. However, it has
      been very challenging for a filtering material to simultaneously realize
      multifunctional air filtration and good environmental stability. Here, based on
      our previous studies on protein-based nanofilters, we report a cross-linked
      protein nanofabric to address this challenging issue. It is found that
      cross-linked protein nanofabrics can significantly improve the structure
      stability against different moisture levels and temperatures, while maintaining
      the multifunctional filtration performance. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the
      cross-linked protein nanomaterials also possess antibacterial properties, such as
      Shewanella oneidensis bacteria, further improving the environmental stability.
      The effects of cross-linking with different loadings of cross-linking agent on
      the structure stability and filtration performance are further investigated at
      different humidity levels and temperatures. This study provides a cost-effective 
      solution for advanced "green" nanomaterials with excellent performance in both
      filtration functions and structure stability under varying environment.

TI  - Environmental health impacts of concentrated animal feeding operations:
      anticipating hazards--searching for solutions.
PG  - 296-7
AB  - A scientific conference and workshop was held March 2004 in Iowa City, Iowa, that
      brought together environmental scientists from North America and Europe to
      address major environmental health issues associated with concentrated animal
      feeding operations (CAFOs) in large, industrialized livestock production
      facilities. After one and a half days of plenary sessions, five expert workgroups
      convened to consider the most relevant research areas, including respiratory
      health effects, modeling and monitoring of air toxics, water quality issues,
      influenza pandemics and antibiotic resistance, and community health and
      socioeconomic issues. The workgroup reports that follow outline the state of the 
      science and public health concerns relating to livestock production as they apply
      to each workgroup topic. The reports also identify areas in which further
      research is needed and suggest opportunities to translate science to policy
      initiatives that would effect improvements in public and environmental health.
      Viable solutions to some of the current environmental health problems associated 
      with CAFOs are outlined. In addition, these reports bring to light several major 
      concerns, including air and water contamination, the rise of antibiotic-resistant
      bacteria in livestock, and the specter of influenza outbreaks arising from siting
      industrialized poultry and swine production in proximity to each other and to
      humans.

AB  - Residual wastewater solids are a significant reservoir of antibiotic resistance
      genes (ARGs). While treatment technologies can reduce ARG levels in residual
      wastewater solids, the effects of these technologies on ARGs in soil during
      subsequent land-application are unknown. In this study we investigated the use of
      numerous treatment technologies (air drying, aerobic digestion, mesophilic
      anaerobic digestion, thermophilic anaerobic digestion, pasteurization, and
      alkaline stabilization) on the fate of ARGs and class 1 integrons in wastewater
      solids-amended soil microcosms. Six ARGs [erm(B), qnrA, sul1, tet(A), tet(W), and
      tet(X)], the integrase gene of class 1 integrons (intI1), and 16S rRNA genes were
      quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The quantities of ARGs
      and intI1 decreased in all microcosms, but thermophilic anaerobic digestion,
      alkaline stabilization, and pasteurization led to the most extensive decay of
      ARGs and intI1, often to levels similar to that of the control microcosms to
      which no wastewater solids had been applied. In contrast, the rates by which ARGs
      and intI1 declined using the other treatment technologies were generally similar,
      typically varying by less than 2 fold. These results demonstrate that wastewater 
      solids treatment technologies can be used to decrease the persistence of ARGs and
      intI1 during their subsequent application to soil.

AB  - The human respiratory tract is exposed daily to airborne fungi, fungal enzymes,
      and secondary metabolites. The endemic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides
      spp, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and
      occasionally Aspergillus fumigatus, are primary pulmonary pathogens of otherwise 
      healthy people. Such infections resolve in most people, and only a few infections
      lead to disease. However, many fungi are directly allergenic by colonising the
      respiratory tract or indirectly through contact with cell wall constituents and
      proteases, causing or exacerbating allergic disease. Increasing evidence
      implicates high indoor fungal exposures as a precipitant of asthma in children
      and in worsening asthma symptoms. Lung or airways infection by endemic fungi or
      aspergillus can be diagnosed with respiratory sample culture or serum IgG
      testing. Sputum, induced sputum, or bronchial specimens are all suitable
      specimens for detecting fungi; microscopy, fungal culture, galactomannan antigen,
      and aspergillus PCR are useful tests. Antifungal treatment is indicated in almost
      all patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary infections, chronic invasive and
      granulomatous rhinosinusitis, and aspergillus bronchitis. Most patients with
      fungal asthma benefit from antifungal therapy. Adverse reactions to oral azoles, 
      drug interactions, and azole resistance in Aspergillus spp limit therapy.
      Environmental exposures, genetic factors, and structural pulmonary risk factors
      probably underlie disease but are poorly understood.

AB  - The world is facing more deaths due to increasing antibiotic-resistant bacterial 
      infections and the shortage of new highly effective antibiotics, however the air 
      media as its important transmission route has not been adequately studied. Based 
      on the latest literature acquired in this work, we have discussed the
      state-of-the-art research progress of the concentration, distribution and spread 
      of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 
      different environmental air media, and also analyzed some future prevention and
      control measures. The large use of antibiotics in the medical settings and animal
      husbandry places has resulted in higher abundances of ARB and ARGs in the
      relevant and surrounding atmosphere than in urban and general indoor air
      environments. ARGs can be spread by adhering to airborne particles, and
      researchers have also found that air media contain more abundant ARGs than other 
      environmental media such as soil, water and sediment. It was suggested in this
      review that strengthening the monitoring, study on spreading factors and
      biological toxicity, and also research and development on pathogen accurate
      diagnosis and new green antibiotic are expected to help effectively monitor,
      prevent and control of the impacts of airborne resistant bacteria and resistance 
      genes on both human and ecologies.

AB  - Five hundred and twenty seven strains of Staphylococcus aureus with massive
      contamination of at least 10(3) when estimated quantitatively were tested for
      their sensitivity to antibiotics and chloramine B. The staphylococcal strains
      were isolated from patients, air and stock of rooms in medical institutions, from
      medical personnel and healthy persons having no long-term contacts with hospital 
      media i. e. from pregnant women and workers of confectionery plants. Among the
      isolates there were strains simultaneously sensitive to antibiotics and
      chloramine B (16.6 per cent), sensitive to antibiotics but resistant to
      chloramine B (5.5 per cent), resistant to antibiotics but sensitive to chloramine
      B (63.1 per cent) and resistant to antibiotics and chloramine B (15.3 per cent). 
      Staphylococci resistant simultaneously to antibiotics and chloramine B were
      isolated from the persons of all the groups and from the air and stock of the
      rooms in the medical institutions. This showed the necessity of controlling
      sensitivity or staphylococci circulating in hospital media not only to
      antibiotics but also to disinfectants for providing more efficient prophylaxis of
      intrahospital infections.

      Karachi: A new dimension to health hazard.
PG  - 901-906
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of pathogenic fungal strains in areas where 
      pigeons are present in a large number. METHODS: This study was conducted at the
      Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, from February
      2015 to March2016, and comprised samples of soil contaminated with pigeons'
      excreta. The samples were collected from 20 different pigeon-feeding places in
      the city. These samples were processed for the isolation and identification of
      fungi by using standard conventional methods. The fungal strains isolated were
      also tested for their susceptibility to commonly used antifungal agents by disc
      diffusion technique. RESULTS: There were 105 samples. A wide variety of fungal
      strains belonging to different genera of Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Penicillium,
      Fusarium and Candida were isolated and identified by using conventional methods. 
      The antifungal resistance pattern of these strains also depicts emergence of
      resistance against commonly used antifungal agents such as amphotericin B and
      fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: The soil and air of places densely populated with
      pigeons were found to be loaded with fungal spores and many of them were
      potential pathogens.

AB  - During the last years, the interest in combining the features of metal-containing
      molecules with biomolecules, particularly peptides, has been increased. Large
      series of new innovative organometallic compounds, as well as potent coordination
      complexes have been designed and, especially in medicinal chemistry, the library 
      of bioactive compounds was excessively expanded by the introduction of metal
      complexes. The research foci are divers and not limited to e.g. the development
      of therapeutics with anti-proliferative or antibacterial activity, or the design 
      of novel biosensors useful for pharmaceutical applications. By introduction of a 
      metal centre, new attributes might be added that could help to overcome the
      problems of difficult to treat diseases, as well as to combat issues with arising
      drug resistances. However, the application of a number of very potent metal
      complexes is restricted owing to their poor water-solubility, air-stability and
      only poor uptake when in contact with cells. In this context, one possibility to 
      optimize promising lead structures is to couple them to bioactive peptides.
      Within this review, an overview on metal complex-peptide conjugates used for drug
      design and future pharmaceutical application is presented.

TI  - Self-Assembled Nanomedicines for Anticancer and Antibacterial Applications.
PG  - e1800670
LID - 10.1002/adhm.201800670 [doi]
AB  - Self-assembly strategies have been widely applied in the nanomedicine field,
      which provide a convenient approach for building various structures for delivery 
      carriers. When cooperating with biomolecules, self-assembly systems have
      significant influence on the cell activity and life process and could be used for
      regulating nanodrug activity. In this review, self-assembled nanomedicines are
      introduced, including materials, encapsulation, and releasing strategies, where
      self-assembly strategies are involved. Furthermore, as a promising and emerging
      area for nanomedicine, in situ self-assembly of anticancer drugs and
      supramolecular antibiotic switches is also discussed about how to regulate drug
      activity. Selective pericellular assembly can block mass transformation of cancer
      cells inducing cell apoptosis, and the intracellular assembly can either cause
      cell death or effectively avoid drug elimination from cytosol of cancer cells
      because of the assembly-induced retention (AIR) effect. Host-guest interactions
      of drug and competitive molecules offer reversible regulations of antibiotic
      activity, which can reduce drug-resistance and inhibit the generation of
      drug-resistant bacteria. Finally, the challenges and development trend in the
      field are discussed.

TI  - Infection Prophylaxis for Breast Implant Surgery: Could We Do Better?
PG  - e19
AB  - Objective: Infective complications following breast implant surgery may result in
      implant removal. This causes patient distress and is costly to treat. A range of 
      precautions is undertaken at the time of surgery to reduce infection, with
      varying levels of supporting evidence. This study aimed to determine how
      frequently and consistently infection prevention precautions are used during
      breast implant surgery. Methods: Multicenter observational study of surgical
      practice with real-time data collection during breast implant surgery. Results:
      From 7 NHS breast units, 121 implant procedures were assessed in 94 patients
      under the care of 22 consultant surgeons. The commonest procedure was immediate
      reconstruction (58%; 70/121). All patients were methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (but not methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus)
      screened. Antibiotics were given at surgery in all cases; 92% (85/94) received
      postoperative antibiotics. Other precautions included closed glove technique
      (67%; 63/94), door signs to reduce theater traffic (72%; 68/94), glove changing
      prior to implant handling (98%; 119/121), laminar air flow theaters (55%; 52/94),
      disposable drapes (94%; 88/94) and gowns (74%; 70/94), and cavity washing (89%;
      108/121). Among the 14 consultants evaluated on more than 1 procedure (range,
      2-22; median = 5), only 1 consistently used exactly the same precautions when
      siting an implant. Conclusion: Despite national guidance, infection prevention
      measures are not applied consistently during breast implant surgery, with
      variability between surgeons and within individual surgeon's practice. The
      introduction of an infection prevention checklist for all breast implant
      procedures could improve the reliability with which these precautions are
      undertaken.

AB  - Aims & Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate genetic relatedness,
      antibiotic resistance pattern, and virulence characteristics of different types
      of S. aureus isolated from air, surfaces, staff, and patients in a Public
      hospital in Ilam. Methods & Materials: A total of 88 of 140 staphylococci
      identified as S. aureus by conventional and molecular methods were used in this
      study. Isolate samples were obtained from surfaces, staff, patients, and hospital
      indoor air. The sampling from staff and surfaces was done through using swab and 
      air by standard pump. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and presence different
      resistant and virulence determinants was assessed. Isolates were then typed by
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and SCCmec typing methods. Results: Out
      of 88isolates, 36 of them (40.9%) were MRSA. Among MRSA isolates, the range of
      resistance to antibiotic was 0% in vancomycin to 83.3% in gentamycin. The most
      prevalent resistant genes among gentamicin resistant S. aureus were acc (6')/aph 
      (2")Ia and aph(3")IIIa. The most common erythromycin resistant gene was ermC.
      Surprisingly, SCCmec types I (30.5%), II (25%)were highly distributed. PFGE
      analysis showed 33 different pulsotypes. Conclusion: This study confirms that
      different isolates of MSSA and MRSA circulate in Ilam which differ in
      antimicrobial susceptibility, content of resistance, and virulence determinants.

TI  - Mechanistic Basis for Obesity-related Increases in Ozone-induced Airway
      Hyperresponsiveness in Mice.
PG  - S357-S362
LID - 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201702-140AW [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a risk factor for asthma, especially nonallergic asthma. Ozone, a
      common air pollutant, is a nonallergic asthma trigger. Importantly, ozone-induced
      decrements in lung function are greater in obese and overweight human subjects
      than in lean individuals. Obese mice also exhibit exaggerated pulmonary responses
      to ozone. Ozone causes greater increases in pulmonary resistance, in
      bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils, and in airway hyperresponsiveness in obese
      than in lean mice. Our data indicate that IL-33 plays a role in mediating these
      events. Ozone causes greater release of IL-33 into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
      in obese than in lean mice. Furthermore, an antibody blocking the IL-33 receptor,
      ST2, attenuates ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in obese but not in lean
      mice. Our data also indicate a complex role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
      in obesity-related effects on the response to ozone. In obese mice, genetic
      deficiency in either TNF-alpha or TNF-alpha receptor 2 augments ozone-induced
      airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas TNF-alpha receptor 2 deficiency virtually
      abolishes ozone-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in lean mice. Finally, obesity
      is known to alter the gut microbiome. In female mice, antibiotics attenuate
      obesity-related increases in the effect of ozone on airway hyperresponsiveness,
      possibly by altering microbial production of short-chain fatty acids. Asthma
      control is often difficult to achieve in obese patients with asthma. Our data
      suggest that therapeutics directed against IL-33 may ultimately prove effective
      in these patients. The data also suggest that dietary manipulations and other
      strategies (prebiotics, probiotics) that alter the microbiome and/or its
      metabolic products may represent a new frontier for treating asthma in obese
      individuals.

      Inhibit Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli on Refrigerated Vacuum-Aged Beef.
PG  - 8070515
LID - 10.1155/2017/8070515 [doi]
AB  - Because of their antagonistic activity towards pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, 
      some members of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been evaluated for use as
      food biopreservatives. The objectives of this study were to assess the
      antimicrobial utility of a commercial LAB intervention against O157 and non-O157 
      Shiga-toxigenic E. coli (STEC) on intact beef strip loins during refrigerated
      vacuum aging and determine intervention efficacy as a function of mode of
      intervention application. Prerigor strip loins were inoculated with a cocktail
      (8.9 +/- 0.1 log10 CFU/ml) of rifampicin-resistant (100.0 mug/ml; Rif(R)) O157
      and non-O157 STEC. Inoculated loins were chilled to </=4 degrees C and treated
      with 8.7 +/- 0.1 log10 CFU/ml LAB intervention using either a pressurized tank
      air sprayer (conventional application) or air-assisted electrostatic sprayer
      (ESS). Surviving STEC were enumerated on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 100.0
      mug/ml rifampicin (TSAR) to determine STEC inhibition as a function of
      intervention application method (conventional, ESS) and refrigerated aging period
      (14, 28 days). Intervention application reduced STEC by 0.4 log10 CFU/cm(2) (p < 
      0.05), although application method did not impact STEC reductions (p > 0.05).
      Data indicate that the LAB biopreservative may assist beef safety protection when
      utilized within a multi-intervention beef harvest, fabrication, and aging
      process.

      Milk Cheese: Biotechnological and Safety Aspects.
PG  - 368-380
LID - 10.17113/ftb.55.03.17.5118 [doi]
AB  - In this study, prevalence, biotechnological and safety profiles of 588
      Enterococcus isolates isolated from raw milk and Istrian cheese during different 
      stages of ripening were analyzed. Despite the low and variable presence of
      enterococci in milk ((3.65+/-2.93) log CFU/mL), highly comparable enterococcal
      populations were established after 30 days of cheese ripening ((7.96+/-0.80) log 
      CFU/g), confirming Enterococcus spp. as a major part of the core microbiota of
      Istrian cheese. The dominant species were E. faecium (53.8%) and E. faecalis
      (42.4%), while minor groups, consisting of E. durans (2.84%) and E. casseliflavus
      (0.95%), also occurred. A pronounced intraspecies variability was noticed based
      on molecular fingerprinting, with 35 strains (genotypes) detected. Most of the
      genotypes were farm-specific with one third being shared between the farms. This 
      genotype variability reflected particular differences of Istrian cheese
      production, mainly variable salt concentration, ripening temperature and air
      humidity as well as microclimatic or vegetation conditions. There was
      considerable variation between the strains of the same species regarding wide
      range of biotechnologically important traits as well as their ability to survive 
      in simulated gastrointestinal conditions. A considerable number of strains were
      resistant to critically important antibiotics such as tetracycline (43.56%),
      erythromycin (35.79%) and vancomycin (23.48%). Polymerase chain reaction-based
      detection did not identify any of the common genetic determinants for vancomycin 
      and erythromycin resistance; for tetracycline tetM gene was detected. The
      presence of virulence genes including agg, efaAfs, gelE, cylM, cylB, cylA, esp,
      efaAfm, cob and cpd was frequently recorded, especially among E. faecalis
      strains.

AB  - Clinically relevant antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance
      genes (ARGs) in bioaerosols have become a greater threat to public health.
      However, few reports have shown that ARB and ARGs were found in the atmosphere.
      High-throughput sequencing applied to environmental sciences has enhanced the
      exploration of microbial populations in atmospheric samples. Thus, five
      nosocomial bioaerosols were collected, and the dominant microbial and pathogenic 
      microorganisms were identified by high-throughput sequencing in this study. The
      results suggested that the dominant microorganisms at the genus level were
      Massilia, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Methylophilus, Micrococcineae, and
      Corynebacterineae. The most abundant pathogenic microorganisms were
      Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Streptococcus
      pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Arcobacter butzleri, Aeromonas veronii, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. The relationship between microbial communities
      and environmental factors was evaluated with canonical correspondence analysis
      (CCA). Meanwhile, differences in the pathogenic bacteria between bioaerosols and 
      dust in a typical hospital was investigated. Furthermore, cultivable
      Staphylococcus isolates with multi-drug resistance phenotype (>3 antibiotics) in 
      the inpatient departments were much higher than those in the transfusion area and
      out-patient departments, possibly attributed to the dense usage of antibiotics in
      inpatient departments. The results of this study might be helpful for
      scientifically air quality control in hospitals.

AB  - Occupational exposure to swine has been associated with increased Staphylococcus 
      aureus carriage, including antimicrobial-resistant strains, and increased risk of
      infections. To characterize animal and environmental routes of worker exposure,
      we optimized methods to identify S. aureus on operations that raise swine in
      confinement with antibiotics (industrial hog operation: IHO) versus on pasture
      without antibiotics (antibiotic-free hog operation: AFHO). We associated findings
      from tested swine and environmental samples with those from personal inhalable
      air samplers on worker surrogates at one IHO and three AFHOs in North Carolina
      using a new One Health approach. We determined swine S. aureus carriage status by
      collecting swab samples from multiple anatomical sites, and we determined
      environmental positivity for airborne bioaerosols with inhalable and impinger
      samplers and a single-stage impactor (ambient air) cross-sectionally. All samples
      were analyzed for S. aureus, and isolates were tested for antimicrobial
      susceptibility, absence of scn (livestock marker), and spa type. Seventeen of
      twenty (85%) swine sampled at the one IHO carried S. aureus at >1 anatomical
      sites compared to none of 30 (0%) swine sampled at the three AFHOs. All S. aureus
      isolates recovered from IHO swine and air samples were scn negative and spa type 
      t337; almost all isolates (62/63) were multidrug resistant. S. aureus was
      recovered from eight of 14 (67%) ambient air and two (100%) worker surrogate
      personal air samples at the one IHO, whereas no S. aureus isolates were recovered
      from 19 ambient and six personal air samples at the three AFHOs. Personal worker 
      surrogate inhalable sample findings were consistent with both swine and ambient
      air data, indicating the potential for workplace exposure. IHO swine and the one 
      IHO environment could be a source of potential pathogen exposure to workers, as
      supported by the detection of multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) with
      livestock-associated spa type t337 among swine, worker surrogate personal air
      samplers and environmental air samples at the one IHO but none of the three AFHOs
      sampled in this study. Concurrent sampling of swine, personal swine worker
      surrogate air, and ambient airborne dust demonstrated that IHO workers may be
      exposed through both direct (animal contact) and indirect (airborne) routes of
      transmission. Investigation of the effectiveness of contact and respiratory
      protections is warranted to prevent IHO worker exposure to multidrug-resistant
      livestock-associated S. aureus and other pathogens.

AB  - Aspergillus terreus is the fourth leading cause of invasive and non-invasive
      aspergillosis and one of the causative agents of morbidity and mortality among
      immunocompromised and high-risk patients. A. terreus appears to have increased as
      a cause of opportunistic fungal infections from superficial to serious invasive
      infections. Although, invasive aspergillosis is often treated empirically with
      amphotericin B, most A. terreus isolates are resistant both in vivo and in vitro 
      to some antifungal drugs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate antifungals
      susceptibility profiles of the different strains of A. terreus against
      amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and
      luliconazole. Forty A. terreus strains originating from environmental sources
      (air and soil) were identified using by macroscopic and microscopic features. Six
      antifungals including, amphotericin B, caspofungin, fluconazole, voriconazole,
      posaconazole and luliconazole were applied for susceptibility tests. Our results 
      show that tested isolates had different susceptibility to antifungals. The lowest
      MICGM related to luliconazole (0.00236mug/ml), followed by posaconazole
      (0.18621mug/ml), voriconazole (0.22925mug/ml), caspofungin (0.86mug/ml),
      fluconazole (8mug/ml) and amphotericin B (11.12mug/ml). This study demonstrated
      that luliconazole had an excellent in vitro activity against all tested isolates 
      of A. terreus, with MICGM 0.00236mug/mL than other tested antifungals. As a
      result, luliconazole could be a possible alternative antifungal for the treatment
      of aspergillosis due to A. terreus.

AB  - Sepsis in children is a complex syndrome that develops from various infections
      and results in 15-30% mortality in high-income countries and up to 50% or higher 
      in low-income countries. Worldwide, this represents an annual burden of 30
      million cases resulting in 8 million deaths. Not surprisingly, there is a
      significantly higher burden in low-income countries with children there being 18 
      times more likely to die before the age of 5 years compared to high-income
      countries. Factors such as commercial air travel, climate change, and unchecked
      population growth have contributed to the growing burden of infectious diseases
      and ensuing sepsis. In this article, we review the important role of global
      advocacy to improve public awareness of sepsis; increase access to essential
      medicines and vaccines; improve use of evidence-based treatment guidelines; raise
      awareness of antimicrobial resistance and encourage antibiotic stewardship; and, 
      develop resilient health systems that can cope with health crises. Advocacy in
      these areas can assist nations in reaching the United Nations sustainable
      development goals (UN SDGs) of low rates of neonatal and under-5 mortality.

TI  - Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus in sawmills of Eastern France.
LID - 10.1111/jam.13488 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Emergence of azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus complicates management
      of Aspergillus diseases. Currently, selection pressure caused by azole fungicide 
      use in farming is strongly suspected of creating resistance. As sawmills also use
      azole fungicides, we investigated the presence of azole-resistant strains in this
      environment and studied the relationship between azole fungicide use and
      development of resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Air (n = 200) and substrate (n = 
      600) samples were taken in 20 sawmills. Azole-resistant strains (Etest and EUCAST
      methods) were confirmed by sequencing the cyp51A gene and its promoters. Dosage
      of propiconazole and tebuconazole was performed by gas chromatography coupled
      with mass spectrometry. Twenty-four azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains were
      collected among 20 of the 600 substrate samples (3%). Eighty-three percent of
      theses strains had TR34 /L98H mutation. A significantly higher number of
      resistant strains was collected in sawmills using fungicide products made with
      propiconazole mixed with a high concentration of tebuconazole (P = 0.009). The
      presence of resistant strains was significantly linked to propiconazole
      quantities in substrates (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of azole-resistant 
      A. fumigatus carrying TR34 /L98H mutation seems to greatly depend on the azole
      fungicide formulation and quantities of azole. These preliminary results are
      valuable to propose new approaches limiting the emergence of azole-resistant
      strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Azole resistance is an emerging
      problem in A. fumigatus and threatens clinical advances made possible by the use 
      of azole antifungals in the treatment of Aspergillus-related diseases. Azole
      fungicides are also used in the wood industry, notably in sawmills, to protect
      wood from wood-destroying fungi. Through our study, we show that sawmills
      represent another professional environment affected by the presence of
      azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains carrying the TR34 /L98H mutation. Moreover, 
      this study provides valuable preliminary results to propose some new approaches
      to limit the emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus strains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of biofilms to clinical practice is being increasingly
      realized. Biofilm tolerance to antibiotics is well described but limited work has
      been conducted on the efficacy of heat disinfection and sterilization against
      biofilms. AIM: To test the susceptibility of planktonic, hydrated biofilm and
      dry-surface biofilm forms of Staphylococcus aureus, to dry-heat and wet-heat
      treatments. METHODS: S. aureus was grown as both hydrated biofilm and dry-surface
      biofilm in the CDC biofilm generator. Biofilm was subjected to a range of
      temperatures in a hot-air oven (dry heat), water bath or autoclave (wet heat).
      FINDINGS: Dry-surface biofilms remained culture positive even when treated with
      the harshest dry-heat condition of 100 degrees C for 60min. Following autoclaving
      samples were culture negative but 62-74% of bacteria in dry-surface biofilms
      remained alive as demonstrated by live/dead staining and confocal microscopy.
      Dry-surface biofilms subjected to autoclaving at 121 degrees C for up to 30min
      recovered and released planktonic cells. Recovery did not occur following
      autoclaving for longer or at 134 degrees C, at least during the time-period
      tested. Hydrated biofilm recovered following dry-heat treatment up to 100 degrees
      C for 10min but failed to recover following autoclaving despite the presence of
      43-60% live cells as demonstrated by live/dead staining. CONCLUSION: S. aureus
      dry-surface biofilms are less susceptible to killing by dry heat and steam
      autoclaving than hydrated biofilms, which are less susceptible to heat treatment 
      than planktonic suspensions.

TI  - Fitting the message to the location: engaging adults with antimicrobial
      resistance in a World War 2 air raid shelter.
LID - 10.1111/jam.13937 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: There are many different initiatives, global and local, designed to raise
      awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and change audience behaviour.
      However, it is not possible to assess the impact of specific, small-scale events 
      on national and international outcomes-although one might acknowledge some
      contribution to the individual and collective knowledge and experience-focused
      'science capital' As with any research, in preparation for a public engagement
      event, it is important to identify aims, and appropriate methods whose results
      might help satisfy those aims. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to develop,
      deliver and evaluate an event designed to engage an adult audience with AMR.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: The venue was a World War 2 air raid shelter, enabling
      comparison of the pre- and postantibiotic eras via three different activity
      stations, focusing on nursing, the search for new antibiotics and investigations 
      into novel antimicrobials. The use of observers released the presenters from
      evaluation duties, enabling them to focus on their specific activities.
      Qualitative measures of audience engagement were combined with quantitative data.
      CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation revealed that adult audiences can easily be absorbed 
      into an activity-particularly if hands-on-after a brief introduction.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This research demonstrates that hands-on
      practical engagement with AMR can enable high-level interaction and learning in
      an informal and enjoyable environment.

TI  - Bordetella pertussis Adenylate Cyclase Toxin Disrupts Functional Integrity of
      Bronchial Epithelial Layers.
LID - e00445-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00445-17 [doi]
AB  - The airway epithelium restricts the penetration of inhaled pathogens into the
      underlying tissue and plays a crucial role in the innate immune defense against
      respiratory infections. The whooping cough agent, Bordetella pertussis, adheres
      to ciliated cells of the human airway epithelium and subverts its defense
      functions through the action of secreted toxins and other virulence factors. We
      examined the impact of B. pertussis infection and of adenylate cyclase
      toxin-hemolysin (CyaA) action on the functional integrity of human bronchial
      epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). B. pertussis
      adhesion to the apical surface of polarized pseudostratified VA10 cell layers
      provoked a disruption of tight junctions and caused a drop in transepithelial
      electrical resistance (TEER). The reduction of TEER depended on the capacity of
      the secreted CyaA toxin to elicit cAMP signaling in epithelial cells through its 
      adenylyl cyclase enzyme activity. Both purified CyaA and cAMP-signaling drugs
      triggered a decrease in the TEER of VA10 cell layers. Toxin-produced cAMP
      signaling caused actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and induced mucin 5AC
      production and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, while it inhibited the
      IL-17A-induced secretion of the IL-8 chemokine and of the antimicrobial peptide
      beta-defensin 2. These results indicate that CyaA toxin activity compromises the 
      barrier and innate immune functions of Bordetella-infected airway epithelia.

AB  - Phagocytic reaction with respect to antibiotic and chloramine B sensitive and
      resistant staphylococci isolated from healthy persons and patients, air and stock
      of medical institutions was studied on albino mice. It was shown that the
      staphylococcal isolates included strains simultaneously sensitive to antibiotics 
      and chloramine, sensitive to antibiotics and resistant to chloramine, resistant
      to antibiotics and sensitive to chloramine and simultaneously resistant to
      antibiotics and chloramine. Activity, intensity and completeness of phagocytosis 
      by leucocytes from mouse abdominal cavity exudates with respect to the
      staphylococcal strains sensitive to antibiotics and resistant to chloramine,
      resistant to antibiotics and sensitive to chloramine and simultaneously resistant
      to antibiotics and chloramine were lower than the values of the phagocytic
      reaction with respect to the isolates simultaneously sensitive to antibiotics and
      chloramine. This suggested that not only antibiotic resistance of microbes but
      also their resistance to disinfectants could be referred to complicating factors 
      of hospital infections.

TI  - Nutrient Composition Promotes Switching between Pellicle and Bottom Biofilm in
      Salmonella.
PG  - 2160
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2017.02160 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella is one of the most frequently reported causes of foodborne illness
      worldwide. Non-typhoidal serovars cause gastroenteritis in humans. Salmonella can
      grow on surfaces forming biofilms, contributing to its persistence since biofilms
      are difficult to eradicate due to the high resistance to antimicrobials and
      disinfectants. It has been described that there are two crucial biofilm promoting
      factors in Salmonella: curli and cellulose. The expression of both factors is
      coordinately regulated by the transcriptional regulator CsgD. Most biofilm
      studies of Salmonella have been performed by growing bacteria in low osmolarity
      rich medium and low temperature (25 degrees C). In such conditions, the biofilm
      is formed at the air-liquid interface (pellicle biofilm). Remarkably, when
      Salmonella grow in minimal medium, biofilm formation switches from the air-liquid
      interface to the solid-liquid interface (bottom biofilm). In this report, the
      switching between pellicle and bottom biofilm has been characterized. Our data
      indicate that curli, but not cellulose, is crucial for the formation of both
      kinds of biofilms. In minimal medium, conditions promoting formation of bottom
      biofilm, a high transcriptional expression of csgD and consequently of the genes 
      involved in the synthesis of curli and cellulose was detected. The nutritional
      status of the cells seems to be pivotal for the spatial distribution of the
      biofilms formed. When bacteria is growing in minimal medium the addition of amino
      acids downregulates the expression of csgB and causes the switch between bottom
      and pellicle biofilm. The crosstalk between general metabolism and biofilm
      formation is also highlighted by the fact that the metabolic sensor cAMP
      modulates the type of biofilm generated by Salmonella. Moreover, cAMP regulates
      transcriptional expression of csgD and stimulates pellicle biofilm formation,
      suggesting that the physiological conditions define the type of biofilm formed by
      Salmonella. The consequences of the switching between pellicle and bottom biofilm
      during either infection or survival in natural environments remain undercover.

TI  - Toxicity, Ozone
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Ozone normally occurs in a gas state as three atoms of oxygen (O) linked in a
      cyclic structure and is a by-product of water purification, bleaching and any
      process generating a spark or electric arc in the presence of oxygen. It is also 
      found in the atmosphere, with higher altitudes containing higher levels of ozone.
      It is found in the stratosphere where it absorbs various ultraviolet radiation.
      Ozone is also an environmental air pollutant along with others such as sulfur
      dioxide and particulate matter. Ozone can react with air and create nitrogen
      dioxide, another air pollutant if it is improperly generated. In spite of this,
      ozone can be generated by medical devices for therapeutic purposes. Potential
      medical applications of ozone therapy have a wide range including 1) limiting
      postoperative pain after dental extraction when used as a gel, 2) repairing inner
      ear damage caused by acoustic trauma, 3) reducing coronary stent restenosis when 
      applied as an auto-hem-transfusion, and 4) enhancing methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus elimination in mediastinitis when used in conjunction with 
      antibiotics. Outside of medicine, ozone has been proposed for use in various
      settings such as in the pretreatment of textile wastewater. While ozone itself
      can cause health troubles, it can also react with chemicals found in a multitude 
      of products to lead to other potentially toxic substances such as formaldehyde.
      Despite proponents for its use and the potential applications, toxicity can occur
      even at environmental levels and may be related to cardiac, respiratory, and
      neurologic events. With the wide range of possible applications and toxicity that
      can occur at environmental levels from within a home, research on ozone use and
      toxicity is likely to increase in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is a fundamental component of infection prevention, but 
      few studies have examined whether hand-drying method affects the risk of
      dissemination of potential pathogens. MATERIALS/METHODS: We performed a
      multicentre, internal-crossover study comparing bacterial contamination levels in
      washrooms with hand-drying by either paper towels (PT) or jet air dryer (JAD,
      Dyson). 120 sampling sessions occurred over 12 weeks in each of 3 hospitals
      (UK/France/Italy). Bacteria were cultured from air, multiple surfaces and dust.
      Washroom footfall (patients/visitors/staff) was monitored externally. RESULTS:
      Footfall was nine times higher in UK washrooms. Bacterial contamination was lower
      in PT vs JAD washrooms; contamination was similar in France/UK, but markedly
      lower in Italy washrooms. Total bacterial recovery was significantly greater from
      JAD versus PT dispenser surfaces at all sites (median 100-300vs0-10 CFU; all
      p<0.0001). In UK/France, significantly more bacteria were recovered from JAD
      washroom floors (median 24vs191 CFU, p<0.00001). UK MSSA recovery was 3x more
      frequent and 6-fold higher for JADs vs PTs surfaces (both p<0.0001). UK MRSA
      recovery was 3x more frequent (21vs7 CFU) from JAD versus PT surfaces or floors. 
      Significantly more enterococci and ESBL-producing bacteria were recovered from UK
      JAD versus PT washroom floors (p<0.0001). In France, ESBL-producing bacteria were
      recovered from dust twice as often during JAD versus PT use. CONCLUSIONS:
      Multiple examples of significant differences in surface bacterial contamination, 
      including by faecal and antibiotic resistant bacteria, were observed, with higher
      levels in JAD versus PT washrooms. Hand-drying method affects the risk of
      (airborne) dissemination of bacteria in real world settings.

TI  - Monitoring of clinical strains and environmental fungal aerocontamination to
      prevent invasive aspergillosis infections in hospital during large deconstruction
      work: a protocol study.
PG  - e018109
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018109 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Monitoring fungal aerocontamination is an essential measure to
      prevent severe invasive aspergillosis (IA) infections in hospitals. One central
      block among 32 blocks of Edouard Herriot Hospital (EHH) was entirely demolished
      in 2015, while care activities continued in surrounding blocks. The main
      objective was to undertake broad environmental monitoring and clinical
      surveillance of IA cases to document fungal dispersion during major
      deconstruction work and to assess clinical risk. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A daily
      environmental survey of fungal loads was conducted in eight wards located near
      the demolition site. Air was collected inside and outside selected wards by agar 
      impact samplers. Daily spore concentrations were monitored continuously by
      volumetric samplers at a flow rate of 10 L.min(-1). Daily temperature, wind
      direction and speed as well as relative humidity were recorded by the French
      meteorological station Meteociel. Aspergillus fumigatus strains stored will be
      genotyped by multiple-locus, variable-number, tandem-repeat analysis. Antifungal 
      susceptibility will be assessed by E-test strips on Roswell Park Memorial
      Institute medium supplemented with agar. Ascertaining the adequacy of current
      environmental monitoring techniques in hospital is of growing importance,
      considering the rising impact of fungal infections and of curative antifungal
      costs. The present study could improve the daily management of IA risk during
      major deconstruction work and generate new data to ameliorate and redefine
      current guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the
      clinical research and ethics committees of EHH.

      genes in Escherichia coli isolated from the environment of horse riding centers.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance profile and
      the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes and to analyze the
      genetic diversity of Escherichia coli strains isolated from the environment of
      horse riding centers. The study was conducted using E. coli strains isolated from
      the air, manure, and horse nostril swabs in three horse riding centers differing 
      in the system of horse keeping-stable (OJK Pegaz and KJK Szary) and free-range
      (SKH Nielepice). Resistance to antibiotics was determined using the
      disk-diffusion method, and the PCR technique was employed to detect the
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes, while the genetic diversity of
      strains was assessed by rep-PCR. A total of 200 strains were collected during the
      2-year study, with the majority isolated from KJK Szary, while the smallest
      number was obtained from SKH Nielepice. The strains were mostly resistant to
      ampicillin, aztreonam, and ticarcillin. The tested strains were most frequently
      resistant to one or two antibiotics, with a maximum of ten antimicrobials at the 
      same time. Two multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were detected in OJK Pegaz while
      in KJK Szary there were two MDR and one extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strain. 
      The ESBL mechanism was most frequently observed in OJK Pegaz (20.31% of strains) 
      followed by KJK Szary (15.53% of strains) and SKH Nielepice (15.15% of strains). 
      Among the ESBL-determining genes, only blaTEM and blaCTXM-9 were detected-blaTEM 
      was mostly found in KJK Szary (53.40% of strains), while the second detected
      gene-blaCTXM-9-was most frequent in SKH Nielepice (6.06% of strains). The rep-PCR
      genotyping showed high variation among the analyzed strains, whereas its degree
      differed between the studied facilities, indicating that the type of horse
      keeping (stable vs. free-range) affects the genetic diversity of the E. coli
      strains. Having regard to the fact that the tested strains of E. coli were
      derived from non-hospitalized horses that were not treated pharmacologically, we 
      can assume that the observed antimicrobial resistance may be of both-natural
      origin, i.e., not the result of the selection pressure, and acquired, the source 
      of which could be people present in the horse riding facilities, the remaining
      horses which were not included in the study, and air, as well as water, fodder,
      and litter of the animals. Therefore, it can be concluded that the studied horses
      are the source of resistant E. coli and it is reasonable to continue monitoring
      the changes in antimicrobial resistance in those bacteria.

TI  - Detection of antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in various hospital
      environments: potential sources for transmission of Acinetobacter infections.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/s12199-017-0653-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of
      the most problematic hospital acquired pathogens around the world. This study was
      designed to investigate the presence of antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in
      various hospital environments. METHODS: Air, water and inanimate surface samples 
      were taken in different wards of four hospitals and analyzed for the presence of 
      A. baumannii. Confirmed A. baumannii isolates were analyzed for antimicrobial
      susceptibility and also screened for the presence of three most common OXA- type 
      carbapenemase-encoding genes. RESULTS: A. baumannii was detected in 11% (7/64) of
      air samples with the highest recovery in intensive care units (ICUs). A.
      baumannii was also detected in 17% (7/42) and 2% (1/42) of surface and water
      samples, respectively. A total of 40 A. baumannii isolates were recovered and
      analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility showed the highest resistance towards
      ceftazidime (92.5%, 37/40). 85% (34/40) and 80% (32/40) of the isolates were also
      resistant to imipenem and gentamicin, respectively. Resistance genes analysis
      showed that 77.5% (31/40) strains contained OXA-23 and 5% (2/40) strains
      contained OXA-24, but OXA-58 was not detected in any of the strains. CONCLUSION: 
      Detection of antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in various samples revealed that
      hospital environments could act as a potential source for transmission of A.
      baumannii infections especially in ICUs. These results emphasize the importance
      of early detection and implementation of control measures to prevent the spread
      of A. baumannii in hospital environments.

PG  - 510-516
LID - 10.13227/j.hjkx.201606162 [doi]
AB  - Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is considered a source of airborne
      human pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes. This study collected fecal
      samples and corresponding air samples from inside and outside atmospheric
      environments of layer and broiler feeding operations. We detected the types of 61
      genes including five classes of antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes (23 genes
      of ampicillin, 23 genes of tetracycline, 5 genes of quinolones, 5 genes of
      sulfonamides and 2 genes of erythromycin), five conditional pathogenic bacteria
      (Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter and Clostridium
      perfringens) and class1 integron. Quantitative real time PCR was used to analyze 
      concentrations of typical genes with relatively high detection rates. The results
      indicated that the detection rates of antibiotic resistance genes were 8,7,2,3
      and 2. At the same time, two kinds of pathogenic bacteria were detected. The
      detection rates of the target genes in the air were lower than those of the fecal
      sample. The total bacterial gene (16S rDNA) concentration in the air of layer and
      broiler was 10(6) copies.m(-3), and that of the other typical genes was about
      10(4)copies.m(-3). And the outdoor concentration was much lower than the indoor
      concentration. The proportions of antibiotic resistance genes and conditional
      pathogenic bacteria in the air were higher than those in the fecal samples and
      the outdoor proportions were lower than the indoor proportions. Preliminary
      results of this study indicated that feces was an important source of antibiotic 
      resistance genes, conditional pathogenic bacteria and class1 integron.
      Aerosolization degrees of genes in feces were different. This study will provide 
      the basic data for both source tracking of antibiotic resistance genes and
      pathogens from CAFOs and risk assessment of pollution of CAFOs in the surrounding
      air environment.

TI  - Biotech innovations in the prevention of respiratory infectious diseases.
PG  - 155-160
AB  - Acute respiratory infections place a huge burden on society in terms of
      disability, premature mortality, and also direct health service costs (drugs
      prescriptions) and the indirect costs related to lost production. Therefore,
      prevention of respiratory infections is an important goal for public health
      interventions. In this context, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) represent an
      interesting perspective for research and development by virtue of their favorable
      antimicrobial activity against many respiratory pathogens. One of the latest
      innovations in the biotech field discussed in this review is the creation of a
      biocompatible, biogel-based nasal filter enriched with AgNPs. Compared to
      traditional personal protective equipment (PPE), this type of nasal filter has
      the advantage of combining the antibacterial and antiviral activity of AgNPs with
      the common filtration capacity shared by other PPEs. This dual mechanism means
      that AgNP-enriched nasal filters serve to reduce the infecting microbial-load and
      protect the lower airways, without interfering with the normal respiratory
      capacity (airflow-resistance <5%). Given their antimicrobial characteristics and 
      performance, AgNP-enriched nasal filters can meet many community and occupational
      currently unmet needs in the prevention of airborne infectious diseases, by
      ensuring an excellent respiratory-comfort and a continuous day-use.

      intranasal delivery of Duox2 DNA using polymer that mediates immunization.

AB  - Respiratory mucosa especially nasal epithelium is well known as the first-line
      barrier of air-borne pathogens. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are 
      detected in in vitro cultured human epithelial cells and in vivo lung. With
      identification of NADPH oxidase (Nox) system of respiratory epithelium, the
      antimicrobial role of ROS has been studied. Duox2 is the most abundant Nox
      isoform and produces the regulated amount of ROS in respiratory epithelium.
      Duox2-derived ROS are involved in antiviral innate immune responses but more
      studies are needed to verify the mechanism. In respiratory epithelium,
      Duox2-derived ROS is critical for recognition of virus through families retinoic 
      acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5
      (MDA5) at the early stage of antiviral innate immune responses. Various secreted 
      interferons (IFNs) play essential roles for antiviral host defense by downstream 
      cell signaling, and transcription of IFN-stimulated genes is started to suppress 
      viral replication. Type I and type III IFNs are verified more responsible for
      influenza A virus (IAV) infection in respiratory epithelium and Duox2 is required
      to regulate IFN-related immune responses. Transient overexpression of Duox2 using
      cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) induces secretion of type I and type III 
      IFNs and significantly attenuated IAV replication in respiratory epithelium.
      Here, we discuss Duox2-mediated antiviral innate immune responses and the role of
      Duox2 as a mucosal vaccine to resist respiratory viral infection.

AB  - Preparation of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells to maintain
      pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is time consuming and involved in animal issues.
      Here, we demonstrated a novel method to prepare feeder cells with high
      efficiency, timesaving, and low costs. MEFs in 3 x 10(4) cell/cm(2) were fixed by
      methanol for 5 min and air drying for 5 min. Thereafter, the methanol fixed MEF
      cells (MT-MEF) were able to be used directly to culture PSCs or stored at room
      temperature for the future usage. PSCs cultured on MT-MEF could be continuously
      expanded for over 40 passages with the naive pluripotency. MT-MEFs could also be 
      used to maintain human and pig iPSCs. Moreover, methanol fixed MEFs' culture dish
      was able to be reused for at least 4 times, and to be applied for antibiotic
      resistant screening assay to establishing stable transfected PSC lines.
      Alternatively, the immortalized cell lines, for instance NIH3T3 cells, could also
      be fixed by methanol and used as feeder cells to maintain PSCs. Thus, this novel 
      means of methanol fixed feeder cells can completely replace the mitomycin C and
      gamma radiation treated MEF feeder cells, and be used to maintain PSCs derived
      from mouse as well as other animal species.

TI  - Paenibacillus spp. isolated from human and environmental samples in Spain:
      detection of 11 new species.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1016/j.nmni.2017.05.006 [doi]
AB  - One hundred thirty-six isolates, 88 human and 48 environmental, that met the
      requirements to belong to the genus Paenibacillus were identified using a
      polyphasic taxonomic approach known as 16S rRNA plus phenotypic traits.
      Thirty-seven Paenibacillus species were identified; some had not been previously 
      reported from clinical samples. The main species were P. pabuli (13 isolates), P.
      provencensis (11), P. phoenicis (9) and P. lautus (8). P. pabuli (11/13) and P.
      provencensis (8/11) were mainly environmental isolates, while P. phoenicis (9/9) 
      and P. lautus (6/8) were mainly human isolates. Despite the difficulties in
      assigning to human Paenibacillus isolates a role as a pathogen or contaminant,
      here 25% of the isolates were involved in true infections, especially in those
      cases that affected abscesses, wound exudates, ocular infections and diverse
      fluids. In addition, 15 isolates were identified as 11 'Candidatus' to a new
      species, all of them from human specimens except one that was obtained from
      laboratory air. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed 95.6% of isolates
      were resistant to ampicillin, 44% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, 20 to 30% were
      resistant to cefotaxime and vancomycin and 13% were resistant to rifampicin and
      erythromycin.

TI  - [Determination of in vitro susceptibilities of Brucella spp. strains against 11
      different antibacterial gents isolated from blood cultures].
PG  - 260-268
LID - 10.5578/mb.57362 [doi]
AB  - Brucellosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease and still continuous to be a major
      public health problem. In this study, it was aimed to identify the Brucella
      strains to the species level isolated from blood cultures, and to determine the
      rate of antimicrobial susceptibility against eleven antibacterial agents. A total
      of 106 Brucella spp. strains were included in the study, which were isolated from
      blood cultures in University of Health Sciences, Konya Training and Research
      Hospital, Medical Microbiology Laboratory between January 2011 and June 2013.
      Identification of the isolated strains were mainly based on conventional methods.
      In vitro antibacterial susceptibilities of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin,
      doxycycline, gentamicin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, streptomycin,
      tetracycline, tigecycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, were evaluated by
      using the gradient (E-test, bioMerieux, France) strip method. The bacterial
      suspensions adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity was inoculated to Mueller Hinton 
      agar plates, supplemented with 5% sheep blood, and E-test strips of selected
      antibacterial were applied. The plates were incubated in ambient air 48 hours at 
      37 masculineC and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC
      29213 were used as quality control strains for antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing. Minimum inhibitors concentration (MIC) values were interpreted according
      to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines for slow-growing
      bacteria such as Haemophilus spp. Of the 106 Brucella spp. strains included in to
      the study, 90 were identified as Brucella melitensis, and 16 were Brucella
      abortus. MIC90 values of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamicin,
      levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, tigecycline, 
      and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined as 1 microg/ml, 0.25 microg/ml,
      0.19 microg/ml, 0.25 microg/ml, 0.19 microg/ml, 0.75 microg/ml, 0.25 microg/ml,
      0.75 microg/ml, 0.38 microg/ml, 0.64 microg/ml, and 0.19 microg/ml respectively. 
      According to MIC90 values, gentamicin, moxifloxacin, and
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, were the most effective antibacterial agents. All 
      the Brucella strains were sensitive to all the tested antibacterial agents except
      rifampicin. Only six isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to rifampicin.
      With regard to fluoroquinolones, the most active antibacterial agent was
      moxifloxacin, followed by ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. In our study, no
      resistance was found for the classically recommended antibacterial agents used in
      the treatment of Brucella species in our hospital but antibiotic susceptibility
      patterns of Brucella spp. may vary geographically. As a result it was concluded
      that, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Brucella species should be determined
      and controlled periodically to avoid the possible development of resistance
      problems in the future.

PG  - 31
LID - 10.1038/s41467-017-02430-2 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial-fungal interactions are widely found in distinct environments and
      contribute to ecosystem processes. Previous studies of these interactions have
      mostly been performed in soil, and only limited studies of aerial plant tissues
      have been conducted. Here we show that a seed-borne plant pathogenic bacterium,
      Burkholderia glumae (Bg), and an air-borne plant pathogenic fungus, Fusarium
      graminearum (Fg), interact to promote bacterial survival, bacterial and fungal
      dispersal, and disease progression on rice plants, despite the production of
      antifungal toxoflavin by Bg. We perform assays of toxoflavin sensitivity, RNA-seq
      analyses, lipid staining and measures of triacylglyceride content to show that
      triacylglycerides containing linolenic acid mediate resistance to reactive oxygen
      species that are generated in response to toxoflavin in Fg. As a result, Bg is
      able to physically attach to Fg to achieve rapid and expansive dispersal to
      enhance disease severity.

TI  - Infection-stage adjusted dose of beta-lactams for parsimonious and efficient
      antibiotic treatments: A Pasteurella multocida experimental pneumonia in mice.
PG  - e0182863
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0182863 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the impact of infection stage on clinically and microbiologically 
      efficacious doses and on antibiotic consumption was assessed during a naturally
      evolving infectious disease, using an original mouse model of pulmonary infection
      produced by air-borne contamination. When Pasteurella multocida was administered 
      as pathogenic agent to immunocompetent mice, 60% of the animals exhibited
      clinical symptoms of pneumonia 2 to 4 days after bacterial contamination of the
      lungs. Two beta-lactam antibiotics were evaluated: amoxicillin and cefquinome, a 
      fourth generation cephalosporin developed for food animals. First, a
      pharmacokinetic study was performed in infected mice to determine the exposure to
      amoxicillin or cefquinome required to treat clinically affected animals, based on
      the targeted values of PK/PD indices for beta-lactams. We then confirmed that
      these doses resulted in a 100% clinical cure rate in animals exhibiting clinical 
      signs of infection and harboring a high pathogenic inoculum. More interestingly, 
      we also showed that the same 100% clinical cure could be obtained in our model
      with 10-fold lower doses in animals at pre-patent stages of infection i.e. when
      harboring a low pathogenic inoculum. At the group level, antimicrobial drug
      consumption was reduced by treating animals at an early stage of the infection
      course with a pre-patent tailored dose. These results suggest that early
      treatment with a dose suitably adjusted to the stage of infection might help to
      reduce both overall antibiotic consumption and resistance selection pressure in
      the animals and in the environment.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01542 [doi]
AB  - Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) was
      first found in 2005 and is up to date widespread in animal husbandry reservoir - 
      focusing on pig farming. The regular detectability of MRSA in the air of pigsties
      as well as in exhaust air of pig farms (mean count: 10(2) cfu/m(3)) poses the
      question whether an airborne spread and, therefore, a MRSA colonization of
      animals via the airborne route exists. To answer this question, we exposed three 
      groups of nine MRSA-negative tested piglets each to a defined airborne MRSA
      concentration (10(2), 10(4), and 10(6) cfu/m(3)) in our aerosol chamber for 24 h.
      In the following observation period of 21 days, the MRSA status of the piglets
      was monitored by taking different swab samples (nasal, pharyngeal, skin,
      conjunctival, and rectal swab). At the end of the experiment, we euthanized the
      piglets and investigated different tissues and organs for the spread of MRSA. The
      data of our study imply the presence of an airborne MRSA colonization route: the 
      animals exposed to 10(6) cfu/m(3) MRSA in the air were persistent colonized. The 
      piglets exposed to an airborne MRSA concentration of 10(4) cfu/m(3) were
      transient, and the piglets exposed to an airborne MRSA concentration of 10(2)
      cfu/m(3) were not colonized. Consequently, a colonization via the airborne route 
      was proven.

TI  - Effects of ionic liquids on the nanoscopic dynamics and phase behaviour of a
      phosphatidylcholine membrane.
PG  - 8969-8979
LID - 10.1039/c7sm01799e [doi]
AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) are potential candidates for new antimicrobials due to their 
      tunable antibacterial and antifungal properties that are required to keep pace
      with the growing challenge of bacterial resistance. To a great extent their
      antimicrobial actions are related to the interactions of ILs with cell membranes.
      Here, we report the effects of ILs on the nanoscopic dynamics and phase behaviour
      of a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membrane, a model cell membrane, as
      studied using neutron scattering techniques. Two prototypical imidazolium-based
      ILs 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM[BF4]) and
      1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (DMIM[BF4]), which differ only in
      terms of the alkyl chain length of cations, have been used for the present study.
      Fixed Elastic Window Scan (FEWS) shows that the incorporation of ILs affects the 
      phase behaviour of the phospholipid membrane significantly and the transition
      from a solid gel to a fluid phase shifts to lower temperature. This is found to
      be consistent with our differential scanning calorimetry measurements. DMIM[BF4],
      which has a longer alkyl chain cation, affects the phase behaviour more strongly 
      in comparison to BMIM[BF4]. The pressure-area isotherms of the DMPC monolayer
      measured at the air-water interface show that in the presence of ILs, isotherms
      shift towards higher area-per lipid molecule. DMIM[BF4] is found to shift the
      isotherm to a greater extent compared to BMIM[BF4]. Quasielastic neutron
      scattering (QENS) data show that both ILs act as a plasticizer, which enhances
      the fluidity of the membrane. DMIM[BF4] is found to be a stronger plasticizing
      agent in comparison to BMIM[BF4] that has a cation with a shorter alkyl chain.
      The incorporation of DMIM[BF4] enhances not only the long range lateral motion
      but also the localised internal motion of the lipids. On the other hand,
      BMIM[BF4] acts weakly in comparison to DMIM[BF4] and mainly alters the localised 
      internal motion of the lipids. Any subtle change in the dynamical properties of
      the membrane can profoundly affect the stability of the cell. Hence, the dominant
      effect of the IL with the longer chain length on the dynamics of the phospholipid
      membrane might be correlated with its cytotoxic activity. QENS data analysis has 
      provided a quantitative description of the effects of the two imidazolium-based
      ILs on the dynamical and phase behaviour of the model cell membrane, which is
      essential for a detailed understanding of their action mechanism.

      Endophytes.
LID - E952 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19040952 [doi]
AB  - There has been many recent studies on the use of microbial antagonists to control
      diseases incited by soilborne and airborne plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi,
      in an attempt to replace existing methods of chemical control and avoid extensive
      use of fungicides, which often lead to resistance in plant pathogens. In
      agriculture, plant growth-promoting and biocontrol microorganisms have emerged as
      safe alternatives to chemical pesticides. Streptomyces spp. and their metabolites
      may have great potential as excellent agents for controlling various fungal and
      bacterial phytopathogens. Streptomycetes belong to the rhizosoil microbial
      communities and are efficient colonizers of plant tissues, from roots to the
      aerial parts. They are active producers of antibiotics and volatile organic
      compounds, both in soil and in planta, and this feature is helpful for
      identifying active antagonists of plant pathogens and can be used in several
      cropping systems as biocontrol agents. Additionally, their ability to promote
      plant growth has been demonstrated in a number of crops, thus inspiring the wide 
      application of streptomycetes as biofertilizers to increase plant productivity.
      The present review highlights Streptomyces spp.-mediated functional traits, such 
      as enhancement of plant growth and biocontrol of phytopathogens.

AB  - Foodborne diseases associated with fresh produce consumption have escalated
      worldwide, causing microbial safety of produce of critical importance. Bacteria
      that have increasingly been detected in fresh produce are Escherichia coli and
      Salmonella spp., both of which have been shown to progressively display
      antimicrobial resistance. The study focused on the assessment of antimicrobial
      resistance of these enteric bacteria from different kinds of fresh produce from
      various open air markets and supermarkets in the Philippines. Using the disk
      diffusion assay on a total of 50 bacterial isolates obtained from 410 fresh
      produce surveyed, monoresistance to tetracycline was observed to be the most
      prevalent (38%), followed by multidrug resistance to tetracycline,
      chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid (4%), and lastly by dual
      resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol (2%). Using multiplex and simplex 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, tetA (75%) and tetB (9%) were found in
      tetracycline resistant isolates, whereas catI (67%) and catIII (33%) were
      detected in chloramphenicol resistant isolates. Sequence analysis of gyr and par 
      genes from the ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates revealed
      different mutations. Based on the results, fresh produce act as a reservoir of
      these antibiotic resistant bacteria which may pose health threat to consumers.

PG  - 6413179
LID - 10.1155/2018/6413179 [doi]
AB  - Background: The hospital environment is a source of medically important pathogens
      that are mostly multidrug resistant (MDR) and posing a major therapeutic
      challenge. The aim of this study was to assess the surface and air bacteriology
      of selected wards at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Northwest Ethiopia.
      Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from 15th February to 30th April
      2017. A total of 356 surface and air samples were collected from selected wards
      using 5% sheep blood agar (Oxoid, UK) and processed at FHRH microbiology
      laboratory following the standard bacteriological procedures. Pure isolates were 
      tested against the recommended antibiotics using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion
      methods, and the susceptibility profile was determined based on Clinical
      Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 
      version 23 for Windows. Results: Of the total 356 samples processed, 274 were
      from surfaces and 82 were from air. Among these, 141 (39.6%) showed bacterial
      growth, yielding a total of 190 isolates. Gram-positive isolates were predominant
      at 81.6% (n=155), while the gram negatives were at 18.4% (n=35). The main
      isolates were coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNs), 44%, followed by S.
      aureus, 37.4%, and Klebsiella species at 11.6%. The bacterial load on surfaces
      and air was found beyond the standard limits. Besides, the antimicrobial
      susceptibility profile of the isolates showed that about 75% of the identified
      isolates were found resistant for two and more antimicrobial agents tested.
      Conclusions: This study showed high degree of bacterial load that is beyond the
      standard limits on both surfaces and air samples of the hospital. Furthermore,
      some 75% of the isolates were found multidrug resistant. Therefore, it is
      important to evaluate and strengthen the infection prevention practice of the
      hospital. Moreover, stakeholders should also reinforce actions to decrease the
      pressure of antimicrobial resistance in the studied area.

TI  - Antimicrobial and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Ethanol Extract of Corylopsis
      coreana Uyeki Flos.
PG  - 286-292
LID - 10.4103/0973-1296.204554 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corylopsis coreana Uyeki (Hamamelidaceae) is a medicinal plant
      cultivated in Northeast Asia. Previously, we have reported that an ethanol
      extract of Corylopsis coreana Uyeki flos (ECCF) contains four active compounds
      with antioxidant activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate
      the antimicrobial spectrum against infectious bacteria and anti-inflammatory
      effect of ECCF in a mouse model of acute local inflammation. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using standard plate
      assay technique. Antimicrobial activities (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC;
      mug/mL) were determined with the serial dilution method. In vivo
      anti-inflammatory activity was studied using a mouse model of carrageenan-induced
      air pouch inflammation. RESULTS: The ECCF showed antimicrobial activities against
      general bacteria and drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus,
      Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Mycrobacterium smegmatis ATCC 9341, Mycrobacterium 
      smegmatis ATCC 9341, Salmonella typhimrium KCTC 1925, and nine
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, with MIC values ranging from
      250 to 1000 mug/mL. In in vivo mouse model, inflammatory morphologic changes
      observed in the air pouch membrane were restored to its normal condition by the
      ECCF treatment. Moreover, the ECCF significantly reduced exudate volumes, protein
      contents, inflammatory cell counts, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the
      exudates recovered from air pouches of the mouse model. Flavonoids in the ECCF
      were found to contain bergenin, quercitrin, and quercetin with reported
      anti-inflammatory activity via suppressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      production. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to
      demonstrate the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of ECCF. Our
      results suggest that the ECCF might potentially serve as an alternative or
      complementary medicine for treating inflammatory diseases caused by microbial
      infection. SUMMARY: ECCF showed antimicrobial activity against infectious
      bacteria and multidrug-resistant strains.ECCF exhibited anti-inflammatory
      activity in a carrageenan-induced air pouch mouse model.ECCF contained several
      active constituents such as bergenin, quercitrin, and quercetin. Abbreviations
      used:Corylopsis coreana CCF: Uyeki flos, ECCF: ethanol extract of CCF.

TI  - The LacI-Family Transcription Factor, RbsR, Is a Pleiotropic Regulator of
      Motility, Virulence, Siderophore and Antibiotic Production, Gas Vesicle
      Morphogenesis and Flotation in Serratia.
PG  - 1678
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2017.01678 [doi]
AB  - Gas vesicles (GVs) are proteinaceous, gas-filled organelles used by some bacteria
      to enable upward movement into favorable air/liquid interfaces in aquatic
      environments. Serratia sp. ATCC39006 (S39006) was the first enterobacterium
      discovered to produce GVs naturally. The regulation of GV assembly in this host
      is complex and part of a wider regulatory network affecting various phenotypes,
      including antibiotic biosynthesis. To identify new regulators of GVs, a
      comprehensive mutant library containing 71,000 insertion mutants was generated by
      random transposon mutagenesis and 311 putative GV-defective mutants identified.
      Three of these mutants were found to have a transposon inserted in a LacI family 
      transcription regulator gene (rbsR) of the putative ribose operon. Each of these 
      rbsR mutants was GV-defective; no GVs were visible by phase contrast microscopy
      (PCM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). GV deficiency was caused by the 
      reduction of gvpA1 and gvrA transcription (the first genes of the two contiguous 
      operons in the GV gene locus). Our results also showed that a mutation in rbsR
      was highly pleiotropic; the production of two secondary metabolites (carbapenem
      and prodigiosin antibiotics) was abolished. Interestingly, the intrinsic
      resistance to the carbapenem antibiotic was not affected by the rbsR mutation. In
      addition, the production of a siderophore, cellulase and plant virulence was
      reduced in the mutant, whereas it exhibited increased swimming and swarming
      motility. The RbsR protein was predicted to bind to regions upstream of at least 
      18 genes in S39006 including rbsD (the first gene of the ribose operon) and gvrA.
      Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirmed that RbsR bound to DNA
      sequences upstream of rbsD, but not gvrA. The results of this study indicate that
      RbsR is a global regulator that affects the modulation of GV biogenesis, but also
      with complex pleiotropic physiological impacts in S39006.

TI  - Assessment of in vivo versus in vitro biofilm formation of clinical
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from endotracheal tubes.
PG  - 11906
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-30494-7 [doi]
AB  - Our aim was to demonstrate that biofilm formation in a clinical strain of
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can be enhanced by environment
      exposure in an endotracheal tube (ETT) and to determine how it is affected by
      systemic treatment and atmospheric conditions. Second, we aimed to assess biofilm
      production dynamics after extubation. We prospectively analyzed 70 ETT samples
      obtained from pigs randomized to be untreated (controls, n = 20), or treated with
      vancomycin (n = 32) or linezolid (n = 18). A clinical MRSA strain (MRSA-in) was
      inoculated in pigs to create a pneumonia model, before treating with antibiotics.
      Tracheally intubated pigs with MRSA severe pneumonia, were mechanically
      ventilated for 69 +/- 16 hours. All MRSA isolates retrieved from ETTs (ETT-MRSA) 
      were tested for their in vitro biofilm production by microtiter plate assay. In
      vitro biofilm production of MRSA isolates was sequentially studied over the next 
      8 days post-extubation to assess biofilm capability dynamics over time. All
      experiments were performed under ambient air (O2) or ambient air supplemented
      with 5% CO2. We collected 52 ETT-MRSA isolates (placebo N = 19, linezolid N = 11,
      and vancomycin N = 22) that were clonally identical to the MRSA-in. Among the
      ETT-MRSA isolates, biofilm production more than doubled after extubation in 40%
      and 50% under 5% CO2 and O2, respectively. Systemic antibiotic treatment during
      intubation did not affect this outcome. Under both atmospheric conditions,
      biofilm production for MRSA-in was at least doubled for 9 ETT-MRSA isolates, and 
      assessment of these showed that biofilm production decreased progressively over a
      4-day period after extubation. In conclusion, a weak biofilm producer MRSA strain
      significantly enhances its biofilm production within an ETT, but it is influenced
      by the ETT environment rather than by the systemic treatment used during
      intubation or by the atmospheric conditions used for bacterial growth.

AB  - Air pollution has become a major environmental concern given the ever increasing 
      levels of particulate matter (PM) and the increased in treatment-resistant
      bacterial and viral strains. Major efforts are therefore required into the
      development of air filtration and purification technology as well as novel,
      alternative antiviral and antibacterial treatment modalities. Here, we report an 
      environmentally friendly method for the generation of multifunctional poly(vinyl 
      alcohol)/poly(acrylic acid) (PVA-PAA) composite membranes via green
      electrospinning and thermal crosslinking. Superhydrophobic silica nanoparticles
      were then incorporated into the fibers resulting in a rough surface, after which 
      AgNO3 was introduced, resulting in the formation of Ag nanoparticles through UV
      reduction. The PVA-PAA-SiO2-Ag NPs membranes were found to possess high air
      filtration performance (with >98% filtration efficiency for PM2.5) as well as
      potent antibacterial and antiviral activities. The green synthesis approach
      avoids the use of hazardous organic solvents, thereby bypassing any potential
      toxicity concerns caused by organic solvent residues. These newly designed
      PVA-PAA-SiO2 NPs-Ag NPs nanofibrous membranes with many superior features (e.g.
      high filtration efficiency, high tensile strength, biological compatibility, and 
      antibacterial properties) can be applied in eco-friendly air filtration
      materials, in particular for personal air filtration devices.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2017.00926 [doi]
AB  - Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the causative agent of chronic respiratory disease
      (CRD), a prevalent disease of poultry, which is responsible for significant
      economic losses in farms. Although several antimicrobial agents are currently
      recommended for the treatment and prevention of M. gallisepticum infections,
      investigations of M. gallisepticum have been hampered by their fastidious growth 
      requirements and slow growth rate. As such, little work has been conducted
      concerning the PK/PD relationship and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance between
      antimicrobials against M. gallisepticum. In the present study, danofloxacin was
      orally administrated to the infected chickens once daily for 3 days by an
      established in vivo M. gallisepticum infection model. Not only the concentrations
      of danofloxacin in plasma and lung tissues were analyzed, but also the counting
      of viable cells and changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in air sac and lung
      were determined. The PK and PD data were fitted by WinNonlin to evaluate the
      PK/PD interactions of danofloxacin against M. gallisepticum. PCR amplification of
      quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and DNA sequencing were
      performed to identify point mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE of the
      selected resistant mutant strains. In addition, susceptibility of enrofloxacin,
      ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and norfloxacin against these mutant
      strains were also determined. The PK profiles indicated that danofloxacin
      concentration in the lung tissues was higher than plasma. Mycoplasmacidal
      activity was achieved when infected chickens were exposed to danofloxacin at the 
      dose group above 2.5 mg/kg. The ratios of AUC24/MIC (the area under the
      concentration-time curve over 24 h divided by the MIC) for 2 log10 (CFU) and 3
      log10 (CFU) reduction were 31.97 and 97.98 L h/kg, respectively. Substitutions of
      Ser-83-->Arg or Glu-87-->Gly in gyrA; Glu-84-->Lys in parC were observed in the
      resistant mutant strains that were selected from the dose group of 1 and 2.5
      mg/kg. MICs of danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin,
      and norfloxacin against the resistant mutant strains with a single mutation in
      position-83 were higher than that with a single mutation in position-87. These
      findings suggested that danofloxacin may be therapeutically effective to treat M.
      gallisepticum infection in chickens if administered at a dosage of 5.5 mg/kg once
      daily for 3 days.

TI  - Impact of airborne zinc pollution on the antimicrobial activity of olive oil and 
      the microbial metabolic profiles of Zn-contaminated soils in an Italian olive
      orchard.

AB  - The growing of microbial resistance leads to a great interest about some natural 
      alternatives to synthetic compounds. This study was carried out in two olive
      orchards (Olea europaea L., cv. Coratina) South Italy (Basilicata region), one
      located in a polluted area near a fertilizers factory releasing Zn and the other 
      in a control unpolluted site, both managed with similar cultivation techniques.
      Olive oil samples were studied from both areas during 2014 and 2015. The soil
      microbiological status of the polluted and unpolluted orchards has been
      characterized and the antimicrobial effects of olive oils extracted from polluted
      plants (PP) and control plants (CP) against some phytopathogens have been
      explored. Results showed that the antibacterial activity of PP oil was
      significantly higher than CP and this could be due to the high content of some
      phenolic compounds elicited by air and soil Zn pollution (especially in the layer
      0-20cm). There is no detectable antifungal activity of the studied oils. The
      metabolic activity (both total and for each carbon substrate group), diversity
      and evenness of PP soil bacterial communities were significantly different from
      CP soil, while the effects of soil depth was negligible. The same parameters
      measured on soil fungal communities are lower in PP soil at 0-20cm soil depth.
      The current research clarified the impact of atmospheric Zn pollution on the
      antimicrobial activity of olive oil and the soil microbial metabolic profiles.
      The bioactive substances extracted from olive oils growing in Zn-polluted area
      might be used as antibiotics.

AB  - Essential oils of herbal origin are widely used in the treatment of diseases of
      the upper and lower respiratory tract primarily due to their antibacterial and
      antiviral effects. Menthol, the major component of the essential oil of mint
      (Mentha) species, exhibits antispasmodic activity, which might result in improved
      lung function. In a randomized experiment, 106 healthy participants received
      nebulized peppermint, eucalyptus, or rosemary essential oil for 15min or no
      treatment (control). None of the essential oils had an impact on the measured
      spirometric variables (forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow, the ratio of 
      the volume of air forcibly blown out in the first second to forced vital
      capacity). Participants' expectations regarding the effects of essential oils did
      not affect their objective performance, however, they predicted perceived
      (subjective) changes. Perceived and measured changes were not connected with each
      other. In conclusion, inhaled rosemary, peppermint, and eucalyptus essential
      oils' subjective (perceived) effect on spirometry is mediated at least partly by 
      expectations.

      3,7-Dimethyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane Ligand: Synthesis,
      Characterization, and Antimicrobial Activity.
PG  - 6309-6323
LID - 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00227 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes the preparation and comprehensive characterization of a
      series of water-soluble cationic silver(I)-centered complexes featuring the
      hemilabile P, N-ligand known as
      3,7-dimethyl-1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (herein abbreviated as
      PTN(Me)) and differing types of monoanionic counterions including known
      biologically active sulfadiazine and triclosan. The complexes primarily differed 
      though the number of coordinating PTN(Me) ligands. The bis-substituted Ag(I)
      complexes revealed P, N bidentate coordination, while the only P-monocoordination
      of the metal center was observed for the tris-substituted systems. The
      bis-ligated silver compounds were observed to quickly degrade upon photoexposure 
      or in contact with air. In contrast, the tris-ligated complexes demonstrated
      greater stability, in particular, a high resistance to photo-decomposition.
      Calculated geometry optimized models using the density functional theory method
      (BP86) revealed for the bis-substituted PTN(Me) Ag(I) species that the total
      enthalpy of the tetrahedral C2-symmetric structure is marginally lower by -0.6
      kcal mol(-1) compared to the planar C2 h structure, which is analogous for the
      corresponding [Au(PTN(Me))2](+) complex with Delta H = -0.5 kcal mol(-1). Hence
      both types of complexes feature free rotation of the PTN ligand about the M-P
      bond axis. This series of Ag(I) and bis-PTN(Me) Au(I) complexes were evaluated
      using the agar well diffusion test for potential antimicrobial and antifungal
      activity. The nature of the counterion was found to have a strong correlation
      with the area of microbiological growth inhibition. Silver(I) complexes bearing
      the deprotonated triclosan as the counterion demonstrated the greatest activity, 
      with large zones of growth inhibition, with the tris-ligated triclosan complex
      obtaining of a high clearance of 42 mm against the Gram-negative Escherichia
      coli. In contrast, the previously reported [Au(PTN(Me))2]Cl complex demonstrated 
      activity only against E. coli, which is lower than that observed for the
      silver(I) PTN(Me) species.

AB  - Information is currently limited regarding the distribution of antibiotic
      resistance genes (ARGs) in smog and their correlations with airborne bacteria.
      This study characterized the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the particulate
      matters (PMs) of severe smog based on publicly available metagenomic data, and
      revealed the occurrence of 205 airborne ARG subtypes, including 31 dominant ones 
      encoding resistance to 11 antibiotic types. Among the detectable ARGs,
      tetracycline, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance genes had the highest
      abundance, and smog and soil had similar composition characteristics of ARGs.
      During the smog event, the total abundance of airborne ARGs ranged from 4.90 to
      38.07ppm in PM2.5 samples, and from 7.61 to 38.49ppm in PM10 samples, which were 
      1.6-7.7 times and 2.1-5.1 times of those in the non-smog day, respectively. The
      airborne ARGs showed complicated co-occurrence patterns, which were heavily
      influenced by the interaction of bacterial community, and physicochemical and
      meteorological factors. Lactobacillus and sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 were
      determined as keystones in the co-occurrence network of microbial taxa and
      airborne ARGs. The results may help to understand the distribution patterns of
      ARGs in smog for the potential health risk evaluation.

AB  - Increasing evidence from recent reports of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains
      poses a challenge worldwide. Drug-resistant strains often undergo mutations,
      adopt alternative pathways, and express drug efflux pumps to reduce or eliminate 
      drug doses. Besides these intrinsic resistance mechanisms, bacteria can evade
      drug doses by forming biofilms. Biofilms are the concerted growth of adherent
      microorganisms, which can also be formed at the air-water interface. The growth
      is supported by the extracellular polymer matrix which is self-produced by the
      microorganisms. Reduced metabolic activity in a nutrient-deficient environment in
      the biofilm may cause the microorganisms to take alternative pathways that can
      make the microorganisms recalcitrant to the drug doses. Recent works have shown
      that Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses several proteins during its growth in
      biofilm, those when deleted, did not show any effect on mycobacterial growth in
      normal nutrient-sufficient conditions. Studying these unconventional proteins in 
      mycobacterial biofilms is therefore of utmost importance. In this article, I will
      discuss one such mycobacterial biofilm-related protein FabG4 that is recently
      shown to be important for mycobacterial survival in the presence of antibiotic
      stressors and limited nutrient condition. In an attempt to find more effective
      FabG4 inhibitors and its importance in biofilm forming M. tuberculosis, present
      knowledge about FabG4 and its known inhibitors are discussed. Based on the
      existing data, a putative role of FabG4 is also suggested.

TI  - Extended spectrum and metalo beta-lactamase producing airborne Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii in restricted settings of a referral
      hospital: a neglected condition.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.1186/s13756-017-0266-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequently encountered multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates of P.
      aeruginosa and A. baumannii are common and prevalent in a hospital environment.
      The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and pattern of antibiotic
      resistance, extended spectrum and metallo beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa 
      and A. baumannii isolates from restricted settings of indoor air hospital
      environment. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in
      Wolaita Sodo University Teaching and referral Hospital, Ethiopia from December
      1/2015 to April 30/2015. The Air samples were collected from delivery room,
      intensive care unit and operation theatre of the hospital by active, Anderson six
      slate sampler technique during the first week of the months, twice a week during 
      Monday's and Friday's. Standard microbiological procedures were followed to
      isolate P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Susceptibility testing was performed on
      isolates using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique. Extended spectrum beta
      lactamase production was detected by double disc synergy test and
      Imipenem-resistant isolates were screened for producing Metallo-beta lactamase.
      RESULTS: A total number of 216 indoor air samples were collected from the
      delivery room, intensive care unit, and operation room. Correspondingly, 43 A.
      baumannii isolates were identified (13 from delivery room, 21 from intensive care
      unit and 9 from operation room). Likewise 24 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained
      (4 from delivery room, 13 from intensive care unit and 7 from operation room).
      Extended spectrum beta lactamase and metalo-beta lactamase production were
      observed in 24 (55.8%) and 13 (30.2%) isolates of A. baumannii respectively,
      whereas P. aeruginosa showed 15 (62.5%) extended spectrum beta lactamase and 9
      (37.5%) metallo-beta lactamase production. CONCLUSIONS: Extended spectrum beta
      lactamase and metallo-beta lactamase producing bacteria in hospital air is a new 
      dimension for specific setting of the study area where antimicrobial resistance
      is increasing and surgical site infection is prevalent. So, identification of
      these microorganisms has a great role in reducing the burden of antibiotic
      resistance and could also provide a significant input for framing hospital
      infection control policies.

TI  - Prospective survey of azole drug resistance among environmental and clinical
      isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus in a French University hospital during major
      demolition works.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have reported the emerging worldwide problem of azole 
      drug resistance of A. fumigatus isolates. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the antifungal susceptibilities of A. fumigatus isolates recovered from air and
      clinical samples collected in a French University hospital (Lyon), which
      underwent major deconstruction works over a one year-period. METHODS: A daily
      surveillance of fungal contamination was implemented during 11-months.
      Environmental survey was realized by air samplings, outdoor and indoor, with an
      automatic agar sampler. In parallel, surveillance of IA infection cases was
      conducted by epidemiological investigation. Environmental and clinical isolates
      of A. fumigatus were identified by conventional methods and beta-tubulin
      sequencing. Susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus isolates against Itraconazole 
      (ITZ), Voriconazole (VCZ) was performed using Etest method. RESULTS: A total of
      3885 air samples (1744 outdoor samples and 2141 indoor samples) were collected.
      From the 3073 identified colonies of A. fumigatus, 400 A. fumigatus isolates were
      tested for their susceptibility to ITZ and VCZ, including 388 isolates coming
      from the environment (indoor n:157, outdoor n:231) and 12 isolates coming from
      clinical samples. All the 400 isolates were susceptible to azoles (</=1mug/mL).
      CONCLUSIONS: No environmental reservoir of A. fumigatus azole resistant strains
      was found in our hospital which was undergoing major demolition works. Further
      studies with larger number of A. fumigatus clinical isolates and environmental
      isolates from agricultural areas and healthcare establishments are needed to
      better appreciate the occurrence and prevalence of azole resistance.

      metabolism and mycoparasitism.
PG  - e0193872
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0193872 [doi]
AB  - Some filamentous fungi of the Trichoderma genus are used as biocontrol agents
      against airborne and soilborne phytopathogens. The proposed mechanism by which
      Trichoderma spp. antagonizes phytopathogens is through the release of lytic
      enzymes, antimicrobial compounds, mycoparasitism, and the induction of systemic
      disease-resistance in plants. Here we analyzed the role of TGF-1 (Trichoderma Gcn
      Five-1), a histone acetyltransferase of Trichoderma atroviride, in mycoparasitism
      and antibiosis against the phytopathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Trichostatin A
      (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that promotes histone acetylation,
      slightly affected T. atroviride and R. solani growth, but not the growth of the
      mycoparasite over R. solani. Application of TSA to the liquid medium induced
      synthesis of antimicrobial compounds. Expression analysis of the
      mycoparasitism-related genes ech-42 and prb-1, which encode an endochitinase and 
      a proteinase, as well as the secondary metabolism-related genes pbs-1 and tps-1, 
      which encode a peptaibol synthetase and a terpene synthase, respectively, showed 
      that they were regulated by TSA. A T. atroviride strain harboring a deletion of
      tgf-1 gene showed slow growth, thinner and less branched hyphae than the
      wild-type strain, whereas its ability to coil around the R. solani hyphae was not
      affected. Deltatgf-1 presented a diminished capacity to grow over R. solani, but 
      the ability of its mycelium -free culture filtrates (MFCF) to inhibit the
      phytopathogen growth was enhanced. Intriguingly, addition of TSA to the culture
      medium reverted the enhanced inhibition growth of Deltatgf-1 MFCF on R. solani at
      levels compared to the wild-type MFCF grown in medium amended with TSA. The
      presence of R. solani mycelium in the culture medium induced similar proteinase
      activity in a Deltatgf-1 compared to the wild-type, whereas the chitinolytic
      activity was higher in a Deltatgf-1 mutant in the absence of R. solani, compared 
      to the parental strain. Expression of mycoparasitism- and secondary
      metabolism-related genes in Deltatgf-1 was differentially regulated in the
      presence or absence of R. solani. These results indicate that histone acetylation
      may play important roles in the biocontrol mechanisms of T. atroviride.

TI  - Characterization of biofilm-forming capacity and resistance to sanitizers of a
      range of E. coli O26 pathotypes from clinical cases and cattle in Australia.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/s12866-018-1182-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The formation of biofilms and subsequent encasement of bacterial
      cells in a complex matrix can enhance resistance to antimicrobials and
      sterilizing agents making these organisms difficult to eradicate and control. The
      aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the capacity of 40 E. coli O26
      isolates of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC, n = 27), potential EHEC (pEHEC, n = 
      3), atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC, n = 8) and non-toxigenic E. coli
      (NTEC, n = 2) from human and cattle sources to form biofilms on different
      surfaces, and determine whether extracellular matrix (ECM) components (cellulose,
      curli), motility, prophage insertion in mlrA and cell surface hydrophobicity
      could influence biofilm formation. Finally, the influence of biofilm formation on
      the sensitivity of isolates to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs; Profoam,
      Kwiksan 22) and peracetic acid-based sanitizer (Topactive Des.) for 2 min on
      polystyrene plate were also evaluated. RESULTS: Biofilm production on one surface
      may not indicate biofilm formation on a different surface. Biofilm was formed by 
      different pathotypes on polystyrene (70%), stainless steel (87.5%) and glass
      slides (95%), however only 50% demonstrated pellicle formation. EHEC isolates
      were significantly more likely to form a pellicle at the air-liquid interface and
      biofilms on polystyrene surface at 48 h than aEPEC. Strains that don't produce
      ECM (curli or cellulose), harbor a prophage insertion in mlrA, and are non-motile
      have lower biofilm forming capacities than those isolates possessing combinations
      of these attributes. Hydrophobicity had no impact on biofilm formation. After 2
      min exposure, none of the disinfectants tested were able to completely inactivate
      all cells within a biofilm regardless of pathotypes and the amount of biofilm
      formed. CONCLUSION: Pathotypes of E. coli O26 showed varying capacities to form
      biofilms, however, most EHEC strains had the capacity to form biofilm on all
      surfaces and at the air-liquid interface under the conditions used in this study.
      Biofilms provided a protective effect to E. coli O26 strains against the three
      sanitizers, previously shown to successfully control the growth of their
      planktonic counterparts. Whether the characteristics of biofilm forming and
      non-biofilm forming strains observed in this study reflect their attributes
      within the food and meat-processing environments is unknown. Further studies that
      represent the food and meat-processing environments are required.

AB  - A study on the hybrid functionalization of cotton and viscose fabrics using
      silver nanowires (AgNWs) colloid and titanium dioxide (TiO2) sol prepared in
      sol-gel technique was carried out. The microwave treatment was applied to change 
      amorphous form of TiO2 to anatase. The photocatalytic activity of both cellulose 
      fabrics was evaluated by decomposition of nicotine using new method on the basis 
      of infrared spectroscopy. The AgNWs/TiO2 modification caused 3 and 4 times
      (cotton fabric) and 1.8 and 1.5 (viscose fabric) faster decomposition of nicotine
      under respectively UV and VIS light than for unmodified fabrics. The AgNWs/TiO2
      modified cotton showed the surface resistance 1.5x10(3)Omega and antibacterial
      effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria. The same
      modification method gives various effects for cotton and viscose fabrics. Our
      study demonstrates that AgNWs/TiO2 modified cotton fabric with protective
      properties against bacteria can be used as conductive and air purifying
      materials.

      Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan.
PG  - 429-437
AB  - The hospital environment plays an important role in the spread of microorganisms,
      including multi drug resistant (MDR) strains. Patients can acquire
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which can reside in the
      clinical setup that are not cleaned and can spread through air droplets, bed
      clothing, and healthcare workers. The purpose of this study was to investigate
      the prevalence of S. aureus in the Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH). A total of 200
      samples were collected from the floor, walls, air and inanimate objects in
      different wards of the KTH, during May 2012 to September 2012. These samples were
      screened for the recovery of S. aureus. Recovered organisms were subjected to
      susceptibility testing and investigated for the detection of various toxin and
      antibiotic resistance genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A total of 64
      samples yielded S. aureus, out of which 37 (57.81%) were proved as MRSA. No
      isolate was found resistant to Vancomycin, however 81.25% of the isolates were
      found susceptible to Linezolid and Amikacin. The susceptibility to Fusidic acid, 
      Chloramphenicol, Rifampicin, Doxycycline and Meropenem was observed as 79.69%,
      76.56%, 75.00, 73.44% and 68.75% respectively. The frequency of sea, seb and sec 
      genes were 56.25%, 43.75% and 12.5% in the recovered isolates. Erm C was more
      prevalent (28.12 %) than the ermA and ermB. The prevalence of pvl in MRSA was
      21.62 % which is less than 33.33% in the MSSA isolates. S. aureus and especially 
      MRSA are frequently prevalent in the KTH. Therefore, every immune-compromised
      patient is prone to infections caused by S. aureus. This will lead to high
      morbidity/mortality rate, prolong hospital stay and add extra cost to the health 
      system.

AB  - Composting is considered to reduce the introduction of antimicrobial resistance
      genes (ARGs) into the environment through land application of manure; however,
      the possible pollution of ARGs in the atmospheric environment of composting
      plants is unknown. In this study, 29 air samples including up- and downwind,
      composting, packaging, and office areas from 4 composting plants were collected. 
      Dynamic concentrations of 22 subtypes of ARGs, class 1 integron (intl1), and 2
      potential human pathogenic bacteria (HPB), and bacterial communities were
      investigated using droplet digital PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
      respectively. In this study, intl1 and 22 subtypes of ARGs (except tetQ) were
      detected in air of composting, packaging, office, and downwind areas. The highest
      concentration of 15 out of 22 subtypes of ARGs was detected in the packaging
      areas, and intl1 also had the maximum average concentration of 10(4)copies/m(3), 
      with up to (1.78+/-0.49)x10(-2) copies/16S rRNA copy. Non-metric
      multi-dimensional scaling of ARGs, potential HPBs, and bacterial components all
      indicated that the bioaerosol pollutant pattern in packaging areas was most
      similar to that in composting areas, followed by office, downwind, and upwind
      areas. The co-occurrence between ARGs and bacterial taxa assessed by Procrustes
      test, mantel test, and network analysis implied that aerosolized ARG fragments
      from composting and packaging areas contributed to the compositions of ARG
      aerosols in office and downwind areas. The results presented here show that
      atmoshperic environments of composting plants harbor abundant and diverse ARGs,
      which highlight the urgent need for comprehensive evaluation of potential human
      health and ecological risks of composts during both production as well as land
      application.

AB  - Particles exhausted from petrol and diesel consumptions are major components of
      urban air pollution that can be exposed to human via direct inhalation or other
      routes due to atmospheric deposition into water and soil. Antimicrobial
      resistance is one of the most serious threats to modern health care. However, how
      the petrol and diesel exhaust particles affect the development and spread of
      antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in various environments remain largely
      unknown. This study investigated the effects and potential mechanisms of four
      representative petrol and diesel exhaust particles, namely 97 octane petrol, 93
      octane petrol, light diesel oil, and marine heavy diesel oil, on the horizontal
      transfer of ARGs between two opportunistic Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains, E.
      coli S17-1 (donor) and E. coli K12 (recipient). The results demonstrated that
      these four representative types of nano-scale particles induced
      concentration-dependent increases in conjugative transfer rates compared with the
      controls. The underlying mechanisms involved in the accelerated transfer of ARGs 
      were also identified, including the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) and the consequent induction of oxidative stress, SOS response,
      changes in cell morphology, and the altered mRNA expression of membrane protein
      genes and those involved in the promotion of conjugative transfer. The findings
      provide new evidences and mechanistic insights into the antimicrobial resistance 
      risks posed by petrol and diesel exhaust particles, and highlight the
      implications and need for stringent strategies on alternative fuels to mitigate
      air pollution and health risks.

      morphometry, cell wall architecture, spore surface character, cell adhesion, and 
      biofilm formation.
PG  - 621-630
LID - 10.1093/mmy/myx082 [doi]
AB  - Systemic human fungal infections are increasingly common. Aspergillus species
      cause most of the airborne fungal infections. Life-threatening invasive
      aspergillosis was formerly found only in immune-suppressed patients, but recently
      some strains of A. fumigatus have become primary pathogens. Many fungal cell wall
      components are absent from mammalian systems, so they are potential drug targets.
      Cell-wall-targeting drugs such as echinocandins are used clinically, although
      echinocandin-resistant strains were discovered shortly after their introduction. 
      Currently there are no fully effective anti-fungal drugs. Fungal cell wall
      glycoconjugates modulate human immune responses, as well as fungal cell adhesion,
      biofilm formation, and drug resistance. Guanosine diphosphate (GDP) mannose
      transporters (GMTs) transfer GDP-mannose from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen
      prior to mannosylation. Aspergillus nidulans GMTs are encoded by gmtA and gmtB.
      Here we elucidate the roles of A. nidulans GMTs. Strains engineered to lack
      either or both GMTs were assessed for hyphal and colonial morphology, cell wall
      ultrastructure, antifungal susceptibility, spore hydrophobicity, adherence and
      biofilm formation. The gmt-deleted strains had smaller colonies with reduced
      sporulation and with thicker hyphal walls. The gmtA deficient spores had reduced 
      hydrophobicity and were less adherent and less able to form biofilms in vitro.
      Thus, gmtA not only participates in maintaining the cell wall integrity but also 
      plays an important role in biofilm establishment and adherence of A. nidulans.
      These findings suggested that GMTs have roles in A. nidulans growth and cell-cell
      interaction and could be a potential target for new antifungals that target
      virulence determinants.

TI  - Genomic relatedness of Staphylococcus pettenkoferi isolates of different origins.
PG  - 601-608
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.000472 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to characterize clinical and environmental
      Staphylococcus pettenkoferi isolates with regard to genomic diversity and
      antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Repetitive-sequence-based PCR and core genome 
      phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data verified the presence
      of distinct clades comprising closely related S. pettenkoferi isolates from
      different geographical locations and origins. METHODOLOGY: Phylogenetic
      relationships between 25 S. pettenkoferi isolates collected from blood cultures
      and intra-operative air sampling were determined by repetitive-sequence-based PCR
      typing and analysis of ~157 000 SNPs identified in the core genome after WGS.
      Antibiotic susceptibility testing and tests for biofilm production (microtitre
      plate assay) were performed. RESULTS: Repetitive-sequence-based PCR as well as
      WGS data demonstrated the close relatedness of clinically significant blood
      culture isolates to probable contaminants, as well as to environmental isolates. 
      Antibiotic-susceptibility testing demonstrated a low level of antimicrobial
      resistance. The mecA gene was present in two cefoxitin-resistant isolates. No
      isolates were found to produce biofilm. CONCLUSION: Close genomic relatedness of 
      S. pettenkoferi isolates from different geographical locations and origins were
      found within clades, but with substantial genomic difference between the two
      major clades. The ecological niche of S. pettenkoferi remains unconfirmed, but
      the presence of S. pettenkoferi in the air of the operating field favours the
      suggestion of a role in skin flora. Identification of S. pettenkoferi in clinical
      samples should, in a majority of cases, most likely be regarded as a probable
      contamination, and its role as a possible pathogen in immunocompromised hosts
      remains to be clarified.

TI  - Induction of beta-Lactamase Activity and Decreased beta-Lactam Susceptibility by 
      CO2 in Clinical Bacterial Isolates.
LID - e00266-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00266-17 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates is a crucial step
      toward appropriate treatment of infectious diseases. The clinical isolate
      Francisella philomiragia 14IUHPL001, recently isolated from a 63-year-old woman
      with atypical pneumonia, featured decreased susceptibility to beta-lactam
      antibiotics when cultivated in 5% CO2. Quantitative beta-lactamase assays
      demonstrated a significant (P < 0.0001) increase in enzymatic activity between
      bacteria cultivated in 5% CO2 over those incubated in ambient air. The presence
      of beta-lactamase genes blaTEM and blaSHV was detected in the clinical isolate F.
      philomiragia 14IUHPL001 by PCR, and the genes were positively identified by
      nucleotide sequencing. Expression of blaTEM and blaSHV was detected by reverse
      transcription-PCR during growth at 5% CO2 but not during growth in ambient air. A
      statistically significant alkaline shift was observed following cultivation of F.
      philomiragia 14IUHPL001 in both ambient air and 5% CO2, allowing desegregation of
      the previously reported effects of acidic pH from the currently reported effect
      of 5% CO2 on blaTEM and blaSHV beta-lactamases. To ensure that the observed
      phenomenon was not unique to F. philomiragia, we evaluated a clinical isolate of 
      blaTEM-carrying Haemophilus influenzae and found parallel induction of blaTEM
      gene expression and beta-lactamase activity at 5% CO2 relative to ambient air.
      IMPORTANCE beta-Lactamase induction and concurrent beta-lactam resistance in
      respiratory tract pathogens as a consequence of growth in a physiologically
      relevant level of CO2 are of clinical significance, particularly given the
      ubiquity of TEM and SHV beta-lactamase genes in diverse bacterial pathogens. This
      is the first report of beta-lactamase induction by 5% CO2.

TI  - Occurrence and Antibiotic Susceptibility of Listeria Species and Staphylococcus
      aureus in Cattle Slaughterhouses of Kerala, South India.
PG  - 573-579
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2017.2293 [doi]
AB  - A total of 765 samples were collected from beef carcasses, knives, cutting table 
      surfaces, beef, hands, air, and water from four cattle slaughterhouses of Kerala,
      South India, to determine the occurrence and antibiotic susceptibility of
      Listeria species and Staphylococcus aureus. Listeria spp. were isolated from beef
      carcasses (2.0%), knives (3.7%), cutting table surfaces (1.9%), beef (0.7%), and 
      water (1.3%). The identified species were Listeria monocytogenes (0.1%), Listeria
      innocua (0.9%), and Listeria ivanovii (0.4%). Most of the Listeria spp. were
      susceptible to majority of the antibiotics tested. The virulence genes were not
      detected in Listeria spp. However, all the L. innocua isolates were found to
      harbor the iap gene. The overall occurrence of S. aureus in slaughterhouses was
      50.8%. The highest occurrence was observed on hands of abattoir workers (79.6%)
      and beef carcasses (59.9%). The isolates were commonly resistant to penicillin
      (38.0%), followed by ceftriaxone (31.9%), ampicillin (29.0%), amoxicillin
      (28.8%), tetracycline (24.4%), and chloramphenicol (23.9%). Overall, 53.0% of S. 
      aureus isolates were resistant to three or more antibiotics. Vancomycin and
      methicillin resistance were observed in 8.5% and 5.4% of S. aureus isolates,
      respectively. Eight methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were found to harbor
      the mecA gene. In conclusion, Listeria spp. was only rarely found in the
      slaughterhouse environment and on beef. Nevertheless, the recovery of L.
      monocytogenes from a water reservoir containing sea water that was used to wash
      carcasses indicates the potential risk of contamination of the carcasses with L. 
      monocytogenes when using sea water. S. aureus was frequently isolated from
      abattoir workers and beef carcasses, and the occurrence of S. aureus differed
      significantly between slaughterhouses. The high occurrence of S. aureus, which
      were often resistant toward different antibiotics, represents a significant
      public health concern.

      of swine Clostridium spp.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2017-0642 [doi]
AB  - The impact of amendment with swine manure compost (SMC), yard waste compost
      (YWC), or food waste compost (FWC) on the abundance of antibiotic resistance
      genes in soil was evaluated. Following a commercial-scale application of the
      composts in a field experiment, soils were sampled periodically for a decade, and
      archived air-dried. Soil DNA was extracted and gene targets quantified by qPCR.
      Compared with untreated control soil, all 3 amendment types increased the
      abundance of gene targets for up to 4 years postapplication. The abundance of
      several gene targets was much higher in soil amended with SMC than in soil
      receiving either YWC or FWC. The gene target ermB remained higher in the SMC
      treatment for a decade postapplication. Clostridia were significantly more
      abundant in the SMC-amended soil throughout the decade following application.
      Eight percent of Clostridium spp. isolates from the SMC treatment carried ermB.
      Overall, addition of organic amendments to soils has the potential to increase
      the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. Amendments of fecal origin, such as
      SMC, will in addition entrain bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes.
      Environmentally recalcitrant clostridia, and the antibiotic resistance genes that
      they carry, will persist for many years under field conditions following the
      application of SMC.

LID - 10.1111/eva.12526 [doi]
AB  - The spread of antimicrobial resistance and global change in air temperature
      represent two major phenomena that are exerting a disastrous impact on natural
      and social issues but investigation of the interaction between these phenomena in
      an evolutionary context is limited. In this study, a statistical genetic approach
      was used to investigate the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in agricultural
      ecosystem and its association with local air temperature, precipitation, and UV
      radiation. We found no resistance to mancozeb, a nonspecific fungicide widely
      used in agriculture for more than half a century, in 215 Alternaria alternata
      isolates sampled from geographic locations along a climatic gradient and cropping
      system representing diverse ecotypes in China, consistent with low resistance
      risk in many nonspecific fungicides. Genetic variance accounts for ~35% of
      phenotypic variation, while genotype-environment interaction is negligible,
      suggesting that heritability plays a more important role in the evolution of
      resistance to mancozeb in plant pathogens than phenotypic plasticity. We also
      found that tolerance to mancozeb in agricultural ecosystem is under constraining 
      selection and significantly associated with local air temperature, possibly
      resulting from a pleiotropic effect of resistance with thermal and other
      ecological adaptations. The implication of these results for fungicide and other 
      antimicrobial management in the context of global warming is discussed.

PG  - 1933-1940
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-091 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio cholerae, a causative agent of the waterborne disease cholera, still
      threatens a large proportion of world's population. The role of biofilm formation
      in V. cholerae pathogenesis is well established, as it provides the bacterium
      enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial agents and increased transmission. In the
      present study, four medicinal plants used in traditional medicines with
      antidiarrheal properties were evaluated for its antibiofilm activity. Methanol
      extracts of these plants (Centella asiatica, Elephantopus scaber, Camellia
      sinensis, and Holarrhena antidysenterica) showed promising antibiofilm activity
      against V. cholerae with crystal violet and air-liquid interface coverslip
      assays. Results revealed that C. asiatica, E. scaber, C. sinensis, and H.
      antidysenterica extracts significantly inhibited biofilm formation by
      approximately 75, 76, 78, and 55% at concentrations of 3, 2, 1, and 0.6 mg/mL,
      respectively. A promising antibiofilm activity of approximately 89% inhibition at
      1.5 mg/mL concentration was observed when a combination of E. scaber and C.
      sinensis was used. The herbal extracts were thermostable at a temperature range
      of 40 to 100 degrees C. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
      bromide assay revealed that the viability of bacteria was not affected by
      treatment with these plant extracts. Gene expression studies revealed that
      extracts of H. antidysenterica leaf, H. antidysenterica bark, and the whole plant
      of E. scaber and C. asiatica down-regulate aphA or aphB, the major regulator
      genes modulating both virulence and biofilm formation. Hence, we propose that
      these herbal combinations could serve as a multifaceted approach to combat the
      pathogen and also, in turn, reduce antimicrobial resistance development.

AB  - Among the genus Streptococcus, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are the major causes
      of pharyngitis, impetigo, pneumonia and meningitis in humans. Streptococcus spp. 
      are facultative anaerobes that are nutritionally fastidious, yet survive in the
      environment and target the predisposed population. Antibacterial disinfectants
      have been partially effective only, indicating the need for novel preventative
      measures and to understand mechanisms of bacterial resistance. Acanthamoeba is a 
      free-living protist that is known to harbour microbial pathogens, provide
      shelter, and assist in their transmission to susceptible population. The overall 
      aim of this study was to determine whether S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae can
      interact with A. castellanii by associating, invading, and surviving inside
      trophozoites and cysts. It was observed that both S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae
      were able to associate as well as invade and/or taken up by the phagocytic A.
      castellanii trophozoite. Notably, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae survived the
      encystation process, avoided phagocytosis, multiplied, and exhibited higher
      recovery from the mature cysts, compared with the trophozoite stage
      (approximately 2 bacteria per amoebae ratio for cyst stage versus 0.02 bacteria
      per amoeba ration for trophozoite stage). As Acanthamoeba cysts are resilient and
      can disperse through the air, A. castellanii can act as a vector in providing
      shelter, facilitating growth and possibly genetic exchanges. In addition, these
      interactions may contribute to S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae survival in harsh
      environments, and transmission to susceptible population and possibly affecting
      their virulence. Future studies will determine the molecular mechanisms
      associated with Acanthamoeba interactions with Streptococcus and the evolution of
      pathogenic bacteria and in turn expedite the discovery of novel therapeutic
      and/or preventative measures.

TI  - Disparate Antibiotic Resistance Gene Quantities Revealed across 4 Major Cities in
      California: A Survey in Drinking Water, Air, and Soil at 24 Public Parks.
PG  - 2255-2263
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.7b00118 [doi]
AB  - Widespread prevalence of multidrug and pandrug-resistant bacteria has prompted
      substantial concern over the global dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes 
      (ARGs). Environmental compartments can behave as genetic reservoirs and hotspots,
      wherein resistance genes can accumulate and be laterally transferred to
      clinically relevant pathogens. In this work, we explore the ARG copy quantities
      in three environmental media distributed across four cities in California and
      demonstrate that there exist city-to-city disparities in soil and drinking water 
      ARGs. Statistically significant differences in ARGs were identified in soil,
      where differences in blaSHV gene copies were the most striking; the highest copy 
      numbers were observed in Bakersfield (6.0 x 10(-2) copies/16S-rRNA gene copies
      and 2.6 x 10(6) copies/g of soil), followed by San Diego (1.8 x 10(-3)
      copies/16S-rRNA gene copies and 3.0 x 10(4) copies/g of soil), Fresno (1.8 x
      10(-5) copies/16S-rRNA gene copies and 8.5 x 10(2) copies/g of soil), and Los
      Angeles (5.8 x 10(-6) copies/16S-rRNA gene copies and 5.6 x 10(2) copies/g of
      soil). In addition, ARG copy numbers in the air, water, and soil of each city are
      contextualized in relation to globally reported quantities and illustrate that
      individual genes are not necessarily predictors for the environmental resistome
      as a whole.

TI  - Riboflavin and pantothenic acid biosynthesis are crucial for iron homeostasis and
      virulence in the pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus.
PG  - 1036-1049
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2018.1482181 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aspergillus fumigatus is the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogen,
      causing invasive fungal infections mainly in immunosuppressed individuals. Death 
      rates from invasive aspergillosis remain high because of limited treatment
      options and increasing antifungal resistance. The aim of this study was to
      identify key fungal-specific genes participating in vitamin B biosynthesis in A. 
      fumigatus. Because these genes are absent in humans they can serve as possible
      novel targets for antifungal drug development. METHODS: By sequence homology we
      identified, deleted and analysed four key A. fumigatus genes (riboB, panA, pyroA,
      thiB) involved respectively in the biosynthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2),
      pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and thiamine (vitamin B1).
      RESULTS: Deletion of riboB, panA, pyroA or thiB resulted in respective vitamin
      auxotrophy. Lack of riboflavin and pantothenic acid biosynthesis perturbed many
      cellular processes including iron homeostasis. Virulence in murine pulmonary and 
      systemic models of infection was severely attenuated following deletion of riboB 
      and panA, strongly reduced after pyroA deletion and weakly attenuated after thiB 
      deletion. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the biosynthetic pathways of the
      vitamins riboflavin and pantothenic acid as attractive targets for novel
      antifungal therapy. Moreover, the virulence studies with auxotrophic mutants
      serve to identify the availability of nutrients to pathogens in host niches.

TI  - Protective and antifungal properties of Nanodisk-Amphotericin B over commercially
      available Amphotericin B.
PG  - 2-8
LID - 10.1016/j.wjorl.2017.01.002 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Amphotericin B (AMB), a potent antifungal agent, has been employed as 
      topical and systemic therapy for sinonasal fungal infections. A novel formulation
      of nanodisc (ND) containing super aggregated AMB (ND-AMB) for the treatment of
      fungal infections has been recently developed to provide greater protection from 
      AMB toxicity than current, clinically approved lipid-based formulations. The
      objective of the current study was to evaluate the safety and potency of ND-AMB
      for sinonasal delivery using an in vitro model. Methods: Human sinonasal tissue
      was harvested during endoscopic sinus surgery and grown at air-liquid interface
      until well-differentiated. Cultures were exposed to ND-AMB vs AMB and changes in 
      K(+) permeability and resistance were measured and recorded via Ussing chamber
      assay. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was analyzed in parallel as well as cytotoxic
      assay. Potency was assessed using real-time PCR measurement of the Aspergillus
      fumigatus 18S rRNA. Results: Ussing chamber studies revealed K(+) currents that
      increased rapidly within 30 s of adding AMB (10 mug/mL) to the apical side,
      indicating apical membranes had become permeable to K(+) ions. In contrast,
      negligible induction of K(+) current was obtained following addition of ND-AMB
      [AMB = (107.7 +/- 15.9) muA/cm(2) AMB vs ND-AMB = (2.3 +/- 0.7) muA/cm(2) ND-AMB;
      P = 0.005]. ND-AMB also protected nasal epithelial cells from cytotoxicity of AMB
      (P < 0.05). There was no difference in ciliary beat frequency between the two
      groups (P = 0.96). The expression of A. fumigatus 18S rRNA with exposure of lower
      dose of ND-AMB was significantly lower compared to that with AMB (P < 0.05).
      Conclusions: Data from the present study suggests ND-AMB protects human nasal
      epithelia membranes from AMB toxicity by protecting against apical cell K(+)
      permeability while maintaining uncompromised antifungal property compared to AMB.
      ND-AMB could provide a novel topical therapy for sinonasal fungal diseases.

TI  - Identification of natural antimicrobial peptides from bacteria through
      metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of high-throughput transcriptome data
      of Taiwanese oolong teas.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/s12918-017-0503-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), naturally encoded by genes and
      generally containing 12-100 amino acids, are crucial components of the innate
      immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria and
      viruses. In recent years, the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the
      rapid growth of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms that often induce critical
      infection and pathogenesis. Recently, the advent of high-throughput technologies 
      has led molecular biology into a data surge in both the amount and scope of data.
      For instance, next-generation sequencing technology has been applied to generate 
      large-scale sequencing reads from foods, water, soil, air, and specimens to
      identify microbiota and their functions based on metagenomics and
      metatranscriptomics, respectively. In addition, oolong tea is partially fermented
      and is the most widely produced tea in Taiwan. Many studies have shown the
      benefits of oolong tea in inhibiting obesity, reducing dental plaque deposition, 
      antagonizing allergic immune responses, and alleviating the effects of aging.
      However, the microbes and their functions present in oolong tea remain unknown.
      RESULTS: To understand the relationship between Taiwanese oolong teas and
      bacterial communities, we designed a novel bioinformatics scheme to identify AMPs
      and their functional types based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analysis 
      of high-throughput transcriptome data. Four types of oolong teas (Dayuling tea,
      Alishan tea, Jinxuan tea, and Oriental Beauty tea) were subjected to 16S
      ribosomal DNA and total RNA extraction and sequencing. Metagenomics analysis
      results revealed that Oriental Beauty tea exhibited greater bacterial diversity
      than other teas. The most common bacterial families across all tea types were
      Bacteroidaceae (21.7%), Veillonellaceae (22%), and Fusobacteriaceae (12.3%).
      Metatranscriptomics analysis results revealed that the dominant bacteria species 
      across all tea types were Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and
      Chryseobacterium sp. StRB126, which were subjected to further functional
      analysis. A total of 8194 (6.5%), 26,220 (6.1%), 5703 (5.8%), and 106,183 (7.8%) 
      reads could be mapped to AMPs. CONCLUSION: We found that the distribution of
      anti-gram-positive and anti-gram-negative AMPs is highly correlated with the
      distribution of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in Taiwanese oolong tea 
      samples.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Assessment of microbial air quality and surface contamination in
      ambulances and administration offices as a control place without occupational
      exposure to biological agents; based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of 
      bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi found in collected samples. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: The sampling was done by wet cyclone technology using the Coriolis recon
      apparatus, imprint and swab methods, respectively. In total, 280 samples from 28 
      ambulances and 10 offices in Warszawa were tested. Data was analyzed using
      Shapiro-Wilk normality test, Kruskal-Wallis test with alpha = 0.05. P value </=
      0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: The levels of air contamination were
      from 0 to 2.3x10<sup>1</sup> colony-forming unit (CFU)/m<sup>3</sup> for bacteria
      and for yeast and filamentous fungi were from 0 to 1.8x10<sup>1</sup>
      CFU/m<sup>3</sup>. The assessment of office space air samples has shown the
      following numbers of microorganisms: bacteria from 3.0x10<sup>1</sup> to
      4.2x10<sup>1</sup> CFU/m<sup>3</sup> and yeast and filamentous fungi from 0 to
      1.9x10<sup>1</sup> CFU/m<sup>3</sup>. For surface contamination the mean
      bacterial count in ambulances has been between 1.0x10<sup>1</sup> and
      1.3x10<sup>2</sup> CFU/25 cm<sup>2</sup> and in offices - between
      1.1x10<sup>1</sup> and 8.5x10<sup>1</sup> CFU/25 cm<sup>2</sup>. Mean fungal
      count has reached the level from 2.8x10<sup>0</sup> to 4.2x10<sup>1</sup> CFU/25 
      cm<sup>2</sup> in ambulances and 1.3x10<sup>1</sup> to 5.8x10<sup>1</sup> CFU/25 
      cm<sup>2</sup> in offices. The qualitative analysis has revealed the presence of 
      Acinetobacter spp. (surfaces), coagulase - negative Staphylococci (air and
      surfaces), Aspergillus and Penicillium genera (air and surfaces). CONCLUSIONS:
      The study has revealed a satisfactory microbiological quantity of analyzed air
      and surface samples in both study and control environments. However, the presence
      of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the air and on surfaces in ambulances
      may endanger the medical emergency staff and patients with infection.
      Disinfection and cleaning techniques therefore should be constantly developed and
      implemented. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017;30(4):617-627.

TI  - Esophageal pulmonary fistula - a rare complication of radiation therapy: a case
      report.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s13256-018-1658-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophageal respiratory fistulae are abnormal communications between
      the esophagus and the respiratory system. They are either congenital or acquired.
      Most acquired esophageal respiratory fistulae are of the esophageal tracheal and 
      esophageal bronchial type and are caused by infections or malignant neoplasms,
      whereas esophageal pulmonary fistulae are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a
      case of a 72-year-old Caucasian man with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
      presenting with abrupt-onset dyspnea during localized mediastinal radiotherapy.
      His laboratory test results suggested major respiratory infection. A chest x-ray 
      revealed left apical lung radiopacity along with excavated lesions, consistent
      with secondary tumor infection. No clinical improvement was observed despite
      antibiotic treatment. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the chest 
      confirmed persistent lung infection with unfavorable progression and air in the
      mediastinum; the latter suggested a fistula from the upper third of the esophagus
      to the upper left pulmonary lobe. Videofluoroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of an 
      acquired esophageal pulmonary fistula. The patient underwent endoscopy, and an
      esophageal self-expandable metallic stent was deployed. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal
      pulmonary fistulae must be suspected whenever patients undergoing local
      mediastinal radiotherapy present with acute pulmonary complications, particularly
      pneumonia resistant to antibiotic treatment. Esophageal pulmonary fistulae are
      diagnosed by means of radiological imaging. Because esophageal respiratory
      fistulae are acute life-threatening conditions, prompt treatment with an
      endoscopically placed covered stent proves vital.

TI  - Emphysematous endocarditis caused by AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia
      coli: A case report.
PG  - e9620
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000009620 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening disease, mostly
      caused by gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria were identified as a
      causative organism in relatively small number of cases. Although,
      antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli is common cause of gram-negative
      endocarditis, AmpC beta-lactamase (BL)-harboring E coli is very rare cause of IE.
      Furthermore, emphysematous endocarditis is also a very rare manifestation of E
      coli infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of 80-year-old female patient 
      presenting with dizziness, fever, and altered mental status, who was finally
      diagnosed with emphysematous endocarditis caused by E coli harboring an AmpC BL
      gene. DIAGNOSIS: Her chest computed tomography revealed air bubbles surrounding
      the annulus of a mitral valve and a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a
      hyperechogenic mass fixed on the posteromedial side of the mitral annulus with 2 
      eccentric mitral regurgitation jets. Blood cultures grew E coli which harbored
      the DHA-type AmpC BL. The organism belonged to a B2 phylogenic group, and
      multilocus sequence typing analyses revealed that the strains were of ST-95.
      INTERVENTIONS: She was treated with meropenem following the resistant profiles,
      and surgery was recommended by the healthcare professional, but denied by the
      patient's guardians. She was transferred to another hospital due to a refusal for
      further treatment. LESSONS: Emphysematous endocarditis is an uncommon
      complication of E coli bacteremia. Certain phylogenetic groups may be associated 
      with development of E coli endocarditis.

TI  - A demonstration of the antimicrobial effectiveness of various copper surfaces.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/1754-1611-7-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination on touch surfaces results in increased risk
      of infection. In the last few decades, work has been done on the antimicrobial
      properties of copper and its alloys against a range of micro-organisms
      threatening public health in food processing, healthcare and air conditioning
      applications; however, an optimum copper method of surface deposition and mass
      structure has not been identified. RESULTS: A proof-of-concept study of the
      disinfection effectiveness of three copper surfaces was performed. The surfaces
      were produced by the deposition of copper using three methods of thermal spray,
      namely, plasma spray, wire arc spray and cold spray The surfaces were then
      inoculated with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). After a two
      hour exposure to the surfaces, the surviving MRSA were assayed and the results
      compared.The differences in the copper depositions produced by the three thermal 
      spray methods were examined in order to explain the mechanism that causes the
      observed differences in MRSA killing efficiencies. The cold spray deposition
      method was significantly more effective than the other methods. It was determined
      that work hardening caused by the high velocity particle impacts created by the
      cold spray technique results in a copper microstructure that enhances ionic
      diffusion, and copper ions are principally responsible for antimicrobial
      activity. CONCLUSIONS: This test showed significant microbiologic differences
      between coatings produced by different spray techniques and demonstrates the
      importance of the copper application technique. The cold spray technique shows
      superior anti-microbial effectiveness caused by the high impact velocity imparted
      to the sprayed particles which results in high dislocation density and high ionic
      diffusivity.

TI  - Antibiotic usage and its sensitivity pattern in the NICU.
PG  - 27-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in newborns
      affecting both developed and developing countries accounting a quarter around one
      million deaths per annum. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess the
      prevalence of neonatal sepsis, culture isolates, pattern, antibiotic sensitivity 
      and drug prescribing pattern. METHODS: In present prospective study, 48 neonates 
      admitted in pediatric ward from January to March 2011 of Dhulikhel Hospital were 
      included. The gestation age, onset of sepsis, culture isolates, antibiotic
      sensitivity pattern and drug prescribing pattern were studied. Environmental air 
      sampling of NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) was done by settle plate method
      for microbial examination. RESULT: Among 48 neonates, 23 (47.92%) neonates were
      culture positive with predominant isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca 11(47.83%),
      Pseudomonas sp. 4(17.39%), Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)
      3(13.04%) and single case of Enterobacter spp. In environmental samples, K.
      oxytoca and Enterobacter sp. were isolated. Amikacin, Imepeneum and Ciprofloxacin
      were sensitive whereas Ampicillin in combination with Cloxacillin, Ampicillin,
      Aztreonam were resistant for Klebsiella. oxytoca. Amikacin, Ceftazidime and
      Imipenuem were sensitive to Enterobacter spp. The single or combinations of
      resistant antibiotics were found to be prescribed. CONCLUSION: The emerging
      antibiotic resistances among the culture isolates and coherence with
      environmental samples were observed. Hence, special measures are imperative for
      reducing environmental contamination and the rational usage of antibiotics for
      preventing the infection and emerging antibiotic resistance. The study recommends
      need of the antibiotic policy to curb the present scenario.

TI  - Adenoviral pneumonia in children.
PG  - 112-8
AB  - This report reviews the manifestations in fifteen children of proved adenoviral
      pneumonia. Patients' ages ranged from 43 days to 4 years and 1 month. Twelve
      cases were younger than 2 years old. Adenoviral infections were proved by
      positive viral cultures or a four-fold increase of the complement fixation titer.
      Prolonged fever and cough were found in all cases. In 13 patients, respiratory
      distress occurred; 5 needed mechanical ventilation. Injected throats,
      conjunctivae and ear drums were common. Other clinical pictures included
      abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, skin rash, convulsion and bleeding tendency. 
      Abnormal laboratory findings were mild anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,
      elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, impaired liver
      function test, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.
      Anemia (11 cases), leukopenia (7 cases) and elevated transaminases levels (7
      cases) were more common than previously reported. All patients had para-hilar
      peribronchial infiltrates in chest roentgenography. Segmental atelectasis and
      compensated hyper-expansion were found frequently. Pleural effusion were noted in
      six of our cases. Air leak syndrome occurred in three patients who had received
      mechanical ventilation. Three of the 15 patients expired: one had a preceding
      measles infection, all had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. For patients 
      with antibiotic-resistant pneumonia, adenoviral studies should be done.
      Extrapulmonary manifestations, and some abnormal laboratory findings, i.e., mild 
      anemia, leukopenia, impaired liver function are clues to adenoviral infections,
      while bleeding tendency can be regarded as a poor prognostic sign for children
      with adenoviral pneumonia.

TI  - Whole metagenome profiles of particulates collected from the International Space 
      Station.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.1186/s40168-017-0292-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The built environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is a
      highly specialized space in terms of both physical characteristics and habitation
      requirements. It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure
      to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally,
      astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial
      composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional
      genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on
      human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized. METHODS:
      This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species- and
      gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and
      compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment.
      Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant,
      virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select
      cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome
      and compared. RESULTS: Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be
      largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity
      being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining
      detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial
      resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant
      gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level 
      cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus
      showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. CONCLUSION:
      Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and
      cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily
      reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable
      microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed
      environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation.
      Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the
      conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments.

AB  - Thymus species are well known as medicinal plants because of their biological and
      pharmacological properties. Thymus caramanicus is an endemic species grown in
      Iran. Variation in the quantity and quality of the essential oil of wild
      population of T. caramanicus at different phenological stages including
      vegetative, floral budding, flowering and seed set are reported. The oils of
      air-dried samples were obtained by hydrodistillation. The yields of oils (w/w%)
      at different stages were in the order of: flowering (2.5%), floral budding
      (2.1%), seed set (2.0%) and vegetative (1.9%). The oils were analyzed by GC and
      GC-MS. In total 37, 37, 29 and 35 components were identified and quantified in
      vegetative, floral budding, full flowering and seed set, representing 99.3, 98.6,
      99.2 and 97.8% of the oil, respectively. Carvacrol was the major compound in all 
      samples. The ranges of major constituents were as follow: carvacrol (58.9-68.9%),
      p-cymene (3.0-8.9%), gamma-terpinene (4.3-8.0%), thymol (2.4-6.0%) and borneol
      (2.3-4.0%). Antibacterial activity of the oils and their main compounds were
      tested against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by disc diffusion
      method and determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. The
      inhibition zones (IZ) and MIC values for bacterial strains, which were sensitive 
      to the essential oil of T. caramanicus, were in the range of 15-36mm and
      0.5-15.0mg/ml, respectively. The oils of various phenological stages showed high 
      activity against all tested bacteria, of which Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa were the most sensitive and resistant strains, respectively. Thus,
      they represent an inexpensive source of natural antibacterial substances that
      exhibited potential for use in pathogenic systems.

AB  - Disseminated Candida albicans infection results in high morbidity and mortality
      despite treatment with existing antifungal drugs. Recent studies suggest that
      modulating the host immune response can improve survival, but specific host
      targets for accomplishing this goal remain to be identified. The extracellular
      matrix protein thrombospondin-1 is released at sites of tissue injury and
      modulates several immune functions, but its role in C. albicans pathogenesis has 
      not been investigated. Here, we show that mice lacking thrombospondin-1 have an
      advantage in surviving disseminated candidiasis and more efficiently clear the
      initial colonization from kidneys despite exhibiting fewer infiltrating
      leukocytes. By examining local and systemic cytokine responses to C. albicans and
      other standard inflammatory stimuli, we identify a crucial function of phagocytes
      in this enhanced resistance. Subcutaneous air pouch and systemic candidiasis
      models demonstrated that endogenous thrombospondin-1 enhances the early innate
      immune response against C. albicans and promotes activation of inflammatory
      macrophages (inducible nitric oxide synthase(+), IL-6(high), TNF-alpha(high),
      IL-10(low)), release of the chemokines MIP-2, JE, MIP-1alpha, and RANTES, and
      CXCR2-driven polymorphonuclear leukocytes recruitment. However, thrombospondin-1 
      inhibited the phagocytic capacity of inflammatory leukocytes in vivo and in
      vitro, resulting in increased fungal burden in the kidney and increased mortality
      in wild type mice. Thus, thrombospondin-1 enhances the pathogenesis of
      disseminated candidiasis by creating an imbalance in the host immune response
      that ultimately leads to reduced phagocytic function, impaired fungal clearance, 
      and increased mortality. Conversely, inhibitors of thrombospondin-1 may be useful
      drugs to improve patient recovery from disseminated candidiasis.

TI  - Molecular epidemiological analysis and microbial source tracking of Salmonella

PG  - 115-26
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2007.0029 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological studies were conducted to source track and delineate horizontal
      transmission pathways of Salmonella serovars in a turkey production environment. 
      Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (n = 111), Salmonella Senftenberg (n =
      14), Salmonella Muenster (n = 10), unidentifiable "roughs" (n = 5), Salmonella
      Anatum (n = 3), and Salmonella Worthington (n = 2) were isolated from the birds' 
      cecal and crop contents, litter, environmental swabs, drinkers, and feed samples.
      These strains (n = 145) were analyzed for their antimicrobial susceptibility
      profiles and the bacterial horizontal transmission pathways were tracked by
      XbaI-digested pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) macrorestriction profiles. 
      Nearly 79% of the strains were resistant to one or more antimicrobials, while 44%
      of the strains were resistant to two to six antimicrobials. Nearly 21% of the
      strains were susceptible to all of the antimicrobials tested. Twenty-seven
      distinct PFGE fingerprint profiles (90-95% similarity) were observed among 110
      Salmonella Heidelberg strains (one strain was untypeable), and 13 of the 27
      profiles (48%) elicited 100% similarity among the fingerprint patterns. The
      prevalence of Salmonella Heidelberg strains at weeks 2 (n = 20), 10 (n = 20), and
      18 (n = 70) among the sampled pens suggested cross-colonization among pens during
      the 20-week production cycle. Salmonella Heidelberg strains were first isolated
      from the birds at week 2, and identical fingerprint profiles of this serovar were
      subsequently isolated from birds within the same pen; birds in other pens; and
      litter, air, and swab samples at weeks 10 and 18, suggesting possible horizontal 
      transmission of this serovar across the production facility during the grow-out
      period.

TI  - [ 771 Shigella strains isolated in a 15-year period from Americans living in
      Ankara. Comparisons with Shigella strains isolated from Turkish natives].
PG  - 473-99
AB  - The author had worked as a bacteriologist in Ankara American Air Force Hospital
      from 1958 to 1972. During this period of time he was able to isolate 771 shigella
      strains from the American patients of the hospital. The amounts and the
      percentages of the subgroups are listed below together with the two other Ankara 
      City Pediatric hospital results (see article). american community lived in Ankara
      for 15 years and shared many aspects which were important in shigella
      epidemiology like using city's tap water, shopping from the same green groceries 
      to by fruits and vegetables so on. For shigella cases Ankara had seasonal
      alterations in July and August being the peak months. Americans, disease followed
      that course exactly. The big difference was being the local people of the city
      had those epidemics with the flexneri strains but Americans had them with the
      sonnei strains. To show the possible sources which could infect the community
      time to time and make sonnei predominant yielded negative result. All the
      patients stools were cultured. Sensitivity studies employing "plate disk
      diffusion" techniques were done. All patients treated accordingly. Stools checked
      for routine carriership exams. None become a chronic carrier. American
      installations had their shops, clubs, mess halls. The food handlers of these
      places had checked routinely by the preventive medicine office. None found
      infected. Only at 1963 the amount of flexneri isolations were higher than sonnei.
      All the remaining years sonnei were predominant. Antibiotic sensitivity studies
      showed no differences between subtypes. Except streptomycin and sulphamide
      strains stayed fairly sensitive to other antibiotics. Resistance factors
      contained maximum 6 markers. The little Americans community in Ankara consisted a
      unique and highly socioeconomic-wise developed group of the city. Many attempts
      to find the answer for the question is "who is infecting who" was always
      fruitless. That gives the impression as if the Americans were more sensitive to
      the shigella infections caused by sonnei strains for some reason. In another
      words Americans were more resistant to the infections other than sonnei.

TI  - Low-level laser therapy to the mouse femur enhances the fungicidal response of
      neutrophils against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.
PG  - e0003541
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003541 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophils (PMN) play a central role in host defense against the neglected
      fungal infection paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), which is caused by the dimorphic
      fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb). PCM is of major importance, especially
      in Latin America, and its treatment relies on the use of antifungal drugs.
      However, the course of treatment is lengthy, leading to side effects and even
      development of fungal resistance. The goal of the study was to use low-level
      laser therapy (LLLT) to stimulate PMN to fight Pb in vivo. Swiss mice with
      subcutaneous air pouches were inoculated with a virulent strain of Pb or fungal
      cell wall components (Zymosan), and then received LLLT (780 nm; 50 mW; 12.5
      J/cm2; 30 seconds per point, giving a total energy of 0.5 J per point) on
      alternate days at two points on each hind leg. The aim was to reach the bone
      marrow in the femur with light. Non-irradiated animals were used as controls. The
      number and viability of the PMN that migrated to the inoculation site was
      assessed, as well as their ability to synthesize proteins, produce reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and their fungicidal activity. The highly pure PMN
      populations obtained after 10 days of infection were also subsequently cultured
      in the presence of Pb for trials of protein production, evaluation of
      mitochondrial activity, ROS production and quantification of viable fungi growth.
      PMN from mice that received LLLT were more active metabolically, had higher
      fungicidal activity against Pb in vivo and also in vitro. The kinetics of
      neutrophil protein production also correlated with a more activated state. LLLT
      may be a safe and non-invasive approach to deal with PCM infection.

TI  - Fungal infections of the eye--laboratory diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 48-63
AB  - Infections of the eye give rise to severe ocular morbidity and blindness include 
      keratitis, orbital cellulites, endophthalmitis and dacryocystitis. Corneal
      blindness, in developing countries is predominantly associated with infections.
      In India, nearly 30-35% of all culture positive infectious keratitis are caused
      fungi. Laboratory diagnosis mainly depends upon proper collection and transport
      of clinical specimens. In fungal keratitis, corneal scraping is the ideal sample,
      but occasionally corneal biopsy or anterior chamber aspirate may also be needed. 
      Corneal scraping is usually by Kimura spatula, under a slit lamp examination,
      after anaesthetizing the cornea with topical anaesthetic like 0.4% proparcaine.
      Corneal biopsy is done by a minor trephining and AC aspirate using a sterile
      tuberculin syringe. In case of endophthalmitis, 150-200 il of aqueous humour is
      collected. Vitreous fluid (500-1000 il), however, is collected by pars plana
      vitrectomy onto sterile tuberculin syringe, the needle is then fixed to a sterile
      rubber bung after expelling air from the syringe. The collected sample is
      immediately transported to the laboratory. Swabs from the regurgitating lacrimnal
      sacs and wound aspirate/swabs are the ideal specimens for dacryocystitis and
      orbital cellulites, respectively. These samples are cultured onto SDA slants
      following standard procedures. The main draw back of culture is its long
      incubation time (5 to 14 days), though it is indispensable from the view point of
      the specificity. Direct examination (KOH wet mount, Gram's, Giemsa or calcofluor 
      fluorescent staining methods) of the specimen, however, is quick and immensely
      helpful for ophthalmologist. The newer rapid methods, such as molecular
      techniques are also available and the management of patients can be according to 
      the results obtained. With the advent of novel antifungal agents such as newer
      azoles and cell wall acting antifungals like echinocandins, the clinician has the
      wider option of selecting the therapeutic modality. In the event of the
      increasing reports of in vitro drug resistance to much frequently used azoles,
      polyenes and 5-fluorocytosines, clinical applicability of the newer antifungal
      agents seems to be quite promising.

TI  - Analyses of the red-dry-rough phenotype of an Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain and
      its role in biofilm formation and resistance to antibacterial agents.
PG  - 2564-72
AB  - In a previous study, we identified Congo red-binding and -nonbinding phase
      variants of Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 strain ATCC 43895. The Congo
      red-binding variant, strain 43895OR, produced a dry, aggregative colony that was 
      similar to the red, dry, and rough (rdar) phenotype characteristic of certain
      strains of Salmonella. In contrast, variant 43895OW produced a smooth and white
      colony morphology. In this study, we show that, similar to rdar strains of
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, strain 43895OR forms large aggregates in
      broth cultures, firm pellicles at the air-medium interface on glass, and dense
      biofilms on glass and polystyrene. However, unlike S. enterica serovar
      Typhimurium, strain 43895OR does not stain positive for cellulose production.
      When strain 43895OR was fixed on agar, scanning electron microscopy showed cells 
      expressing extracellular matrix (ECM) containing curli fibers. Strain 43895OW was
      devoid of any ECM or curli fibers on agar but showed expression of curli fibers
      during attachment to glass. Strain 43895OR produced >4-fold-larger amounts of
      biofilm than strain 43895OW on polystyrene, glass, stainless steel, and Teflon;
      formation was >3-fold higher in rich medium than in nutrient-limited medium.
      Biofilm-associated cells of both strains showed statistically greater resistance 
      (P < 0.05) to hydrogen peroxide and quaternary ammonium sanitizer than their
      respective planktonic cells. This study shows that the rdar phenotype of E. coli 
      O157:H7 strain 43895OR is important in multicellular growth, biofilm formation,
      and resistance to sanitizers. However, the lack of cellulose production by strain
      43895OR indicates important differences in the ECM composition compared to that
      of Salmonella.

TI  - Small intestine bacterial overgrowth in irritable bowel syndrome: a retrospective
      study with rifaximin.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - AIM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequent diagnosis in gastroenterology, 
      but it is now clear that an altered dynamic equilibrium and bacterial overgrowth 
      in the small intestine may mimic an IBS-like syndrome. METHODS: We have,
      therefore, evaluated the real prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
      (SIBO) by retrospectively examining the glucose hydrogen (H(2)) breath test in 96
      patients with a previous symptoms-based IBS diagnosis. Moreover, we wished to
      evaluate the efficacy of the locally acting antibiotic rifaximin in eradicating a
      SIBO syndrome. RESULTS: The breath test showed a SIBO syndrome in 44 out 96 IBS
      patients (45.8%), who had H(2) peaks in the expired air higher than 10 ppm over
      the baseline value (mean: 36.2+/-18.7 ppm). All these patients were treated with 
      rifaximin (1 200 mg/day for 14 days) followed by a twenty-day cycle of
      probiotics. Twenty-three of them returned to a control visit within 4-5 months:
      the glucose breath test became negative in 19 cases (82.6%; P<0.01) and mean peak
      value of H(2) significantly decreased from 40.9+/-20.4 to 4.78+/-8.42 ppm
      (P<0.001). Patients reported also a substantial improvement of the IBS symptoms. 
      No adverse effect was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a SIBO syndrome 
      is present in about half of patients with an IBS diagnosis and, therefore, it
      should always be suspected in these patients. Moreover, the use of broad-spectrum
      non absorbable antibiotics, such as rifaximin, represents a safe and effective
      approach to SIBO with a low risk of causing microbial resistance.

TI  - In vitro susceptibility of Candida albicans to four disinfectants and their
      combinations.
PG  - 421-9
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of seven strains of
      Candida albicans to four disinfectants: iodine potassium iodide, chlorhexidine
      acetate, sodium hypochlorite and calcium hydroxide. In addition, all possible
      pairs of the disinfectants were tested in order to compare the effect of the
      combination and its components. METHODOLOGY: Filter paper discs were immersed in 
      standardized yeast suspensions and then transferred to disinfectant solutions of 
      different concentrations and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 s, 5 min, 1 h and
      24 h. After incubation the filter paper discs were transferred to vials with PBS 
      and glass beads that were then vigorously shaken for dispersal of the yeast
      cells. PBS with resuspended yeasts was serially diluted 10-fold. Droplets of 25
      microL from each dilution were inoculated on TSB agar plates and incubated in air
      at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The number of colony-forming units was then calculated 
      from appropriate dilutions. RESULTS: C. albicans cells were highly resistant to
      calcium hydroxide. Sodium hypochlorite (5% and 0.5%) and iodine (2%) potassium
      iodide (4%) killed all yeast cells within 30 s, whilst chlorhexidine acetate
      (0.5%) showed complete killing after 5 min. Combinations of disinfectants were
      equally or less effective than the more effective component. All C. albicans
      strains tested showed similar susceptibility to the medicaments tested.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that sodium hypochlorite, iodine potassium
      iodide and chlorhexidine acetate are more effective than calcium hydroxide
      against C. albicans in vitro. However, combining calcium hydroxide with sodium
      hypochlorite or chlorhexidine may provide a wide-spectrum antimicrobial
      preparation with a long-lasting effect.

TI  - Low incidence of sepsis due to viridans streptococci in a ten-year retrospective 
      study of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 765-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and particularly viridans group
      streptococci (VGS) sepsis. The present study, conducted between 1993 and 2003 in 
      children with AML, sought to assess the frequency and characteristics of
      infectious complications (ICs), the incidence of VGS sepsis, the interest of
      preventive decontamination, and a possible cytarabine dose-effect on the
      occurrence of ICs. METHODS: Medical charts of 78 children treated according to
      the EORTC 58921 clinical trial were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were
      isolated in laminar air flow rooms, received non-absorbable gut decontamination, 
      gum decontamination with vancomycin mouthwash, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole.
      ICs were categorized as microbiologically documented infections (MDI), clinically
      documented infections (CDI), or fever of unknown origin (FUO). RESULTS: Overall, 
      268 ICs occurred: 57.5% FUO, 8.5% CDI, and 34% MDI. Bloodstream infections
      occurred in 58 febrile episodes: Gram-positive bacteria represented 83% of the
      pathogens including 66.1% Staphylococcus species and 8.5% Streptococcus species
      (6.8% VGS), Gram-negative bacteria represented 13.5% of the pathogens and yeasts 
      3.5%. Five patients died of infection (6.4%). None died from bacterial infection 
      and no case of VGS sepsis required intensive care. Invasive fungal infection was 
      proven in four patients. Number of ICs was significantly different according to
      gum and gut decontamination status, and according to the cytarabine dose during
      the first intensification. No resistant strains were detected in spite of the use
      of local antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The low rate of VGS and enterobacteriaceae
      sepsis was probably due to the effective decontamination. Our supportive care
      strategy could potentially help enhance overall survival in children with AML.

TI  - Computed tomographic scan of the chest, latex agglutination test and plasma
      (1AE3)-beta-D-glucan assay in early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary
      aspergillosis: a prospective study of 215 patients.
PG  - 745-52
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Blood and radiologic tests are frequently used for
      diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but it remains unknown which is
      more useful for its early diagnosis. Aim of the study was to compare usefulness
      of computed tomographic (CT) scan of chest, latex agglutination (LA) test and
      determination of plasma (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) levels for early diagnosis of
      invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). DESIGN AND METHODS: We treated 215
      consecutive patients who underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy. From initiation of
      chemotherapy until death or discharge, blood samples were taken weekly and
      subjected to LA and BDG tests. We performed chest CT scans when patients had any 
      signs of pulmonary infection or an antibiotic-resistant fever. RESULTS: Of the
      215 patients, 30 (14. 0%) were diagnosed as having IPA. In sixteen cases the
      diagnosis was definite and in 14 it was suspected. In patient-based analysis,
      sensitivities of LA and BDG were 44% and 63%, respectively. Sensitivity tended to
      be lower in patients with IPA localized to the lung than those with disseminated 
      invasive aspergillosis. Specificities were 93% and 74%, respectively. Either a
      halo or an air-crescent was observed in 7 of the 16 patients with IPA, and all of
      the IPA patients showed some abnormal signs on chest CT scans. On average, CT
      scan signs preceded a positive LA test by 7.1 days and a positive BDG assay by
      11.5 days. In 6 of the 11 patients who became positive for either LA or BDG
      assay, CT scan signs preceded the positive results by more than seven days.
      INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT scan is more beneficial than the blood
      tests and X-ray for early diagnosis of IPA.

TI  - Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC).
PG  - 299-316
AB  - Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) cause aerosacculitis, polyserositis,
      septicemia and other mainly extraintestinal diseases in chickens, turkeys and
      other avian species. APEC are found in the intestinal microflora of healthy birds
      and most of the diseases associated with them are secondary to environmental and 
      host predisposing factors. APEC isolates commonly belong to certain serogroups,
      O1, O2 and O78, and to a restricted number of clones. Several experimental models
      have been developed, permitting a more reliable evaluation of the pathogenicity
      of E. coli for chickens and turkeys. Hence, virulence factors identified on APEC 
      are adhesins such as the F1 and P fimbriae, and curli, the aerobactin iron
      sequestering system, K1 capsule, temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin (Tsh),
      resistance to the bactericidal effects of serum and cytotoxic effects.
      Experimental infection studies have shown that the air-exchange regions of the
      lung and the airsacs are important sites of entry of E. coli into the bloodstream
      of birds during the initial stages of infection and that resistance to
      phagocytosis may be an important mechanism in the development of the disease.
      They have also demonstrated that F1 fimbriae are expressed in the respiratory
      tract, whereas P fimbriae are expressed in the internal organs of infected
      chickens. The role of these fimbrial adhesins in the development of disease is
      not yet, however, fully understood. The more recent use of genetic approaches for
      the identification of new virulence factors will greatly enhance our knowledge of
      APEC pathogenic mechanisms. Diagnosis of APEC infections is based on the clinical
      picture, lesions and isolation of E. coli. This may be strengthened by serotyping
      and identification of virulence factors using immunological or molecular methods 
      such as DNA probes and PCR. Approaches for the prevention and control of APEC
      infections include the control of environmental contamination and environmental
      parameters such as humidity and ventilation. Antibiotherapy is widely used,
      although APEC are frequently resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. Vaccines
      containing killed or attenuated virulent bacteria protect against infection with 
      the homologous strain but are less efficient against heterologous strains. Hence,
      vaccination for colibacillosis is not widely practised because of the large
      variety of serogroups involved in field outbreaks.

AB  - The rapid expansion of human activity in a region can exacerbate human health
      risks induced by antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Peri-urban ecosystems serve 
      at the symbiotic interface between urban and rural ecosystems, and investigations
      into the dissemination of ARGs in peri-urban areas provide a basic framework for 
      tracking the spread of ARGs and potential mitigations. In this study, through the
      use of high-throughput quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput
      sequencing, seasonal and geographical distributions of ARGs and their host
      bacterial communities were characterized in a peri-urban river. The abundance of 
      ARGs in downstream was 5.2-33.9 times higher than upstream, which indicated
      distinct antibiotic resistance pollution in the areas where human lives. With the
      comparison classified based on land use nearby, the abundance of ARGs in samples 
      near farmland and villages was higher than in the background (3.47-5.58 times),
      pointing to the high load in the river caused by farming and other human
      activities in the peri-urban areas. With the co-occurrence pattern revealed by
      network analysis, blaVEB and tetM were proposed to be indicators of ARGs which
      get together in the same module. Furthermore, seasonal variations in ARGs and the
      transport of bacterial communities were observed. The effects of seasonal
      temperature on the dissemination of ARGs along the watershed was also evaluated. 
      The highest absolute abundance of ARGs occurred in summer (2.81x10(9)copies/L on 
      average), the trends of ARG abundances in four seasons were similar with local
      air temperature. The Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) suggested
      that nine bacterial genera were implicated as biomarkers for the corresponding
      season. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) showed significant positive correlation
      with ARGs (P<0.01) and MGEs were also identified as the key-contributing factor
      driving ARG alteration. This study provides an overview of seasonal and
      geographical variations in ARGs distribution in a peri-urban river and draws
      attention to controlling pollutants in peri-urban ecosystems.

AB  - REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Bronchopneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi is an
      important disease of young horses throughout the world. Although early diagnosis 
      and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of
      antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance
      developing. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the level of
      resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus
      equi isolates. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of archived samples. METHODS: Virulent
      Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically
      affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc
      diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration
      (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin
      using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. RESULTS: Resistance to rifampicin
      was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both
      methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64 mug/ml (n = 2) and 16 mug/ml (n = 1). 
      All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125 mug/ml, which was the limit
      of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, 
      there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No
      isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values
      ranging between 0.25 and 2 mug/ml for neomycin and 0.125-1 mug/ml for
      erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination
      relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will
      reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that 
      the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research
      will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn
      reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance. Ethical animal
      research: All organisms in this study were received by the laboratory from
      diagnostic accessions. Sources of funding: Funding for the study was provided by 
      Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and the University of
      Melbourne. G. Herbert was the recipient of a RN McCarthy scholarship from the
      Faculty of Veterinary Science. Competing interests: None declared.

TI  - Limited treatment with beta-1,3/1,6-glucan improves production values of broiler 
      chickens challenged with Escherichia coli.
PG  - 613-8
AB  - The development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led to a need for
      alternatives to antibiotics for growth promotion and disease prevention in
      poultry production. The helical polysaccharide beta-1,3/1,6-glucan is derived
      from the cell wall of Saccharomyces cervisiae and has immunomodulating
      activities. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of 2
      supplementation programs with a commercial beta-1,3/1,6-glucan product to protect
      broiler chicks from experimental respiratory challenge with Escherichia coli.
      Chicks were housed in battery-brooders from 1 d of age and fed a standard starter
      diet or the same diet containing 20 g/ton (22 ppm) of purified
      beta-1,3/1,6-glucan either continuously (BG25d) or for only the first 7 d prior
      to challenge (BG7d). At d 7 one-half of the birds were inoculated in the thoracic
      air sac with 800 cfu of a serotype O2, nonmotile strain of E. coli. All surviving
      birds were necropsied at d 25. Body weight of survivors and feed conversion
      efficiency were protected from the adverse effects of E. coli challenge by BG7d
      but not by BG25d. Mortality was nominally decreased from 63% (control) to 53% in 
      BG25d and 47% in BG7d, but these decreases were not significant. The relative
      weights of the liver and heart were increased, and the bursa of Fabricius
      relative weights were decreased by E. coli challenge, and these effects were
      modulated by beta-glucan treatment. Despite positive effects of BG7d in E.
      coli-challenged birds, the BW of nonchallenged birds was decreased by BG7d and
      BG25d. These results suggest that supplementation of broiler diets with
      beta-1,3/1,6-glucan may be valuable for decreasing production losses due to E.
      coli respiratory disease, but that the immune stimulation provided may also
      result in decreased production values under experimental battery conditions or
      for birds raised in an environment with minimal disease challenges.

TI  - Resistance profile survey of 50 periodontal strains of Actinobacillus
      actinomyectomcomitans.
PG  - 888-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance has been increasingly described among bacterial
      species colonizing periodontal pockets, particularly in Prevotella and
      Porphyromonas spp. strains producing beta-lactamases, and frequently associated
      with resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin. These resistance genes may be
      carried on motile genetic elements, or transposons, capable of interspecies and
      intergeneric transmission among bacterial strains colonizing a same ecological
      niche. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the resistance profile 
      of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the prevalence of A.
      actinomycetemcomitans strains producing beta-lactamases in periodontal pockets.
      METHODS: Fifty strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans were isolated from 42 patients
      with adult periodontitis. No patient had periodontal or antibiotic therapy in the
      previous 6 months. Bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets > or
      =5 mm, appropriately diluted, inoculated onto selective medium (chocolate blood
      agar with bacitracin 75 microg/ml and vancomycin 5 microm/ml) and incubated for 5
      days at 37 degrees C in air with 5% CO2. After conventional identification,
      susceptibility testing to 11 antibiotics was performed by the broth dilution
      method, in trypticase soy broth supplemented with yeast extract, hemin, and 0.1% 
      NaHCO3 to maintain microaerophilic conditions in the microtitration plate wells
      by CO2 formation. RESULTS: No strain demonstrated resistance to amoxicillin,
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination, pristinamycin, or ciprofloxacin at the
      breakpoint, but 40% of the strains were slightly resistant to penicillin G, and
      4% were resistant to erythromycin, 90% to spiramycin, 18% to clarythromycin, 4%
      to tetracycline, 72% to metronidazole, and 12% to ornidazole. Amoxicillin,
      followed by tetracycline and erythromycin, was the most effective antibiotic on
      A. actinomycetemcomitans. The phenotypic research of a beta-lactamase was
      negative for all the strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, most A.
      actinomycetemcomitans strains were resistant to metronidazole, but the
      amoxicillin-metronidazole association may be of interest against subgingival
      anaerobic and capnophilic mixed flora. Pristinamycin and ciprofloxacin appeared
      as effective alternative monotherapies against A. actinomycetemcomitans. The
      threat of beta-lactam antibiotic resistance related to beta-lactamase production 
      is currently not a problem with A. actinomycetemcomitans as it has been reported 
      in oral anaerobes.

TI  - Structural analysis of pigeon lens crystallins by near-infrared Fourier transform
      Raman spectroscopy.
PG  - 401-12
AB  - Crystallins from pigeon eye lenses were isolated and purified by gel-permeation
      and anion-exchange chromatographies and characterized by gel electrophoresis,
      amino acid analysis and Raman spectroscopy. alpha- and beta-Crystallins could be 
      obtained in relatively pure forms by single-step size-exclusion chromatography
      whereas an extra step of ion-exchange chromatography was needed for the
      separation of delta crystallin from the beta-crystallin fraction. In contrast to 
      most characterized vertebrate species, a large amount of glycogen is eluted as a 
      high molecular form in the first peak of gel filtration column. Structural
      analyses of total crude soluble proteins and purified alpha-, beta- and
      delta-crystallin fractions were made with respect to their amino acid
      compositions and characteristic near-IR Fourier-transform Raman spectra. The
      results indicate that the major secondary structures of alpha- and
      beta-crystallins are mainly anti-parallel beta-pleated sheet in nature as judged 
      by the Raman signals at 1242 (amide III) and 1669-1670 cm-1 (amide I) whereas
      delta-crystallin consists of a significant content of alpha-helices as evidenced 
      by the Raman signal at 1657-1660 cm-1 (amide I). The low intensity of S-S
      disulfide stretching vibration at 508-510 cm-1 coupled with the presence of S-H
      stretching at 2560-2580 cm-1 for alpha-, beta- and delta-crystallin pointed to
      the fact that sulfhydryl groups in most crystallins are resistant to air
      oxidation during the process of homogenization and protein extraction. It is also
      found that the relative Raman signal intensities of Tyr, Phe, and Trp residues in
      purified crystallins correlate very well with the data obtained from amino acid
      analysis. Especially noteworthy is the demonstrated usefulness of applying Raman 
      techniques in the detection of the microenvironments of the aromatic amino acids 
      such as Tyr and Trp in the native crystallins, which may prove useful in the
      study of contribution of these aromatic residues to crystallin packing and
      stability.

TI  - Isolation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the air plume downwind of a swine
      confined or concentrated animal feeding operation.
PG  - 1032-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the levels of antibiotic- and
      multidrug-resistant bacteria in bioaerosols upwind, within, and downwind at
      locations 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, and 150 m from a swine confined animal feeding
      operation. DESIGN: We used Andersen two-stage samplers to collect bacterial
      samples, the replicate plate method to isolate organisms, and the Kirby-Bauer
      disk diffusion method to determine antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: The percentage
      of organisms resistant to at least two antibiotic classes and all four classes
      evaluated were, respectively, 2.1 and 3.0 times higher inside (n = 69) than
      upwind (n = 59) of the facility. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent
      organism recovered. Concentrations of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus decreased
      with increasing distance from the facility. Using Fisher's exact methods, the
      change in distribution of antibiotic resistance profiles for each antibiotic was 
      statistically significant (oxytetracycline, p = 0.010; tetracycline, p = 0.014;
      ampicillin, p = 0.007; erythromycin, p = 0.035); however, this relationship was
      not seen with lincomycin and penicillin (p > 0.05) . In addition, the levels of
      antibiotic-resistant S.aureus 25 m downwind were significantly greater than the
      levels from samples taken upwind from the facility for the same four antibiotics 
      (p < 0.05) . The percentage of resistant group A streptococci and fecal coliform 
      increased within the facility compared with upwind values for all antibiotics
      evaluated,except for lincomycin. The percentage of resistant total coliform
      organisms increased within the facility compared with upwind values for
      oxytetracycline and tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial concentrations with
      multiple antibiotic resistances or multidrug resistance were recovered inside and
      outside to (at least) 150 m downwind of this facility at higher percentages than 
      upwind. Bacterial concentrations with multiple antibiotic resistances were found 
      within and downwind of the facility even after subtherapeutic antibiotics were
      discontinued. This could pose a potential human health effect for those who work 
      within or live in close proximity to these facilities.

TI  - Systematic Analysis of Hollow Fiber Model of Tuberculosis Experiments.
PG  - S10-7
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The in vitro hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB), in
      tandem with Monte Carlo experiments, was introduced more than a decade ago. Since
      then, it has been used to perform a large number of tuberculosis
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studies that have not been subjected to
      systematic analysis. METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify all
      HFS-TB experiments published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012. There
      was no exclusion of articles by language. Bias minimization was according to
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).
      Steps for reporting systematic reviews were followed. RESULTS: There were 22
      HFS-TB studies published, of which 12 were combination therapy studies and 10
      were monotherapy studies. There were 4 stand-alone Monte Carlo experiments that
      utilized quantitative output from the HFS-TB. All experiments reported drug
      pharmacokinetics, which recapitulated those encountered in humans. HFS-TB studies
      included log-phase growth studies under ambient air, semidormant bacteria at pH
      5.8, and nonreplicating persisters at low oxygen tension of </= 10 parts per
      billion. The studies identified antibiotic exposures associated with optimal kill
      of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and suppression of acquired drug resistance (ADR)
      and informed predictions about optimal clinical doses, expected performance of
      standard doses and regimens in patients, and expected rates of ADR, as well as a 
      proposal of new susceptibility breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The HFS-TB model offers 
      the ability to perform PK/PD studies including humanlike drug exposures, to
      identify bactericidal and sterilizing effect rates, and to identify exposures
      associated with suppression of drug resistance. Because of the ability to perform
      repetitive sampling from the same unit over time, the HFS-TB vastly improves
      statistical power and facilitates the execution of time-to-event analyses and
      repeated event analyses, as well as dynamic system pharmacology mathematical
      models.

TI  - Hindering the formation and promoting the dispersion of medical biofilms:
      non-lethal effects of seagrass extracts.
PG  - 168
LID - 10.1186/s12906-018-2232-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms have great significance in healthcare-associated infections 
      owing to their inherent tolerance and resistance to antimicrobial therapies. New 
      approaches to prevent and treat unwanted biofilms are urgently required. To this 
      end, three seagrass species (Enhalus acoroides, Halophila ovalis and Halodule
      pinifolia) collected in Vietnam and in India were investigated for their effects 
      in mediating non-lethal interactions on sessile bacterial (Escherichia coli) and 
      fungal (Candida albicans) cultures. The present study was focused on anti-biofilm
      activities of seagrass extracts, without killing cells. METHODS: Methanolic
      extracts were characterized, and major compounds were identified by MS/MS
      analysis. The antibiofilm properties of the seagrass extracts were tested at
      sub-lethal concentrations by using microtiter plate adhesion assay. The
      performance of the most promising extract was further investigated in elegant
      bioreactors to reproduce mature biofilms both at the solid/liquid and the
      solid/air interfaces. Dispersion and bioluminescent assays were carried out to
      decipher the mode of action of the bioactive extract. RESULTS: It was shown that 
      up to 100 ppm of crude extracts did not adversely affect microbial growth, nor do
      they act as a carbon and energy source for the selected microorganisms. Seagrass 
      extracts appear to be more effective in deterring microbial adhesion on
      hydrophobic surfaces than on hydrophilic. The results revealed that non-lethal
      concentrations of E. acoroides leaf extract: i) reduce bacterial and fungal
      coverage by 60.9 and 73.9%, respectively; ii) affect bacterial biofilm maturation
      and promote dispersion, up to 70%, in fungal biofilm; iii) increase luminescence 
      in Vibrio harveyi by 25.8%. The characterization of methanolic extracts showed
      the unique profile of the E. acoroides leaf extract. CONCLUSIONS: E. acoroides
      leaf extract proved to be the most promising extract among those tested. Indeed, 
      the selected non-lethal concentrations of E. acoroides leaf extract were found to
      exert an antibiofilm effect on C. albicans and E. coli biofilm in the first phase
      of biofilm genesis, opening up the possibility of developing preventive
      strategies to hinder the adhesion of microbial cells to surfaces. The leaf
      extract also affected the dispersion and maturation steps in C. albicans and E.
      coli respectively, suggesting an important role in cell signaling processes.

TI  - In vitro anti-Herpes simplex virus activity of crude extract of the roots of
      Nauclea latifolia Smith (Rubiaceae).
PG  - 266
LID - 10.1186/1472-6882-13-266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nauclea latifolia Smith, a shrub belonging to the family Rubiaceae is
      a very popular medicinal plant in Cameroon and neighboring countries where it is 
      used to treat jaundice, yellow fever, rheumatism, abdominal pains, hepatitis,
      diarrhea, dysentery, hypertension, as well as diabetes. The ethno-medicinal use
      against yellow fever, jaundice and diarrhea prompted us to investigate on the
      antiviral activity of the root bark of N. latifolia. In this study, HSV-2 was
      chosen as a viral model because of its strong impact on HIV transmission and
      acquisition. METHODS: The crude extract under study was prepared by maceration of
      air-dried and powdered roots barks of N. latifolia in CH2Cl2/MeOH (50:50) mixture
      for 48 hours, then it was subjected to filtration and evaporation under vacuum. A
      phytochemical analysis of the crude extract was performed by High Performance
      Liquid Chromatography coupled with a photodiode array and mass spectrometry
      (HPLC-PDA-ESI-qMS). The anti-HSV-2 activity was assayed in vitro by plaque
      reduction and virus yield assays and the major mechanism of action was
      investigated by virucidal and time of addition assays. Data values were compared 
      using the Extra sum of squares F test of program GraphPad PRISM 4. RESULTS: The
      main components detected in the extract belong to the class of indole alkaloids
      characteristic of Nauclea genus. Strictosamide, vincosamide and pumiloside were
      tentatively identified together with quinovic acid glycoside. N. latifolia crude 
      extract inhibited both acyclovir sensitive and acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains,
      with IC50 values of 5.38 mug/ml for the former and 7.17 mug/ml for the latter.
      The extract was found to be most active when added post-infection, with IC50 of
      3.63 mug/ml. CONCLUSION: The results of this work partly justify the empirical
      use of N. latifolia in traditional medicine for the treatment of viral diseases. 
      This extract could be a promising rough material for the development of a new and
      more effective modern anti-HSV-2 medication also active against
      acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 strains.

TI  - Farm-to-fork characterization of Escherichia coli associated with feedlot cattle 
      with a known history of antimicrobial use.
PG  - 40-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2009.11.008 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated antimicrobial-resistant (AR) Escherichia coli isolated
      from "farm-to-fork" production of cattle fed diets containing the antimicrobial
      growth promoter (AGP) chlortetracycline plus sulfamethazine (44ppm each, AS700)
      or no AGP (control). For each treatment, samples included: feces just prior to
      euthanization; hides after euthanization; intestinal digesta from the lower
      digestive tract; carcasses immediately after evisceration and after 24h in the
      chiller; and ground beef stored at 5 degrees C for 1 and 8days. Samples were also
      collected from the abattoir environment and from air during hide removal. Total, 
      ampicillin (Amp(r))-, and tetracycline (Tet(r))-resistant E. coli were isolated
      on MacConkey agar or MacConkey agar containing ampicillin or tetracycline,
      respectively. Amp(r) and Tet(r)E. coli were isolated from the feces and hides of 
      all cattle. Compared to the control, the prevalence of Amp(r) (26.5% vs. 7.9%)
      and Tet(r) (50.9% vs. 12.6%) E. coli was greater in feces from AS700 treated
      animals (P<0.05), but was similar between treatments for hide samples (P>0.05).
      The prevalence of carcass or ground beef contamination with AR E. coli was not
      different between treatments. Resistant E. coli were isolated from the abattoir
      environment after processing of both groups of cattle. Susceptibilities to 11
      antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses were
      conducted on 360 Amp(r) and Tet(r)E. coli isolates. Twenty-five antibiogram
      profiles were detected, with isolates exhibiting resistance to up to 9
      antimicrobials. Most (28.2%) Amp(r)E. coli were also resistant to streptomycin
      and tetracycline, whereas Tet(r)E. coli (53.5%) were mainly resistant to only
      tetracycline. Thirty one genotypes were detected by PFGE with most isolates from 
      meat and environmental samples having similar genetic profiles to isolates from
      hides or digesta. These data demonstrate that antimicrobial-resistant E. coli can
      contaminate meat products during slaughter and enter the food chain regardless of
      whether or not cattle are administered AGP. The abundance of AR E. coli on the
      hides of animals is likely a key element for controlling end-product
      contamination.

TI  - [The success of hygiene in the last 40 years].
PG  - 271-94
AB  - In Germany, the last period of the Second World War and the following years were 
      characterized by deficiencies of hygiene which had not occurred previously in
      Middle Europe during the 20th century. There were focuses of typhus, typhoid
      fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and meningitis. Insufficiencies
      in the removal of faeces caused high incidences of shigellosis, hepatitis A, and 
      ascariasis. As a result of insufficient body care, many people were infested with
      fleas, lice and scabies. The migration of large proportions of the population
      resulted in an increasing prevalence of syphilis an gonorrhea. As the population 
      resettled, the first steps towards reorganization of public health could be done.
      The spread of typhoid fever was controlled by drinking-water disinfection with
      chlorine, repair of sewage systems, and patient isolation. The application of DDT
      helped to reduce scabies and pediculosis, resulting in decreasing typhus risks.
      During the first two decades after the war, there was a steady decrease of the
      incidence of infectious diseases. The reconstruction of the towns resulted in
      improved housing conditions and a decreasing number of persons per housing area, 
      reducing the intensity of physical contacts of the inhabitants with each other.
      The nutrition and clothing situation of the population improved, which, in
      addition to a general rise of the standards of hygiene, brought about an increase
      of the individual resistance to infection. A further reduction of sporadic and
      epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases was achieved by the introduction of
      chemotherapy and antibiotics. Increasing prosperity was accompanied by new
      problems of hygiene. Infectious diseases almost eradicated in West Germany, were 
      imported by air travellers. Ten imported cases of smallpox were reported between 
      1957 and 1972, eight of which originated from Southeast Asia. Malaria, imported
      by German and foreign soldiers, had not been uncommon after the end of the war
      but had been easy to control by insecticides and antimalarials. As tourism
      expanded, a new wave of imported malaria cases was reported. In West Germany
      there is, however, no more spread of the disease under present conditions,
      cholera caused similar problems. The 1961 cholera epidemic started in Southeast
      Asia and caused minor outbreaks in Mediterranean countries like Italy and Spain. 
      A significant spread of the disease throughout Europe was prevented by generally 
      high standards of drinking water and sewage treatment. Sporadic cases of typhoid 
      fever were imported from countries with low standards of hygiene.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Treatment of raw poultry with nonthermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma to
      reduce Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica.
PG  - 22-8
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-153 [doi]
AB  - Nonthermal plasma has been shown to be effective in reducing pathogens on the
      surface of a range of fresh produce products. The research presented here
      investigated the effectiveness of nonthermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma 
      on Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni inoculated onto the surface of
      boneless skinless chicken breast and chicken thigh with skin. Chicken samples
      were inoculated with antibiotic-resistant strains of S. enterica and C. jejuni at
      levels of 10(1) to 10(4) CFU and exposed to plasma for a range of time points (0 
      to 180 s in 15-s intervals). Surviving antibiotic-resistant pathogens were
      recovered and counted on appropriate agar. In order to determine the effect of
      plasma on background microflora, noninoculated skinless chicken breast and thighs
      with skin were exposed to air plasma at ambient pressure. Treatment with plasma
      resulted in elimination of low levels (10(1) CFU) of both S. enterica and C.
      jejuni on chicken breasts and C. jejuni from chicken skin, but viable S. enterica
      cells remained on chicken skin even after 20 s of exposure to plasma. Inoculum
      levels of 10(2), 10(3), and 10(4) CFU of S. enterica on chicken breast and
      chicken skin resulted in maximum reduction levels of 1.85, 2.61, and 2.54 log,
      respectively, on chicken breast and 1.25, 1.08, and 1.31 log, respectively, on
      chicken skin following 3 min of plasma exposure. Inoculum levels of 10(2), 10(3),
      and 10(4) CFU of C. jejuni on chicken breast and chicken skin resulted in maximum
      reduction levels of 1.65, 2.45, and 2.45 log, respectively, on chicken breast and
      1.42, 1.87, and 3.11 log, respectively, on chicken skin following 3 min of plasma
      exposure. Plasma exposure for 30 s reduced background microflora on breast and
      skin by an average of 0.85 and 0.21 log, respectively. This research demonstrates
      the feasibility of nonthermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma as an
      intervention to help reduce foodborne pathogens on the surface of raw poultry.

TI  - An antifungal protein from the marine bacterium streptomyces sp. Strain AP77 is
      specific for Pythium porphyrae, a causative agent of red rot disease in Porphyra 
      spp.
PG  - 2666-75
AB  - A novel antifungal protein (SAP) was found in the culture supernatant of a marine
      bacterium, Streptomyces sp. strain AP77, and was purified. This protein was
      characterized by chemical, biochemical, and biological analyses. By using gel
      filtration, the molecular mass of SAP was estimated to be 160 kDa. Structural
      analysis of SAP by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
      suggested that SAP is composed of three heterologous protein subunits of 41.7 kDa
      (SAP1), 21.7 kDa (SAP2), and 18.7 kDa (SAP3) at a molar ratio of 1:1:5 (or
      1:1:6). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis and a homology search revealed
      that SAP1, SAP2, and SAP3 exhibit 64.3, 68.4, and 86.7% similarity to three
      Streptomyces coelicolor polypeptides, puromycin resistance protein (Pur8), a
      conserved hypothetical protein, and bacterioferritin, respectively. The MIC of
      purified SAP against Pythium porphyrae was determined to be 1.6 microg/disk,
      whereas no inhibitory effect was observed at concentrations up to 100 microg/disk
      against most of the fungal and bacterial strains tested; the only exception was
      relatively strong antifungal activity against Pythium ultimum (MIC, 6.3
      microg/disk). In vitro and in vivo toxicity tests demonstrated that SAP showed no
      toxicity against Porphyra yezoensis cells, human normal dermal fibroblasts, and
      mice at doses up to 700 microg/ml (for 24 h), 250 microg/ml (for 12 h), and 75
      mg/kg (for 35 days), respectively. SAP was labile when it was subjected to a
      heated-air drying treatment, which is a great advantage in food production
      procedures. These results indicated that Streptomyces sp. strain AP77 might be
      useful as a gene source for safe transgenic Porphyra breeding for tolerance to
      Pythium infection.

AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen that causes a wide
      variety of cutaneous and systemic infections. Although originally thought to be
      an extracellular bacterium, numerous studies have demonstrated that GAS can
      trigger internalization into nonimmune cells to escape from immune surveillance
      or antibiotic-mediated killing. Epithelial cells possess a defense mechanism
      involving autophagy-mediated targeting and killing of GAS within lysosome-fused
      autophagosomes. In endothelial cells, in contrast, we previously showed that
      autophagy is not sufficient for GAS killing. In the present study, we showed
      higher galectin-3 (Gal-3) expression and lower Gal-8 expression in endothelial
      cells than in epithelial cells. The recruitment of Gal-3 to GAS is higher and the
      recruitment of Gal-8 to GAS is lower in endothelial cells than in epithelial
      cells. We further showed that Gal-3 promotes GAS replication and diminishes the
      recruitment of Gal-8 and ubiquitin, the latter of which is a critical protein for
      autophagy sequestration. After knockdown of Gal-3 in endothelial cells, the
      colocalization of Gal-8, parkin, and ubiquitin-decorated GAS is significantly
      increased, as is the interaction of Gal-8 and parkin, an E3 ligase. Furthermore, 
      inhibition of Gal-8 in epithelial cells attenuates recruitment of parkin; both
      Gal-8 and parkin contribute to ubiquitin recruitment and GAS elimination. Animal 
      studies confirmed that Gal-3-knockout mice develop less-severe skin damage and
      that GAS replication can be detected only in the air pouch and not in organs and 
      endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that Gal-3 inhibits ubiquitin
      recruitment by blocking Gal-8 and parkin recruitment, resulting in GAS
      replication in endothelial cells.IMPORTANCE In epithelial cells, GAS can be
      efficiently killed within the lysosome-fused autophaosome compartment. However,
      we previously showed that, in spite of LC-3 recruitment, the autophagic machinery
      is not sufficient for GAS killing in endothelial cells. In this report, we
      provide the first evidence that Gal-3, highly expressed in endothelial cells,
      blocks the tagging of ubiquitin to GAS by inhibiting recruitment of Gal-8 and
      parkin, leading to an enhancement of GAS replication. We also provide the first
      demonstration that Gal-8 can interact with parkin, the critical E3 ligase, for
      resistance to intracellular bacteria by facilitating the decoration of bacteria
      with ubiquitin chains. Our findings reveal that differential levels of Gal-3 and 
      Gal-8 expression and recruitment to GAS between epithelial cells and endothelial 
      cells may contribute to the different outcomes of GAS elimination or survival and
      growth of GAS in these two types of cells.

BTI - Exploring Health and Environmental Costs of Food: Workshop Summary
AB  - The U.S. food system provides many benefits, not the least of which is a safe,
      nutritious and consistent food supply. However, the same system also creates
      significant environmental, public health, and other costs that generally are not 
      recognized and not accounted for in the retail price of food. These include
      greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil erosion, air pollution, and their
      environmental consequences, the transfer of antibiotic resistance from food
      animals to human, and other human health outcomes, including foodborne illnesses 
      and chronic disease. Some external costs which are also known as externalities
      are accounted for in ways that do not involve increasing the price of food. But
      many are not. They are borne involuntarily by society at large. A better
      understanding of external costs would help decision makers at all stages of the
      life cycle to expand the benefits of the U.S. food system even further. The
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the National Research Council (NRC) with support 
      from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a public 
      workshop on April 23-23, 2012, to explore the external costs of food,
      methodologies for quantifying those costs, and the limitations of the
      methodologies. The workshop was intended to be an information-gathering activity 
      only. Given the complexity of the issues and the broad areas of expertise
      involved, workshop presentations and discussions represent only a small portion
      of the current knowledge and are by no means comprehensive. The focus was on the 
      environmental and health impacts of food, using externalities as a basis for
      discussion and animal products as a case study. The intention was not to quantify
      costs or benefits, but rather to lay the groundwork for doing so. A major goal of
      the workshop was to identify information sources and methodologies required to
      recognize and estimate the costs and benefits of environmental and public health 
      consequences associated with the U.S. food system. It was anticipated that the
      workshop would provide the basis for a follow-up consensus study of the subject
      and that a central task of the consensus study will be to develop a framework for
      a full-scale accounting of the environmental and public health effects for all
      food products of the U.S. food system. Exploring Health and Environmental Costs
      of Food: Workshop Summary provides the basis for a follow-up planning discussion 
      involving members of the IOM Food and Nutrition Board and the NRC Board on
      Agriculture and Natural Resources and others to develop the scope and areas of
      expertise needed for a larger-scale, consensus study of the subject.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Cross-contamination of foods from persistent pathogen reservoirs is a
      known risk factor in processing environments. Industry requires a rapid,
      waterless, zero-contact, chemical-free method for removing pathogens from food
      contact surfaces. Cold plasma was tested for its ability to inactivate Salmonella
      biofilms. A 3-strain Salmonella culture was grown to form adherent biofilms for
      24, 48, or 72 h on a test surface (glass slides). These were placed on a conveyor
      belt and passed at various line speeds to provide exposure times of 5, 10, or 15 
      s. The test plate was either 5 or 7.5 cm under a plasma jet emitter operating at 
      1 atm using filtered air as the feed gas. The frequency of high-voltage
      electricity was varied from 23 to 48 kHz. At the closer spacing (5 cm), cold
      plasma reduced Salmonella biofilms by up to 1.57 log CFU/mL (5 s), 1.82 log
      CFU/mL (10 s), and 2.13 log CFU/mL (15 s). Increasing the distance to 7.5 cm
      generally reduced the efficacy of the 15 s treatment, but had variable effects on
      the 5 and 10 s treatments. Variation of the high-voltage electricity had a
      greater effect on 10 and 15 s treatments, particularly at the 7.5 cm spacing. For
      each combination of time, distance, and frequency, Salmonella biofilms of 24, 48,
      and 72 h growth responded consistently with each other. The results show that
      short treatments with cold plasma yielded up to a 2.13 log reduction of a durable
      form of Salmonella contamination on a model food contact surface. This technology
      shows promise as a possible tool for rapid disinfection of materials associated
      with food processing. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pathogens such as Salmonella can
      form chemical-resistant biofilms, making them difficult to remove from food
      contact surfaces. A 15 s treatment with cold plasma reduced mature Salmonella
      biofilms by up to 2.13 log CFU/mL (99.3%). This contact-free, waterless method
      uses no chemical sanitizers. Cold plasma may therefore have a practical
      application for conveyor belts, equipment, and other food contact surfaces where 
      a rapid, dry antimicrobial process is required.

AB  - History A 31-year-old woman with a history of bilateral orthotopic lung
      transplantation performed 10 months earlier for cystic fibrosis presented for a
      routine follow-up appointment, with her chief symptom being a cough. The cough
      started approximately 1 month prior to this appointment and was minimally
      productive of clear to yellow phlegm. In addition to her cough, she reported
      increased sinus congestion and a sensation of "something in her upper chest." She
      denied shortness of breath, wheezing, hemoptysis, or cigarette smoking. Review of
      systems was negative for fever, chills, or night sweats. At physical examination,
      the patient was afebrile, borderline tachycardic (heart rate, 99 beats per
      minute), and mildly hypertensive (blood pressure, 138/99 mm Hg). Oxygen
      saturation was 96% on room air. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell
      count of 3.5 x 10(9)/L (normal range, 3.2-9.8 x 10(9)/L). Pulmonary function
      testing was notable for a newly decreased ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 
      second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 64% (2.0 and 3.4 L, respectively)
      (normal FEV1-to-FVC ratio, 80%), suggesting an obstructive lung process. One
      month prior to presentation, the patient's sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient showed no evidence of
      active infection at the time of bronchoscopy. Thus, the bacteria were favored to 
      reflect colonization, and antibiotic therapy was not administered at that time.
      The patient was taking an immunosuppression regimen of mycophenalate mofetil
      (CellCept; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) (1 g twice daily), prednisone (10 mg 
      daily), and tacrolimus (Prograf; Astellas Pharma US, Northbrook, Ill) (goal
      therapeutic range, 12-14 ng/mL). The patient was sent for posteroanterior and
      lateral chest radiography followed by chest CT ( Figs 1 - 3 ) and fluorine 18
      fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT ( Fig 4 ). [Figure: see text][Figure: see text][Figure:

TI  - Unprecedented binding cooperativity between Cu(I) and Cu(II) in the copper
      resistance protein CopK from Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34: implications from
      structural studies by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.
PG  - 3549-64
LID - 10.1021/ja807354z [doi]
AB  - The bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is resistant to high environmental
      concentrations of many metal ions, including copper. This ability arises
      primarily from the presence of a large plasmid pMOL30 which includes a cluster of
      19 cop genes that respond to copper. One of the protein products CopK is induced 
      at high levels and is expressed to the periplasm as a small soluble protein (8.3 
      kDa). Apo-CopK associates in solution to form a dimer (K(D) approximately 10(-5) 
      M) whose structure was defined by NMR and X-ray crystallography. The individual
      molecules feature two antiparallel beta-sheets arranged in a sandwich-like
      structure and interact through C-terminal beta-strands. It binds Cu(II) with low 
      affinity (K(D)(Cu(II)) > 10(-6) M) but Cu(I) with high affinity (K(D)(Cu(I)) = 2 
      x 10(-11) M). Cu(I)-CopK was also a dimer in the solid state and featured a
      distorted tetrahedral site Cu(I)(S-Met)(3)(NCS). The isothiocyanato ligand
      originated from the crystallization solution. Binding of Cu(I) or Ag(I), but not 
      of Cu(II), favored the monomeric form in solution. While Ag(I)-CopK was stable as
      isolated, Cu(I)-CopK was moderately air-sensitive due to a strong binding
      cooperativity between Cu(I) and Cu(II). This was documented by determination of
      the Cu(I) and Cu(II) binding affinities in the presence of the other ion:
      K(D)(Cu(I)) = 2 x 10(-13) M and K(D)(Cu(II)) = 3 x 10(-12) M, that is, binding of
      Cu(II) increased the affinity for Cu(I) by a factor of approximately 10(2) and
      binding of Cu(I) increased the affinity for Cu(II) by a factor of at least 10(6).
      Stable forms of both Cu(I)Cu(II)-CopK and Ag(I)Cu(II)-CopK were isolated readily.
      Consistent with this unprecedented copper binding chemistry, NMR spectroscopy
      detected three distinct forms: apo-CopK, Cu(I)-CopK and Cu(I)Cu(II)-CopK that do 
      not exchange on the NMR time scale. This information provides a valuable guide to
      the role of CopK in copper resistance.

TI  - Brewers dried yeast as a source of mannan oligosaccharides for weanling pigs.
PG  - 2619-28
AB  - Brewers dried yeast, a source of mannan oligosaccharides (MOS), was assessed as
      an alternative to an antimicrobial agent (carbadox) for young pigs in two
      experiments. The yeast contained 5.2% MOS. Agglutination tests confirmed
      adsorption of several serovars of E. coli and Salmonella spp. onto the yeast
      product. In Exp. 1, seven replicates (five pigs per pen) of 22-d-old pigs were
      fed a nonmedicated basal diet or the basal diet with carbadox (55 mg/kg), yeast
      (3%), or a combination of 3% yeast and 2% citric acid for 28 d. Carbadox did not 
      improve growth performance. Growth rate and feed intake were depressed (P < 0.05)
      in pigs fed yeast alone or in combination with acid. Log counts of total
      coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens in feces were not
      affected by diet, but Bifidobacteria spp. counts were lower (P < 0.05) in pigs
      fed the yeast + acid diet and lactobacilli counts were higher (P < 0.05) in pigs 
      fed yeast. Fecal pH and VFA concentrations and intestinal morphological traits
      were not consistently affected by diet. Serum IgG levels were elevated in the
      yeast + acid (P < 0.01) group. In Exp. 2, the effects of yeast and carbadox
      additions to the diet on enteric microbial populations in young pigs housed in
      isolation units were evaluated. Pigs (n = 24) were weaned at 11 d of age (4.1 kg 
      BW) and placed in isolation chambers (two pigs per chamber) equipped with
      individual air filtering systems and excrement containers. Treatments were a
      nonmedicated basal diet and the basal diet with 55 mg/kg of carbadox or with 3%
      yeast. Diets were fed for 29 d, then each pig was orally dosed with approximately
      9.5 x 10(8) CFU of E. coli K88. Daily fecal E. coli K88 counts were not different
      (P > 0.05) among treatments, but fecal shedding of carbadox-resistant coliforms
      was higher (P < 0.01) during the 9-d period in pigs fed carbadox. Total fecal
      coliforms were consistently lower throughout the postinoculation period in pigs
      fed yeast (P < 0.05). Yeast reduced colonization oftotal coliforms in the
      duodenum,jejunum, cecum, and colon, but it did not have a consistent effect on
      colonization of E. coli K88. Pigs fed yeast tended (P < 0.10) to have higher
      serum IgG levels than controls. In these experiments, brewers dried yeast and
      carbadox had minimal effects on growth, microbial populations, and intestinal
      health traits of early-weaned pigs, but certain serum immunological traits were
      enhanced by feeding yeast.

TI  - Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 1204-13; discussion 1213-5
AB  - Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause morbidity,
      hospital admissions, and mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality
      of life. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are associated 
      with considerable physiologic deterioration and increased airway inflammation.
      About half of COPD exacerbations are caused or triggered primarily by bacterial
      and viral infections (colds, especially from rhinovirus), but air pollution can
      contribute to the beginning of an exacerbation. Type 1 exacerbations involve
      increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; Type 2 exacerbations
      involve any two of the latter symptoms, and Type 3 exacerbations involve one of
      those symptoms combined with cough, wheeze, or symptoms of an upper respiratory
      tract infection. Exacerbations are more common than previously believed (2.5-3
      exacerbations per year); many exacerbations are treated in the community and not 
      associated with hospital admission. We found that about half of exacerbations
      were unreported by the patients, despite considerable encouragement to do so,
      and, instead, were only diagnosed from patients' diary cards. COPD patients are
      accustomed to frequent symptom changes, and this may explain their tendency to
      underreport exacerbations. COPD patients tend to be anxious and depressed about
      the disease and some might not seek treatment. At the beginning of an
      exacerbation physiologic changes such as decreases in peak flow and forced
      expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)) are usually small and therefore
      are not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger decreases in peak flow are
      associated with dyspnea and the presence of symptomatic upper-respiratory viral
      infection. More pronounced physiologic changes during exacerbation are related to
      longer exacerbation recovery time. Dyspnea, common colds, sore throat, and cough 
      increase significantly during prodrome, indicating that respiratory viruses are
      important exacerbation triggers. However, the prodrome is relatively short and
      not useful in predicting onset. As colds are associated with longer and more
      severe exacerbations, a COPD patient who develops a cold should be considered for
      early therapy. Physiologic recovery after an exacerbation is often incomplete,
      which decreases health-related quality of life and resistance to future
      exacerbations, so it is important to identify COPD patients who suffer frequent
      exacerbations and to convince them to take precautions to minimize the risk of
      colds and other exacerbation triggers. Exacerbation frequency may vary with the
      severity of the COPD. Exacerbation frequency may or may not increase with the
      severity of the COPD. As the COPD progresses, exacerbations tend to have more
      symptoms and take longer to recover from. Twenty-five to fifty percent of COPD
      patients suffer lower airway bacteria colonization, which is related to the
      severity of COPD and cigarette smoking and which begins a cycle of epithelial
      cell damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, mucus hypersecretion, increased
      submucosal vascular leakage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Elevated sputum 
      interleukin-8 levels are associated with higher bacterial load and faster FEV(1) 
      decline; the bacteria increase airway inflammation in the stable patient, which
      may accelerate disease progression. A 2-week course of oral corticosteroids is as
      beneficial as an 8-week course, with fewer adverse effects, and might extend the 
      time until the next exacerbation. Antibiotics have some efficacy in treating
      exacerbations. Exacerbation frequency increases with progressive airflow
      obstruction; so patients with chronic respiratory failure are particularly
      susceptible to exacerbation.

TI  - [The tonsils and adenoids as a site of infection and the cause of obstruction].
PG  - 237-47
AB  - The failure to eradicate group A beta-hemolytic streptococci from the pharynx is 
      partly due to a low compliance, but above all, an alteration of the oropharyngeal
      microbiological flora: reduction of alpha-haemolytic streptococci which inhibit
      group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and increase of microorganisms such as
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. These
      latter act indirectly destroying the beta-lactamic ring of penicillins. However, 
      this obstacle is overcome by the use of antibiotics which do not contain
      beta-lactamic rings such as macrolides or associating amoxicillin with clavulanic
      acid or with new cephalosporins which are more resistant to beta lactamases. To
      restrict the diffusion of resistance to antibiotics, it is essential to limit
      their use diagnosing streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis more precisely, thanks to 
      an improved use of micro-biological diagnostic tests and by a more extended use
      of tonsillectomy in recurrent tonsillitis (more than 6-7 in 1-2 years).
      Adenoiditis is closely related to the post nasal drip syndrome, to recurrent
      otitis media and to otitis media with effusion. All these situations could,
      therefore, represent an indication, although not well defined, for adenoidectomy.
      Nasopharyngeal obstruction due to adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy becomes critical
      during sleep when the hypotony of the upper airway muscles becomes additional to 
      the anatomical obstruction. At this point the inspiratory effort required and the
      consequent decrease of intra airway pressure increase the pharyngeal obstruction 
      suctioning the pharyngeal walls toward the median line. The resulting clinical
      picture is defined as sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) due to adenotonsillar
      hypertrophy (idiopathic), to be distinguished from SDB due to cranio-facial
      abnormalities or neuromuscular diseases. SDB includes both the more serious sleep
      apnea syndrome and the less severe upper airway respiratory resistance syndrome. 
      A combination of symptoms and clinical data detectable both while awake or
      asleep, make the diagnosis simple. During sleep, both apnea and paradoxical
      inspiratory movements are highly specific while snoring is highly sensitive. To
      evaluate nasopharyngeal obstruction radiography and optic fibre endoscopy are
      both equally reliable. The gold standard test for non idiopathic SDB is the
      polysomnography, whereas for SDB, due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, one is
      limited today to the recording during sleep of O2 saturation or of end tidal CO2.
      These investigations are, however, generally used up to 2 years of age, when the 
      decision to carry out an adenoidectomy and especially a tonsillectomy is more
      difficult because of the greater risks which surgery involves at this age. The
      pharmacological therapy has a purely palliative function and is based on
      antibiotics, local vasoconstrictors, steroids and theophylline which acts more as
      an antiflogistic than as a breath stimulant. O2 therapy and nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) give better results, but are more difficult to
      carry out, in particular on a long term basis. Adenoidectomy especially if
      associated with tonsillectomy, leads to the resolution of the symptoms, but not
      always to a normalization of functional alterations (hypoxia and hypercapnia).
      For this reason, it is necessary to act on other factors which cause oedema of
      the nasopharyngeal mucosa contributing to the obstruction. In this area, the
      prevention of viral infections can be achieved by vaccination against influenza
      and by preventing the child from attending crowded day care centers. With regard 
      to allergic inflammation, skin prick tests could be a first step in view of
      allergens avoidance measures. With regard to indoor air pollution, passive smoke 
      must be stopped and the child kept out of the kitchen.

TI  - Assessment of the Efficacy of New Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs.
PG  - 59-76
AB  - The pathology of tuberculosis in humans starts with an initial Ghon focus in the 
      lungs followed by transmission of bacilli though the blood and lymph to other
      regions in the lungs and to other organs. While these bacilli usually lie latent 
      without causing further disease, some 10% start foci of adult type disease
      usually starting in the sub-apical regions of the lungs. Bacilli multiply,
      killing tissue by caseation and then forming colonies within the caseum. Cavities
      form connecting to the air in whose walls vigorous bacillary multiplication
      occurs. The history of the development of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy is
      described, starting with the use of multi-drug regimens to prevent the emergence 
      of drug resistance and continuing with the shortening of the treatment period to 
      6 months by the incorporation in the regimens of rifampicin and pyrazinamide,
      which are the two drug responsible for bactericidal activity during treatment.
      Prospects for further shortening of treatment rest with the introduction of
      higher dosage with rifamycins and with new anti-tuberculosis drugs. These new
      drugs include the 8 methoxyfluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin which
      inhibit topoisomerases and protein formation, the diarylquinoline TM-207 which
      inhibits the mycobacterial ATP synthase and thus energy formation, the
      nitroimidazopyran PA-824 and the closely related OPC-676832 which are pro-drugs
      with uncertain modes of action and the pyrrole SQ-109, a cell wall inhibitor.
      Anti-tuberculosis drugs have widely variable pharmacokinetic characteristics but 
      as they work efficiently together, it is unnecessary to match these when giving
      drug combinations. The effects of drug-drug interactions are usually small though
      the interactions with anti-retroviral drugs can pose problems. Dose sizes have
      usually been chosen to minimize side effects while retaining activity and thus
      tend to have low therapeutic margins, the exception being the margin of about 20 
      for isoniazid. The role of high plasma binding, important in limiting the
      efficacy of rifamycins, is uncertain for the newer drugs. Post antibiotic effects
      are vital to the prevention of drug resistance and need exploration for new
      drugs. The main aims of current drug development are (1) to shorten treatment,
      and (2) to make it more convenient, by for instance using widely intermittent
      regimens. The current techniques for measuring efficacy during drug development
      start with in vitro models, including the Hu/Coates models, which should contain 
      bacterial populations resembling the bacterial persisters in lesions that are
      responsible for the long duration of treatment. The next stage is the mouse model
      of the chemotherapy of established tuberculosis, which has proved remarkably
      useful in assessing the value of the different drugs. The main problem in
      clinical assessment arises from the use of relapse after treatment as the main
      end-point, and the consequent need for very large numbers of patients required to
      provide measurable relapse rates in final phase III licensing studies. For this
      reason, surrogate studies are necessary in phase II which require much smaller
      numbers of patients. The first such investigations are phase IIA studies of early
      bactericidal activity which establish whether the drug given alone has
      bactericidal activity on cavitary bacilli and which can estimate the minimal
      effective dose of the drug, useful for decisions of dose size. The next step
      should be phase IIB studies which measure the rate of elimination of viable
      bacilli in sputum during the initial 8-weeks of treatment with various
      combinations of the new drug with established drugs. Measurement can be as (1)
      the proportion of patients with positive sputum at the end of the 8-weeks period,
      the easiest method but the least sensitive, or (2) as the speed with which sputum
      cultures become negative in a survival analysis, or (3) as the mean regression in
      modeling of serial sputum collections colony counts (SSCC). The relation between 
      these surrogate estimates and the amoun of treatment shortening that can be
      obtained has still to be worked out.

AB  - Terrorism [Byers et al.] is the intentional use of indiscriminate violence to
      create fear and terror as a means to achieve an ideological, financial,
      religious, or political aim. It is often used against non-combatant targets.
      Terror tactics may include biologic, chemical, nuclear, or explosive events.
      Biologic Bioterrorism is the intentional release of biological agents to cause
      illness or death in humans, animals, or plants. These agents may be bacteria,
      fungi, toxins, or viruses. They may be naturally occurring or human-modified. The
      agents are typically found in nature, but they may be altered in a laboratory to 
      increase their resistance to antibiotics, and ability to spread in the
      environment. Biological and chemical agents may be spread through the air, food, 
      or water. Terrorists use biological agents because they are often difficult to
      detect and illness onset may be delayed for hours to days increasing dispersal.
      Bioterrorism agents are a common choice for terrorists because they easy and
      inexpensive to produce, easy to disseminate, and can cause widespread effects.
      The challenge with bioweapons is that they may affect both enemy and friendly
      forces. Terrorists use biologic weapons as a method of creating mass panic. In
      the history of humanity, the intentional infliction of casualties on civilians
      was considered inappropriate. Civilians are usually not attacked for their own
      sake unless they happen to be living or working in an area that has tactical or
      strategic value. Unfortunately, bioterrorism agents are difficult to control and 
      affect military personnel as well as civilian men, woman, and children. In the
      last 100 years, the United States and the international community have
      experienced multiple acts of terrorism and bioterrorism which have targeted
      civilians. World War I: Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in
      France, Romania, Russia, and the United States by infecting horses and mules with
      glanders, a virulent disease. 1972: Two college students, Allen Schwander and
      Stephen Pera, were arrested for planning to poison the Chicago water supply with 
      typhoid bacteria. 1984: The Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh followers in Oregon attempted 
      to affect a local election by infecting doorknobs and salad bars in restaurants
      with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria. 1993: Aum Shinrikyo religious group
      released anthrax in Tokyo. 1995: Bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in
      Oklahoma City. 2001: Airline attack on the World Trade Center. 2001:
      Anthrax-laced of infectious anthrax were delivered to news media offices and the 
      US Congress. 2009: Medical center attack at a Fort Hood, Texas. 2014: Bombing of 
      the Boston Marathon. Present: Multiple bombings worldwide. Chemical During World 
      War I there was widespread use of chemical weapons that often affected the
      civilian population resulting in many deaths. Since this war, most countries have
      agreed not to use chemical and biologic weapons. Unfortunately, with our present 
      age of terrorism from individuals, splinter groups, and dictators, there is an
      ever-present risk that these agents will be used. Nuclear To date, other than the
      dropping of nuclear bombs by the United States to end World War II, there have
      been no recent acts of nuclear attack or nuclear terrorism. Nuclear terrorism is 
      an act of terrorism in which a terrorist organization detonates a nuclear device.
      The possibility of terrorist organizations using nuclear is considered plausible 
      as terrorists could acquire a nuclear weapon. However, despite thefts of small
      amounts of fissile material, all low-concern, there is no credible evidence any
      terrorist group has succeeded in obtaining the necessary multi-kilogram critical 
      mass amounts of weapons-grade plutonium required to make a nuclear weapon.
      Explosive It is, unfortunately, becoming a common event on an international scale
      when terrorists use explosive devices to inflict casualties on the civilian
      population. Terrorism Definitions What is terrorism? What is a mass casualty
      incident? The United Nations definition of terrorism describes it as "an
      anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-)
      clandestine individual, group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or
      political reasons, whereby-in contrast to assassination-the direct targets of
      violence are not the main targets." The Department of Defense defines terrorism
      as "the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by
      religious, political, or other ideological beliefs, to instill fear and coerce
      governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are usually political." The
      Federal Emergency Management Agency defines terrorism as "the use of force or
      violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the
      United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or ransom. Terrorists often
      use threats to create fear among the public, to try to convince citizens that
      their government is powerless to prevent terrorism, and to get immediate
      publicity for their cause". The US Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism 
      as "the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to
      intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment
      thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives." A mass casualty
      incident is defined terrorist act that generates more patients than available
      resources can manage using routine procedures. Terrorism is generally considered 
      to be the use of force or violence outside the law to create fear among citizens 
      with the intent to coerce some sort of action. Health professionals should be
      aware bioterrorism is a perfect vehicle for terrorists to strike fear into the
      hearts and minds of citizens in the hopes they will bend the will of the people
      to support their agendas. All health professionals need to be prepared for this
      potentially catastrophic event. [Aven et al. 2015]
